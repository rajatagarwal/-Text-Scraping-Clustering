A need to limit foreign numbers A need to limit foreign numbers With all the top clubs vying for the title and the Champions League, at least the FA Cup gave an opportunity for one or two of the younger lads at the major clubs to get a game in the first team. I don't personally like to see weakened sides in the competition, but it seems in some cases it's the only chance for the young lads to get some first-team experience. Over the years the influx of foreign players has affected the young Englishman more than anyone. I know you have to have freedom of movement but I do believe a time will come when countries will have to put a limit on the number of overseas players - including Europeans. I think the trend has become more noticeable since the influx of foreign bosses like Arsene Wenger, Claudio Ranieri and now Jose Mourinho. They seem to know the foreign market more than the English, although Chelsea appear to be signing one or two young Englishmen. When the foreigners first started coming into the country, I thought people like Dennis Bergkamp and Gianfranco Zola were absolutely magnificent. Zola is still the best player I have ever seen in my time as a manager. I don't think anybody would ever begrudge players like that because you would pay money to watch these individuals. But I think the problem now is that clubs, even at the lower level, find English players expensive. Agents are offering players left, right and centre who are not only cheap but can also come over on trial, which was unheard of in the past. Bolton are a good example. I never thought they could be successful, but Sam Allardyce has waved his magic wand and brought these players over. The technology that Sam uses has definitely paid off. He has all these databases on every foreign player. He is a unique person - I never thought you could have 10 different nations in a dressing room and still have a good team spirit! But Sam has proved that wrong over the last few years and will continue to do it. What Bolton have said is they can't pay large transfer fees but they can get these players in for 6-12 months and compete at a high level that way. My view about foreign players changed about three years ago when I had quite a large number of them at Bramall Lane. The match we played with West Brom which was abandoned after we went down to six players changed my views on having a large amount of foreign players. I decided then to go with the kids and if I could sign English lads I would. I got two sent off in that game and one or two other things happened with players. I also found that with a couple of players that didn't talk English it is very difficult coaching-wise to get them to grasp the fundamentals. If possible I will look for players I sign to speak English, although we are in the process of signing Hao Haidong from China. He has very limited English but is a very experienced player who I don't think you have to tell too many times what you want him to do. There was a time when Scottish football was a good source for players but if you speak to people that look at players up there now it is clear the standard has dropped over the years. You only have to look at the Scotland squad - the talent is not there any longer because they don't invest in their youth development. It is common knowledge we enquired about Liverpool's Neil Mellor, who could now find himself pushed down the pecking order by the arrival of Fernando Morientes from Real Madrid. I think people like Neil are better off getting some games under their belt, but it's difficult because Liverpool are such a great club and he has had opportunities there. He has scored goals there so they rate him highly and it must be difficult for young players to turn their back on that and drop down to the Championship level. Comments are closed for this article.
Anti-tremor mouse stops PC shakes Anti-tremor mouse stops PC shakes A special adaptor that helps people with hand tremors control a computer mouse more easily has been developed. The device uses similar "steady cam" technology found in camcorders to filter out shaking hand movements. People with hand tremors find it hard to use conventional mice for simple computer tasks because of the erratic movements of the cursor on the screen. About three million Britons have some sort of hand tremor condition, said the UK National Tremor Foundation. "Using a computer mouse is well known for being extremely hard for people with tremors so we're delighted to hear that a technology has been developed to address this problem," said Karen Walsh, from the UK National Tremor Foundation. Most commonly associated with tremors is Parkinson's disease, but they can also be caused by other conditions like Essential Tremor (ET). Tremors more often affect older people, but can hit all ages. ET, for example, is genetic and can afflict people throughout their lives. The Assistive Mouse Adapter (AMA) is the brainchild of IBM researcher Jim Levine who developed the prototype after seeing his uncle, who has Parkinson's disease, struggle with mouse control. "I knew that there must be way to improve the situation for him and the millions of other tremor sufferers around the world, including the elderly. "The number of elderly computer users will increase as the population ages, and at the same time, the need for computer access grows," he said. Computer users plug the device into a PC, and it can be adjusted depending on how severe the tremor is. It is also able to recognise multiple clicking on a mouse button caused by shaky digits. IBM said it would partner up with a small UK-based electronics firm, Montrose Secam, to produce the devices which will cost about Â£70. James Cosgrave, one of the company's directors, said it would make a big difference to those with tremors. "I'm a pilot and my tremor condition has not limited my ability to fly a plane," he said. "But using a PC has proven almost impossible simply because everything revolves around using the mouse to accurately manipulate the tiny cursor on the screen." He said a prototype of the gadget had transformed his life. The device could help open up computing to millions more people who have found shaking to be a barrier. Last year, the Office for National Statistics reported that for the first time, more than half of all households in Britain had a home computer. With prices getting cheaper to get online too, computer ownership is increasing. But although 62% of British people have tried the internet, only 15% of Britons aged 65 or over have been online. More than six million UK households now have a broadband net. By the middle of 2005, it is estimated that 50% of all UK net users will be on broadband. There are still millions using the net through dial-up connections too. Return to results
Aviva announces 5.2% rise in its health insurance plans Aviva announces 5.2% rise in its health insurance plans Price increases across range of plans will be effective from the beginning of next year Health insurance with Aviva will cost thousands of families more than â¬ 120 more each year after the company announced premium price increases of an average of 5.2 per cent this morning. Health insurance with Aviva will cost thousands of families more than â¬ 120 more each year after the company announced premium price increases of an average of 5.2 per cent this morning. The price increases across a range of its plans will be effective from the beginning of next year and come just days after Glo Health announced similar increases on its policies. Aviva said it regretted that it has had to impose its latest increase blaming the impact of recent changes in Government policy on public hospital bed charges and the increase in the cost of claims which, it said, had been driven upwards by âthe shift in the age composition of our customer baseâ. Last Friday evening, the Government informed health insurers of its decision not to reduce the rates set out in legislation passed by the Oireachtas last July which allows privately insured patients to be charged for the use of a public bed in a public hospital. This means that from the beginning of January, patients with private health insurance will be charged up to â¬ 813 per night when they occupy a public bed in a public hospital. The current charge is â¬ 75 per night. Aviva said the new charge âdirectly increases the cost of providing cover for our membersâ. Its chief executive Alison Burns claimed the company was âdeeply conscious of the struggle our customers face to maintain their health coverâ and she said it had taken the decision not to increase the price of some of its entry level plans. âThose due to renew in January and February already face premium increases as a result of the governmentâs decision to reduce tax relief. With this in mind, we have held our increase to the absolute minimum of an average of 5.2 per cent.â She added that Aviva would have to keep premium prices under review over the coming months. âRecent government policy changes have severely disrupted the health insurance market and their impact on customer behaviour remains to be seen. Our first obligation as a responsible regulated insurer is to make sure we are in a position to pay the claims of our customers when they get sick,â she stressed. .

Blatter suggests offside change Blatter suggests offside change Fifa president Sepp Blatter has recommended a radical change to football's offside laws. Blatter wants to simplify the current laws which partially rely on the interpretation of assistant referees. "You must make the rule simpler by saying only the player who receives the ball can be offside - there should not be passive offsides anymore," he said. "This means a player without the ball cannot be ruled offside. Purists will scream, but it's a simpler rule." Blatter said he was not in favour of video technology overall, but admitted that Fifa was looking at the possibility of experimenting with goal-line technology to decide if the ball had crossed the line or not. "One thing that is possible, and for which we're looking for an acceptable solution, is the control of the goal-line to find out whether the ball was in or out," said Blatter. The 69-year-old also said he was keen to remain president of football's world governing body until 2011. "Let's first complete the 2006 World Cup. And then, if I'm still in good health, I will still feel like continuing my work at Fifa because I was seriously hampered in my first term. "The first half of my first term (between 1998 and 2002) doesn't count. If national associations tell me to go on, why shouldn't I stand once again?" Return to results

Broadband soars in 2004 Broadband soars in 2004 If broadband were a jumbo jet, then 2003 would have seen it taxiing down the runway, firing up its engines and preparing for take-off. But this year has seen it soar. In the spring it literally took to the skies as Lufthansa and British Airways trialled it on flights. This perhaps said more about how indispensable people were beginning to perceive the technology, rather than how useful sky-high broadband would actually be. It was flying high and by the autumn, five million Britons had signed up for high-speed net access at home. Such enthusiasm is unlikely to dampen any time soon and experts predict that by the end of next year the numbers will have risen to more than eight million, or more than 30% of homes. The two key factors in whetting people's appetite were falling prices and a huge marketing push. When operators such as BT and Telewest offered standard 512K broadband for less than Â£20 at the beginning of the year, it was as if an invisible barrier had been breached - broadband had truly gone mass market. A feeding frenzy followed as firms vied for eyeballs in a price war reminiscent of that following the mass market take-up of dial-up. Broadband for less than Â£10 was even touted by some firms, although such a low price raised eyebrows among more established companies questioning how they are able to sustain such business models. For those who became broadbanders in 2004 there was no turning back and the days of waiting for the modem to kick in began to seem as outdated an idea as a jungle without celebrities. The rest of the world was also falling in love with the benefits of fast internet access, to the tune of 100 million connections worldwide by April, prompting research firm Point Topic to declare it one of the fastest growing technologies ever. By September, the number of broadband connections in the UK finally overtook dial-up and in December BT announced that it was making a new broadband connection every 10 seconds. Broadband was being mentioned on the 10 O'clock News and in the tabloids; the Sun even carried a cartoon joke about it. But two of the most significant pieces of news for broadband were items that did not make the headlines. In May, BT quietly announced that it was shaving 70% off the cost of allowing other operators access to its telephone exchanges, so-called local loop unbundling. The vital local loop is the crucial link between telephone exchanges and homes. At the moment BT has a stranglehold on more than 80% of these lines making it the key voice in deciding what ADSL products get into homes. With cheaper local loop unbundling, rivals to BT can offer faster services that will leave the broadband of today looking positively tortoise-like. It will mean the UK will finally catch up with countries such as France and the Netherlands, where homes are routinely enjoying speeds of up to 15Mb (megabits per second). And the major price fall means that, rather than just talk about it, companies are actually starting to get their own equipment into BT's exchanges. It may not seem that exciting but it is a remarkable transition given that just a few years ago the arguments over local loop unbundling bore more than a passing resemblance to the Northern Ireland peace talks - fraught, bitter and with no end in sight. Another big piece of news for broadband users in 2004 was the extension of BT's reach, meaning more than 95% of the population could get broadband, regardless of how far away from the exchange they lived. There was a slight caveat for those wanting to upgrade to 1Mbps broadband, they still have to live within six kilometres of a broadband-enabled exchange. For thousands frustrated by their inability to get the technology, the news meant they could finally join in. Broadband is not just about fast access over the telephone and cable operators NTL and Telewest also had a bumper year. The biggest news for them was increased speeds, introducing 2Mb and 3Mb services for users and offering a free upgrade to those on 512K. The cable operators are limited in their reach and it is perhaps testament to how big a deal local loop unbundling could become that even they are considering extending their range via this route. Broadband can seem confusing for consumers, with the huge amount of operators offering so many different products, some with capped bandwidth and different length contracts and set-up fees. It is unlikely to get any less easy to understand in 2005 but remains a plane worth catching. As it gets faster and offers extras such as cheap telephone calls online, the only real thing to remember for the coming year is to enjoy the ride. Return to results
Businessman and ex-HSE chairman appointed to Dublin Midlands group Businessman and ex-HSE chairman appointed to Dublin Midlands group Dr Frank Dolphin has been appointed as the head of the Dublin Midlands Hospital Group. Photograph: Bryan OâBrien / The Online News Tallaght Hospital board has welcomed the appointment of former Health Service Executive chairman Dr Frank Dolphin as the head of its new six-hospital group. Dr Dolphinâs appointment as chairman of the Dublin Midlands Hospital Group was announced on Friday by Minister for Health James Reilly . The businessman stepped down as chairman of the HSE in 2011. Last year he headed up a review group to assess possible locations for the national childrenâs hospital. He is also chairman of the strategic advisory group on the childrenâs hospital project. He is established company Rigney Dolphin in 1990. Under health reform plans announced in May Dr Reilly, hospitals across the State were divided into six groups. The Dublin Midlands Hospital Group comprises St Jamesâs Hospital; Tallaght Hospital; Midlands Regional Hospital, Tullamore; Naas General Hospital; Midlands Regional Hospital Portlaoise and the Coombe Women and Infants Hospital and academic partner Trinity College Dublin In a statement Tallaght Hospital board said it âlooks forward to working with Dr Dolphin in establishing this hospital groupâ Welcoming the appointment on Friday last, Dr Reilly said that it was âanother key step in the transformation of our hospital services whereby hospitals will no longer work in isolation from each other but will provide services to patients as part of a network.â Dr Reilly is expected to announce shortly the appointment of chairpersons to Dublin North East and South/South West hospital groups. The heads of the new groups of hospitals should be paid â¬136,282, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has determined. Return to results
Capital gains tax reliefs extended for property investors, entrepreneurs and farmers Capital gains tax reliefs extended for property investors, entrepreneurs and farmers Deposit interest retention tax (DIRT) is set to rise to 41 per cent from January 1st 2014, yielding the Government an additional â¬140 million in annual tax revenues. The increased rate will also apply to the exit tax that is levied on life assurance policies and investment funds, and the higher rate applies to payments made both annually, and less frequently. Previously, a rate of 33 per cent was levied on payments made annually or more frequently, and 36 per cent on less frequent payments. The rate of DIRT has now more than doubled since 2008, when it was 21 per cent. Prior to Budget 2014, it had been speculated the Government would impose PRSI on forms of unearned income - such as rental income, dividends and interest - but instead it appears to have opted to substantially increase the rate of DIRT. The move will see the Governmentâs take of every â¬1 earned in interest rise to 41 cent. Under the new rate, a deposit account valued at â¬ 50,000 and earning interest at 3 per cent will now only return â¬885 to an investor, with â¬615 going to the Exchequer. In his speech, Minister for Finance Michael Noonan said the measure will âincentivise investment and spending in the economy, which is vital for the creation of jobsâ. The rate of capital gains tax (CGT), at 33 per cent was left unchanged, and a number of reliefs introduced. CGT relief for property investors has also been extended, with those purchasing a property before December 31st, 2014 exempt from the tax, provided that they hold the property for seven years. Jonathan Hillyer, managing partner at HWBC said the extension of the waiver âwill help strengthen investor confidenceâ. Secondly, a new CGT incentive will be introduced to encourage entrepreneurs, in particular serial entrepreneurs who make several investments, to invest and re-invest in assets used in new productive trading activities in order to encourage new business creation and employment. If an entrepreneur has already paid CGT on the disposal of their assets, and they invest in a new company or companies from January 1st, 2014 to December 31st, 2018, they may qualify for a lower rate of CGT if they hold the investment for at least three years. The CGT rate applicable will be reduced by the lower of: a) the CGT paid by the individual on a previous disposal of assets from1 January 1st, 2010; and b) 50 per cent of the CGT due on the disposal of the new investment. This measure will require EU State Aid approval before it can be implemented. Thirdly, the Minister announced that CGT retirement relief will be extended further to encourage older farmers who have no children to whom to transfer their farm to lease their farms to younger farmers. The relief applies to disposals of leased land, where the land is leased for a minimum lease of five years, and the subsequent disposal is to a person other than a child of the individual disposing of the farmland.

Centre will provide research data for the Stormont executive Centre will provide research data for the Stormont executive Arlene Foster, Enterprise, Trade and Investment Minister, described the centre as âa joined up solution to delivering independent policy researchâ. Stormontâs Minister for Enterprise Arlene Foster has welcomed the establishment of the Northern Ireland Centre for Economic Policy (Nicep), which was officially launched in Belfast last night. The centre is based at the Ulster Business School and is sponsored by Mrs Fosterâs department,First Trust Bank and Belfast Harbour Commissioners. Headed by the University of Ulsterâs Prof Neil Gibson and supported by associate directors Richard Johnston and Gareth Hetherington , the centre will provide research data for the Stormont executive. University of Ulster academics, principally vice chancellor Richard Barnett , have already been to the fore in carrying out research and policy analysis for ministers and senior civil servants. Policy analysis In addition to conducting research and providing analysis and policy advice, the body will also engage with other organisations that have an interest in helping the North achieve its economic potential. âThis focus on the economy demands robust, policy-orientated economic research to ensure we make the right decisions,â said Mrs Foster. âI believe that Nicep has a vital role to play in helping to provide this.â She described the centre as âa joined up solution to delivering independent policy researchâ. âI look forward to seeing the centre working closely with my department as we continue to rebuild and rebalance our economy,â Mrs Foster said. âNot only are we emerging from the deepest recession on record, we are also looking to grow the private sector through our economic strategy and secure the best result for Northern Ireland in areas such as corporation tax .â âWorld-classâ Prof Barnett said it was vital that the University of Ulster conduct world-class research that would feed into the policy-making process. âWith the establishment of Nicep [we] are looking to do our part in transforming the economic landscape of a region that has, for far too long, looked to others to solve its problems,â he said. Nicep director and professor of economic policy Neil Gibson said the development of new policy was integral âto accelerate any recovery and prepare for future challengesâ. Nicep forecasts âmodest growthâ of 0.7 per cent this year, increasing to 1.5 per cent in 2014 which equates to 6,000 net new jobs and a further 12,000 next year.

Change may indicate tide turning for small business Change may indicate tide turning for small business Christmas parties are back in fashion according to a new business barometer. Public Affairs Correspondent The number of small firms who plan to hold staff Christmas parties this year has risen significantly in comparison to 2012, according to the latest business barometer. The quarterly survey revealed that 46 per cent of Irish SME owners will host a festive party for staff this year, an increase of 10 per cent on this time last year. The Business Barometer, an opinion poll of SME owners across the UK and Ireland, also found that 16 per cent of Irish firms are benefiting from current trading conditions, a rise of over 6 per cent on the previous quarter, suggesting that business confidence is improving. âChristmas parties have fallen victim to the recession over the last few years and this noticeable increase is a positive sign that business confidence is picking up,â said Close Brothers Commercial Finance (Ireland) managing director, Harry Parkinson . âFor many bosses, the annual Christmas party is significant as it is a chance to build relationships with staff and reward them for their hard work and loyalty throughout the year.â Over recent years many employers cut back on the party as part of their efforts to cut cost. As staff morale can make a real difference to a companyâs bottom line, he said, it was great to see so many employers intending to treat their staff with a festive party this year. He also said the development was a potential indication that the tide may be turning for Irish SMEs. Comments are closed for this article.
Chelsea ridiculed over complaint Chelsea ridiculed over complaint Barcelona assistant coach Henk Ten Cate has branded Chelsea's expected complaint to Uefa as "pathetic". The Blues are poised to complain about an alleged half-time incident during Wednesday's 2-1 loss at the Nou Camp. The source of Chelsea's anger was an alleged talk between Barca boss Frank Rijkaard and referee Anders Frisk, who later dismissed Didier Drogba. "To react the way Chelsea have is pathetic. Mourinho lied with the line-ups, and now this," Ten Cate said. Uefa has said its own tunnel representative witnessed nothing unusual out of the ordinary during the half-time break. Spokesman William Gaillard said: "Frisk says Rijkaard greeted him and apologised he had not had the opportunity to say hello before the game. "We had two Uefa officials there and neither witnessed it. The referee's dressing room was locked and he and his assistants were the only people allowed in." Indeed, it is the Londoners who could be on the receiving end of any punishment after failing to turn up for the compulsory press conference after the defeat. Uefa delegate Thomas Giordano added: "The only unusual thing that happened as far as we are concerned is that Chelsea failed to present themselves in the press conference." The referee is not expected to include any of the alleged incidents in his report to Uefa - weakening Chelsea's case. Rijkaard was critical of Mourinho's decision not to speak to the media after the match. "There was a lot of talking before the game and now surprisingly there is a lot of talking after the game. It is not good behaviour after a match," he said. "Maybe they want to start something and make it worse than than it is. I really don't understand it. I am very calm about it." Barca midfielder Deco, formerly managed by Mourinho at Porto, agreed that it was not typical of his fellow Portuguese to lodge a protest. "It's not normal behaviour on his part. It was not logical he did not give a news conference," he said. Rijkaard added: "Chelsea is the team which has conceded fewest goals in the English league and they defend very well so I am very pleased with the win. "My men deserved victory and I am pleased to have won this match. I congratulate my players." Return to results
Children getting more sleep consume less calories and lose weight Children getting more sleep consume less calories and lose weight The research found that children consumed an average of 134 less calories a day when they got an early night. Photograph: Bryan OâBrien/The Online News. Putting children to bed earlier may be a simple way to keep their weight down, research has shown. Childhood obesity is not only caused by fast food, sugary drinks and lack of exercise, the new findings suggest. Lack of sleep also appears to be an important factor. Scientists made the discovery after adjusting the sleep patterns of 37 children aged eight to 11, more than a quarter of whom were overweight or obese. When children increased their sleep, they reported consuming an average 134 fewer calories per day and lost half a pound in weight. Tests showed they had lower fasting levels of the hunger-regulating hormone leptin. âFindings from this study suggest that enhancing school-age childrenâs sleep at night could have important implications for prevention and treatment of obesity,â said Dr Chantelle Hart, from Temple University in Philadelphia . âThe potential role of sleep should be further explored.â The findings are published in the journal Pediatrics. Dr Hart is now working on a follow-up study to determine whether increased sleep produces significant changes in eating patterns, activity, and weight. âGiven all of its documented benefits, in many ways, you canât lose in promoting a good nightâs sleep,â she added. - PA Comments are closed for this article.
China 'blocks Google news site' China 'blocks Google news site' China has been accused of blocking access to Google News by the media watchdog, Reporters Without Borders. The Paris-based pressure group said the English-language news site had been unavailable for the past 10 days. It said the aim was to force people to use a Chinese edition of the site which, according to the watchdog, does not include critical reports. Google told the Online News News website it was aware of the problems and was investigating the causes. China is believed to extend greater censorship over the net than any other country in the world. A net police force monitors websites and e-mails, and controls on gateways connecting the country to the global internet are designed to prevent access to critical information. Popular Chinese portals such as Sina.com and Sohu.com maintain a close eye on content and delete politically sensitive comments. And all 110,000 net cafes in the country have to use software to control access to websites considered harmful or subversive. "China is censoring Google News to force internet users to use the Chinese version of the site which has been purged of the most critical news reports," said the group in a statement. "By agreeing to launch a news service that excludes publications disliked by the government, Google has let itself be used by Beijing," it said. For its part, the search giant said it was looking into the issue. "It appears that many users in China are having difficulty accessing Google News sites in China and we are working to understand and resolve the issue," said a Google spokesperson. Google News gathers information from some 4,500 news sources. Headlines are selected for display entirely by a computer algorithm, with no human editorial intervention. It offers 15 editions of the service, including one tailored for China and one for Hong Kong. Google launched a version in simplified Chinese in September. The site does not filter news results to remove politically sensitive information. But Google does not link to news sources which are inaccessible from within China as this would result in broken links. Comments are closed for this article.
Commodore finds new lease of life Commodore finds new lease of life The once-famous Commodore computer brand could be resurrected after being bought by a US-based digital music distributor. New owner Yeahronimo Media Ventures has not ruled out the possibility of a new breed of Commodore computers. It also plans to develop a "worldwide entertainment concept" with the brand, although details are not yet known. The groundbreaking Commodore 64 computer elicits fond memories for those who owned one back in the 1980s. In the chronology of home computing, Commodore was one of the pioneers. The Commodore 64, launched in 1982, was one of the first affordable home PCs. It was followed a few years later by the Amiga. The Commodore 64 sold more than any other single computer system, even to this day. The brand languished somewhat in the 1990s. Commodore International filed for bankruptcy in 1994 and was sold to Dutch firm Tulip Computers. In the late 1980s the firm was a great rival to Atari, which produced its own range of home computers and is now a brand of video games, formerly known as Infogrames. Tulip Computers sold several products under the Commodore name, including portable USB storage devices and digital music players. It had planned to relaunch the brand, following an upsurge of nostalgia for 1980s-era games. Commodore 64 enthusiasts have written emulators for Windows PC, Apple Mac and even PDAs so that the original Commodore games can be still run. The sale of Commodore is expected to be complete in three weeks in a deal worth over Â£17m. Return to results
Company reduced its overseas tax rate to about 5 per cent Company reduced its overseas tax rate to about 5 per cent The Google company logo sits at their European headquarters in Barrow Street, Dublin. Google funnelled â¬8.8 billion of royalty payments to Bermuda last year, a quarter more than in 2011, underlining the rapid expansion of a strategy that has saved the US internet group billions of dollars in tax. By routing royalty payments to Bermuda, Google reduces its overseas tax rate to about 5 per cent, less than half the rate in Ireland , where it books most of its international sales. The figures were revealed in the latest filings by one of Googleâs Dutch subsidiaries, and means that royalty payments made to Bermuda have doubled over the past three years. It also routes the profits through the Netherlands to avoid withholding taxes, using a structure known as a Dutch sandwich. Google declined to comment. â Comments are closed for this article.
Conference to examine Irelandâs changed legal landscape following blanket bank guarantee Conference to examine Irelandâs changed legal landscape following blanket bank guarantee The chairman of the Global Cork Economic Forum, John Mullins (left), outside St Paulâs Cathedral in London, inviting London-based Cork native Nick Howard of Amarenco Solar to the Global Cork Economic Forum The inaugural Global Cork Economic Forum is taking place in Cork this Thursday, as part of the flagship Cork Gathering event Rebel Week. Greencore chief executive Patrick Coveney, Vodafone chief executive Anne OâLeary, Glen Dimplex chairman SeÃ¡n OâDriscoll, INM chairman Leslie Buckley and Tesco Ireland managing director Tony Keohane will be among the speakers. Lord David Puttnam will give talk about the digital age and the future of the Irish and Cork economy. Forum chairman John Mullins said the aim was âto focus on ideas that will benefit the region so that we can create jobs for those who live here or those who would like to return.â Irelandâs changed legal landscape, five years after the blanket guarantee was given to Irish banks, will be examined at a conference in Dublin this week. The conference, which is being held in Griffith College on Friday, will see Mr Justice Frank Clarke of the Supreme Court give the keynote address, with other speakers including Minister of State Brian Hayes, master of the High Court Edmund Honohan and former Law Reform Commissioner, Patricia Rickard-Clarke. âWith the legal landscape in commercial law in a state of flux since 2008, this conference will address the corporate and financial governance issues which have arisen from the bust, personal insolvency cases and legislation, and corporate insolvency law in examinership, receivership and liquidation cases,â organiser and Griffith College lecturer Dr Claire Hogan said.

Photograph: Eric Luke/The Online News The Government has appointed a judge to examine the feasibility of a compensation scheme for women who underwent symphysiotomies, a controversial childbirth procedure. Of the estimated 1,500 women who underwent the procedure between the 1940s and 1980s, it is estimated that up to 300 survivors remain. Symphysiotomies involved sawing a pregnant womanâs pubic bone in half to widen the birth canal. For many women the procedure left permanent injuries such as incontinence, difficulties walking and chronic pain. Minister for Health Dr James Reilly today announced that Judge Yvonne Murphy has been appointed to examine how such a scheme could be structured. She has been asked to draw up a series of recommendations by next February to âassist in finding closureâ for women affected by the operation. The Government has agreed to contribute to an ex gratia scheme, if she recommends one. Judge Murphy - who headed up the commission into the Dublin Archdioceseâs handling of child abuse allegations - is also due to meet with insurers, indemnifiers and other third parties to explore whether they will contribute towards such a fund. Dr Reilly said he hoped the appointment would hopefully bring closure for these women for the years of suffering they have endured. âI have listened closely to the testimony provided by the woman and I cannot help but be moved by their stories,â he said. âI am determined that their situation will now be addressed, having been ignored for so long by previous governments.â However he announced a U-turn on the Governmentâs plans to pass legislation which would allow women affected by the procedure to seek legal redress. Dr Reilly had previously said the Government would not oppose a cross-party Private Membersâ Bill which would lift the statute of limitations for up to 200 affected women. At the press conference today, he said legal advice given to the Government indicated that such a move could result in legal challenges by insurance firms on the basis that the State had âmoved the goalpostsâ over cover. Reaction to the announcement has been mixed today. One of the support groups, Survivors of Symphysiotomy Ltd, welcomed the Government decision which it said was relief for many women who have been battling for justice for decades. Tom Moran , chairman of SOS Ltd, said: âWe welcome this decision to appoint the judge to we hope it lead to women finally being given a chance of some kind of closure.â But Sinn FÃ©inâs health spokesman CaoimhghÃ­n Ã CaolÃ¡in said the announcement did not offer truth or justice, and criticised plans to keep the statute of limitations in place. âThe type of scheme outlined in the terms of reference offers the women no prospect of adequate compensation for what was so barbarically done to them nor the choice to pursue their rights in the courts.â A report commissioned by the Government last year found that use of symphysiotomies was at its peak in Ireland when it had declined in the rest of Europe . The use of the procedure was concentrated in a handful of hospitals, according to the report. These include Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda (348), the National Maternity Hospital (281) and the Coombe in Dublin (242). The use of symphysiotomy began to decline from the late 1950s as a result of increased confidence in the safety of repeated Caesarean sections. However, Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital continued with the procedure until 1984. It found that while some obstetricians heralded the operation as a solution to difficulties in labour, others described it as âmidwifery of the dark agesâ and a âbrutalâ form of surgery due to its long-term health effects.
Corporation tax has diminished significantly since the boom, peaking at â¬6.7 billion in 2006 Corporation tax has diminished significantly since the boom, peaking at â¬6.7 billion in 2006 The topic of corporation tax is hard to avoid these days: who pays it, who doesnât, and should companies be paying more? As the debate continues to rage on both sides of the Atlantic about the rights and wrongs of multinationalâs tax practices, we look at how much tax Irelandâs Top 1,000 companies are paying. A diminishing contributor Given the challenging economic environment, itâs no surprise to see that corporation tax has diminished significantly since the boom. In 2006, it peaked at â¬ 6.7 billion on the back of soaring profits, but it has been falling since, hitting a trough of â¬3.5 billion in 2011 before recovering somewhat last year. Of more significance perhaps, is the degree to which it contributes to the Governmentâs coffers, as the sharp rise in income tax in recent years means that the economy has become increasingly dependent on individuals. In 2003, corporation tax accounted for 15 per cent of total tax revenues, which meant that â¬1 in every â¬7 of tax generated came from corporation tax. Since then it has declined in importance, with corporation tax accounting for as little as â¬1 in every â¬10 of tax revenue in 2011, and â¬1 in every â¬9 last year. Ireland is not alone in shifting the tax burden away from corporations and on to individuals. In the US, for example, corporate taxes, as a percentage of total federal tax revenue, have fallen to 9 per cent from more than 30 per cent in the 1950s. Who pays tax at 12.5 per cent? As the survey clearly illustrates, while a number of Irish-based companies, including Ryanair and Paypal, pay tax at 12.5 per cent, Irelandâs headline corporation tax rate is more an initial indicator of the tax a company must pay than a hard-and-fast figure. Indeed this survey shows that Irelandâs largest companies often pay tax at a rate of more - and less - than 12.5 per cent. And Ireland is not the only country where the effective rate differs from the headline rate. France, for example, has a headline rate of 33.33 per cent but an effective rate of 8.2 per cent, while Germany has a statutory rate of 30-33 per cent, but the effective rate is lower, at 18.9 per cent. A recent study by the US Government Accountability Office found that large US corporations paid an average of 12.6 per cent tax on their profits, far below the nominal US rate of 35 per cent. Where a company has a higher-than-expected tax rate, it may be due to the inclusion of nontrading items that could distort the tax figures. Where it is lower, it may be due to complex arrangements, or simply because a company has carried forward its losses from previous years, which can be used to offset a tax bill. The multinationals who do pay tax While multinationals may be making the headlines globally due to dubious tax practices, it seems that some are nonetheless paying considerable rates in Ireland. The online retailer Amazon, for example, has been top of the debate in the UK, but the survey shows that its Irish operation paid taxes of almost â¬3 million on profits of â¬ 6.9 million in the year to December 2012. This corresponds to an effective rate of 43 per cent, and itâs not a once-off. In 2011, Amazon paid corporation tax at a rate of 29 per cent and at almost 40 per cent in 2010. Google also pays one of the highest tax rates in Ireland. In 2011, it paid an effective rate of 91 per cent, due in part to a â¬ 12 million foreign withholding-tax charge.

Costs for medical malpractice and clinical negligence could reach â¬970 million Costs for medical malpractice and clinical negligence could reach â¬970 million Time taken to resolve some claims more than doubled over four years since 2008 The State is facing a potential bill of â¬970 million for clinical indemnity claims against hospitals and medical practitioners in 2012, the C&AG has said The State is facing a potential bill of â¬970 million for clinical indemnity claims against hospitals and medical practitioners in 2012, the C&AG has said. The figure has more than doubled since 2008 when the liability was â¬449 million. The clinical indemnity scheme was established in July 2002 and covers all areas of medical malpractice and clinical negligence arising from the diagnosis, treatment and care of patients taken against public healthcare and practitioners. Consultants have been covered since February 2004. The scheme is administered by the State Claims Agency . The average time taken to resolve claims has also increased, with the average time to resolve mental health claims rising from 2.2 years in 2008 to 4.8 years in 2012. The report found if the recent trend in demand continues, it is likely the time taken to resolve cases will rise further unless the agency can increase its annual output. Some 20 per cent of claims were obstetric-related, but these represented more than half the bill âdue to the high settlement values associated with cerebral palsy cases and other serious birth-related claimsâ, the report said. Of the 833 new claims made in 2012, 230 related to hip replacement procedures carried out using implants from De Puy Orthopaedics. The agency reached an agreement with De Puy that the company would provide indemnity for âmost of the casesâ, the report said. More than 50 per cent of claims last year were resolved by negotiating a settlement, the report found, compared to 25 per cent in 2008. Over the same period, the proportion of claims resolved at no cost to the State Claims Agency declined significantly, the report said. Less than 3 per cent of claims were resolved by the courts last year. The cases that do go to court are generally those involving infant cerebral palsy or other catastrophic injuries. There were more than 80,000 adverse clinical incidents, causing injury or adverse effects for patients, reported to the agency in 2012. More than a third related to falls, 13 per cent related to violence or abuse, 8 per cent were medication errors and 7 per cent were peri-natal. Some 6 per cent related to treatment given and 32 per cent were categorised as âotherâ. Return to results
Country âcomplacent in prosperityâ, Dublin event hears Country âcomplacent in prosperityâ, Dublin event hears Surfers carrying their boards walk past two women sunbathing and a sign warning swimmers of dangerous surf conditions on an autumn day at Sydneyâs Manly Beach today. Photograph: David Gray/Online News After 22 years of unbroken prosperity, Australia now faces âserious economic challengesâ, the inaugural Australia Lecture in Dublin heard last night. At the same time, Australia, which traditionally backs the US in military conflict, now finds its political relationships with the rest of the world have become more complicated, political journalist Paul Kelly , editor-at-large of the national broadsheet The Australian, said. The country had become âcomplacent in prosperityâ and must adjust to life after the âepic eventâ of its mining boom, he said. As Chinaâs exceptional growth rate slows, a âthreat of recessionâ hovers over the new Liberal government led by Tony Abbott. âFor the first time our major trading partner is not a strategic ally,â he noted, adding that a âcentral testâ of its foreign policy would be to âensure we never have to chooseâ between the US and China. Australians are pragmatists who prize âtheir British heritage, Irish spirit, multicultural society, trade with Asia and links to the USâ and âthey donât see why they canât have the lotâ, he told the audience at the Royal Irish Academy. Mr Kelly âs next book will cover the six years of the âtroubled and dividedâ Labor government that held office for two terms from 2007 until September of this year under the leadership of Kevin Rudd , then Julia Gillard , then Kevin Rudd again. The Labor government provides an âanti-modelâ for Mr Abbott, a conservative in the John Howard mould. The Australian media does not have the power to decide elections, but merely âaccentuatesâ trends in the public mood, said Mr Kelly, whose newspaper is owned by Rupert Murdochâs News Corp Australia. The event was organised by UCDâs Australia Studies Centre and Mr Kellyâs visit to Ireland was funded by the Australian government. The Australians and the Irish âinvariably get on well together when they meetâ, said Mr Kelly, who is of Irish descent. .

Crumlin reiterates support for childrenâs hospital site Crumlin reiterates support for childrenâs hospital site Chief executive says support for St Jamesâs campus location âremains unchangedâ The development of the national childrenâs hospital is earmarked for a site at the west end of St Jamesâs Hospital in Dublin. Photograph: Bryan OâBrien Our Ladyâs Childrenâs Hospital in Crumlin has reiterated its âcategoricalâ support for locating the new national childrenâs hospital at St Jamesâs Hospital. Chief executive Lorcan Birthistle said the hospital informed the Government in April last year that its board unanimously supported the location of the new hospital on the St Jamesâs campus and âthis position remains unchangedâ. Mr Birthistle was responding to recent media coverage of the issue, including a call by An Taisce to extend the campus of St Jamesâs to include the Coombe Womenâs Hospital and to relocate the project from St Jamesâs to land adjacent to the Coombe. This would mean the hospital was co-located with a childrenâs hospital, in line with best international practice. Dr Orla Franklin , a consultant paediatric cardiologist at Crumlin, has also expressed reservation about the failure to co-locate the childrenâs hospital with a maternity hospital, given the need for very sick newborns to receive immediate treatment in a childrenâs hospital. Mr Birthistle said in a statement issued this morning: âWe look forward to working with the Childrenâs Hospital Group Board and the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board in developing this very important project on the St Jamesâs campus.â Comments are closed for this article.
Disney backs Sony DVD technology Disney backs Sony DVD technology A next generation DVD technology backed by Sony has received a major boost. Film giant Disney says it will produce its future DVDs using Sony's Blu-ray Disc technology, but has not ruled out a rival format developed by Toshiba. The two competing DVD formats, Blu-ray developed by Sony and others, and Toshiba's HD-DVD, have been courting top film studios for several months. The next generation of DVDs promises very high quality pictures and sound, as well as a lot of data. Both technologies use a blue laser to write information. It has a shorter wavelength so more data can be stored. Disney is the latest studio to announce which technology it is backing in a format battle which mirrors the 1980s Betamax versus VHS war. Sony lost out to JVC in that fight. The current battle for Hollywood's hearts and minds is a crucial one because high-definition films will bring in billions of revenue and the studios would prefer to use one standard. Last month, Paramount, Universal and Warner Brothers said they were opting for the Toshiba and NEC-backed format, HD-DVD high-definition discs. Those studios currently produce about 45% of DVD content. Sony Pictures Entertainment and MGM Studios have already staked their allegiance with the Blu-ray Disc Association, whose members also include technology companies Dell, Samsung and Matsushita. Twentieth Century Fox is still to announce which technology it will be supporting. If Fox decided to go with Blu-ray too, it would mean the format would have a 47% share of DVD content. Disney said its films would be available on the Blu-ray format when DVD players for the standard went on sale on North America and Japan, expected in 2006. Universal is to start producing films on the HD-DVD format in 2005, and Paramount will start releasing titles using the standard in 2006. Toshiba expects sales of HD-DVDs to reach 300bn yen ($2.9bn, Â£1.5bn) by 2010. Return to results

Dundee Utd 4-1 Aberdeen Dundee Utd 4-1 Aberdeen Dundee United eased into the semi-final of the Scottish Cup with an emphatic win over Aberdeen. Alan Archibald prodded United ahead in 19 minutes and James Grady made it two from close range 10 minutes later. Richie Byrne's header gave Aberdeen a way back into the game, but Stevie Crawford restored United's lead from 18 yards before half time. The scoring was completed by Grady just after the break - a superb shot on the turn making it 4-1. Tony Bullock in the United goal was called into action for the first time with just over a quarter-of-an-hour on the clock. Noel Whelan laid the ball off to Jamie Winter on the edge of the box, but his first-time effort was gathered by the United keeper. Moments later though, the home side took the lead. Barry Robson whipped in a free kick from the right, which Stevie Crawford caught on the volley. Russell Anderson failed to deal with it and Whelan's clearance off the line landed kindly at the feet of Archibald, who poked the ball into the net. United doubled their lead after 29 minutes when Grady tapped the ball into an empty net after Robson had headed Mark Wilson's cross off the angle of post and bar. But only three minutes later Aberdeen clawed their way back into the match. A free kick from the left by Winter was met powerfully by the head of Byrne at the back post, leaving Bullock helpless. United restored their two-goal lead four minutes before the end of a highly entertaining first half. Jason Scotland played a perfectly-weighted pass into the path of the onrushing Crawford and he coolly beat Ryan Esson from 18 yards. United ended the game as a contest just two minutes after the interval. Grady received a pass from Crawford with his back to goal on the edge of the box and after taking one touch, he spun to volley the ball past the despairing dive of Esson. The home side were in complete control and it required a good stop from Esson to keep out Robson's drive after 62 minutes. The keeper denied the same player again 10 minutes later, beating away his fierce shot from the left of the penalty area. Robson saw another long-range effort tipped round the post before a cute lob was headed off the line.

ECB financial supervisor job likely to go to a woman ECB financial supervisor job likely to go to a woman Daniele Nouy of the Bank of France is the leading candidate ahead of todayâs application deadline Daniele Nouy has worked at the Bank of France since 1974, was elected in 2006 as president of the Committee of European Banking Supervisors -- the predecessor of the European Banking Authority -- and is currently the secretary-general of the French Prudential Control Supervisory Authority. Photographer: Mark H. Milstein/ Online News News. Last-minute resumes sent to Mario Draghi for the European Central Bankâs new financial supervisor job are unlikely to feature many men. Ten months after Yves Mersch joined the ECBâs board in the wake of an outcry that its top management would become an all- male club, the next senior appointment needs to be a woman, said four euro-zone central bank officials. The leading candidate is Daniele Nouy of the Bank of France, with resumes to manage the repair job on the euro regionâs crisis-ravaged financial system and supervise its 130 biggest lenders set to arrive at the ECB presidentâs Frankfurt office with postmarks of no later than today. With memories of last yearâs gender tussle coloring the race, European Parliament lawmakers say theyâre ready for another clash if they donât get their way. âItâs almost a certainty that if a very good woman is put forward, all else being equal, the parliament will choose her,â said Sharon Bowles , chairwoman of the parliamentâs Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee, who led protests over Merschâs appointment last year and expects to scrutinise the ECBâs selection. âThere are several in France, so weâre not short, and there are some in other countries.â The ECBâs September 27th ad for the position of chair of the supervisory board called for candidates with âoutstanding expertise in the supervision of financial institutions and the regulation of financial markets.â Officials including Luxembourg Prime Minister Jean-Claude Juncker previously identified Nouy, 63, as a leading candidate. She has worked at the Bank of France since 1974, was elected in 2006 as president of the Committee of European Banking Supervisors -- the predecessor of the European Banking Authority -- and is currently the secretary-general of the French Prudential Control Supervisory Authority. Nouy is âan obvious choice, and it suits their gender balance issue,â said Karel Lannoo, an analyst at the Centre for European Policy Studies, a Brussels-based research group. âNow that Janet Yellenâs been appointed to the Fed they will feel themselves even more stimulated to have much more of a gender balance.â Yellen this month won the race to replace Ben S Bernanke, becoming the first woman to lead the Federal Reserve. Other women appointed to top central bank jobs this year include Elvira Nabiullina, who was named in June as Russiaâs central bank chief. Yesterday, acting Bank of Israel Governor Karnit Flug was nominated for its top position. Nouy may not face competition for the ECB job from two possible German rivals. Bundesbank vice president Sabine Lautenschlaeger, whom ECB board member Peter Praet said a year ago that he holds âin very high regardâ for the role, wonât be available, according to a person with knowledge of her plans. Elke Koenig , who leads the regulator, Bafin, is unavailable, two people with knowledge of her plans said. Even so, other candidates could emerge. All European Union citizens are eligible to apply, opening the race to possible contenders from non-euro area countries, such as Swedish Riksbank deputy governor Kerstin af Jochnick or Ingrid Bonde, the former chief of the countryâs regulator. A Swede could offer the aura of a country with a well-capitalised banking system, untainted by association to any particular euro-area national interest when called upon to act as an umpire. âThereâs a lot of rummaging around in the supervisory authorities to find suitable candidates,â Bowles said. âObviously we are not going to have an all-woman shortlist -- well I doubt it -- although it would be interesting if we did.â Comments are closed for this article.
ECB should buy euro zone assets - OECD ECB should buy euro zone assets - OECD Inflation in the 17-nation euro zone fell to its lowest in nearly four years in October The headquarters of the European Central Bank. The OECD has called on the ECB to buy euro zone assets to help avoid a Japanese-style deflationary spiral. Photo: Online News The European Central Bank must consider buying government and corporate bonds to help the euro zone avoid a Japanese-style deflationary spiral, the OECD said today. It was a direct call for the ECB to undertake quantitative easing, a policy that currently divides the bank, in the face of what the think-tank said was a risk of deflation. Inflation in the 17-nation euro zone fell to its lowest in nearly four years in October, with the economy struggling to recover strongly after emerging from its longest ever recession. Despite a surprise ECB rate cut this month, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development said in its latest economic outlook that the bank needs to take bolder measures at a time of massive unemployment and difficult credit. âRisks of deflation may be slowly increasing,â OECD chief economist Pier Carlo Padoan told Online News. âThe ECB must be very careful and be prepared to use even non-conventional measures to beat any risk of deflation becoming permanent,â he said. Under its statutes, the ECB is banned from buying bonds directly from governments but can find ways to purchase them from banks, for example, on the secondary market or accept them as security in return for finance. The euro zone is still far from the deflation that Japan suffered from the early 1990s, when falling prices weakened demand, leading to wage cuts and even lower prices. But Ireland, Cyprus and Greece all registered deflation in October and for the euro zone as a whole, consumer prices actually fell in October from September, by 0.1 percent. The OECDâs call follows comments by ECB executive board member Peter Praet in an interview this month that asset purchases were one of the tools available to the central bank beyond interest rate cuts. The comments signalled that the ECB, having cut rates so low and provided liquidity to banks, may be considering the controversial move of asset purchases because it has few other options, although it is not clear if that would emulate the US-style quantitative easing programme. The ECB injected more than â¬1 trillion into the banking system via ultra-cheap three-year loans in December 2011 and February 2012. The ECB has run its own bond purchases programmes in the past but has always withdrawn an equivalent amount of money from markets - in effect not printing new money - to ensure its interventions have no impact on the money supply for fear of pushing up the rate of inflation. With inflation at 0.7 per cent in October and well below the ECBâs target of just below 2 per cent, that argument has been greatly weakened. The OECD painted a sobering picture in its outlook for the euro zone as the bloc tries to recover from the public debt and banking crises that nearly shattered the currency area. Economic output is set to grow just 1 per cent next year after contracting 0.4 per cent in 2013, while the unemployment rate will not fall until 2015, the OECD said, putting its forecasts largely in line with the European Commission . However, the OECD sees annual inflation at 1.2 per cent in 2014 and 2015, below the Commissionâs latest forecasts of 1.4 per cent and 1.5 per cent respectively.

Economics was never this interesting when I was at school. Economics was never this interesting when I was at school. The line-up has been released for next monthâs Kilkenomics festival, a four-day economics think-in in Kilkenny organised by David McWilliams. Itâs sort of a cross between Davos and Oxegen, with a plethora of separate events and discussions in theatres and pubs across the city. Thereâll be drinking too. The big draw will surely be Dan Ariely , the top US behavioural economist and Wall Street Journal writer. He appears to be pencilled in for several of the panel discussions, and will also deliver the Raymond Crotty economic lecture. The festival organisers describe Ariely as the WSJâs economic âagony auntâ. I wonder did he get many letters from Ireland during the crisis? âDear Dan. Nobody loves us anymore. What should we do?..... yours in hope, MN, Limerick.â One of the most intriguing-sounding events is a discussion on the Saturday evening in Cleereâs pub and theatre about the provenance and accuracy of economic forecasts. It is called âPulling it Out of Our Arse?â, a reference to where David Drumm allegedly plucked the figure for Angloâs bailout requirements. One of the panellists for that discussion is another American visitor to the festival, Deirdre McCloskey, a renowned professor of economics in Chicago and an old acquaintance of Milton Friedman. McCloskey was actually born Donald McCloskey, but became a woman in 1995. Set Theatre event While the Anglo-inspired arse discussion is on at Cleereâs, another event will be taking place across town at the Set Theatre â âIs Big Business Killing Sport?â. On the panel there is Fintan Drury, described by the organisers as a âsports agentâ. Drury is, of course, a sports agent, and a mightily successful one at that. What the festival organisers donât say is that he was also a director of Anglo Irish Bank for six years until it hit the buffers in 2008. He was also the man who helped to facilitate Brian Cowenâs infamous game of golf with Seanie Fitzpatrick at Druidâs Glen, just as the house was about to fall down. I donât blame him for missing the gig at Cleereâs. The festival runs from November 7th until November 10th. .

FA Cup losing its sheen FA Cup losing its sheen The FA Cup used to be sacrosanct. Regardless of the demands on the top teams they would always field their strongest teams in the FA Cup. Nobody messed about with the FA Cup and it is disappointing that this has changed. It has all come about from the number of competitions that the top sides enter and the amount of games they play in a season. I'm not saying there are necessarily more competitions but more teams play in Europe and the Champions League is fixture intensive. Foreign coaches in particular seem to want to rest more players in the FA Cup - they probably don't realise the stature and long history of the competition. The Champions League is the main competition for the top managers, followed by the Premiership and the FA Cup comes in a poor third. I think this is bound to affect the way in which people view the competition - and it takes some of the gloss off Burnley's brilliant victory over Liverpool. Liverpool boss Rafael Benitez fielded a lot of their youngsters who usually play in the reserves and Burnley were justifiable winners. They played some good football, were well organised and had too much experience for their opponents. I think the majority of Championship teams are now too good for Premiership reserve sides. Nonetheless, as a manager of a Championship team I would always rather play a full-strength Premiership team. Obviously coming up a side without many first-choice players increases your chances of winning the tie but you want to play against the big names. As Burnley boss Steve Cotterill correctly pointed out, Liverpool had some good players in their team, but it was not a full-strength side and that tarnishes the result. The glory is not quite the same. By not playing their first team it almost gives Liverpool an excuse for going out. I was delighted that Aston Villa played their best side when we played them. Our victory, along with Burnley's win on Tuesday, Sunderland's victory over Crystal Palace and West Ham's defeat of Norwich is good news for the Championship. It shows the quality that is within the Championship - and how little difference there is between the top clubs in the division and the lower-end Premiership clubs. Finally this week, a word on the dispute between Sir Alex Ferguson and Arsene Wenger. There have been calls for a summit to end the row - but if I'm honest I have to say I enjoy reading about it. Alex and Arsene are two experienced managers who know what they are doing and I say let them get on with it. The big winner from all of this is Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho. I really enjoy watching his post-match news conferences and he has been a breath of fresh air in the Premiership. Manchester United and Arsenal have had it their own way for so long that it is good to have a new kid on the block. Comments are closed for this article.
FA probes crowd trouble FA probes crowd trouble The FA is to take action after trouble marred Wednesday's Carling Cup tie between Chelsea and West Ham. Police in riot gear were confronted by a section of the West Ham support after the match which the Blues won 1-0. Mateja Kezman, the scorer of Chelsea's goal, needed treatment on a head injury during the match after being hit by a missile, believed to be a coin. A spokeswoman for Chelsea said the club would await the referee's report before deciding on its course of action. Kezman was forced off the field to receive treatment on a cut above his eye but was able to continue. Chelsea assistant boss Steve Clarke said: "I would rather talk about the football but we think it was something thrown from the crowd. He did not require stitches." West Ham boss Alan Pardew said: "It's a shame because I thought there was good English banter in the crowd. "There's big rivalry between the two clubs and it is a shame if that's happened. From where I was standing I didn't see any trouble." Former Hammers star Joe Cole also had a plastic bottle thrown at him, while Frank Lampard was pelted with coins as he was preparing to take a penalty. Lampard's spot-kick was saved to the delight of the Hammers' fans, who have still not forgiven him for leaving Upton Park. The FA will seek reports from the clubs and the police, and will review video evidence and the referee's report. Police in riot gear battled with West Ham fans in the Matthew Harding stand and at least one supporter required treatment. Fans are also thought to have clashed outside the ground after the game. Scotland Yard said there had been 11 arrests for alleged public order, drugs and offensive weapon offences. The FA is already looking into the trouble at Tuesday's heated Carling Cup tie between Millwall and Liverpool. Comments are closed for this article.
Fast lifts rise into record books Fast lifts rise into record books Two high-speed lifts at the world's tallest building have been officially recognised as the planet's fastest. The lifts take only 30 seconds to whisk passengers to the top of the 508m tall TFC 101 Tower in Taipei, Taiwan. The Guinness Book of Records has declared the 17m per second speed of the two lifts the swiftest on Earth. The lifts also have a pressure control system to stop passengers' ears popping as they ascend and descend at high speed. In total, the TFC Tower has 61 lifts, 34 of them double-deckers, and 50 escalators to shuttle people around its 106 floors. The TFC 101 Tower is due to be officially opened on 31 December. The super-fast lifts can speed up to 24 passengers to the tip of the tower in about 30 seconds, while ascending their 382m track. The 17m/s top speed of the lifts translates to about 38mph (61km/h). Curiously the lifts take longer to descend and spend almost a whole minute returning to ground level from the top of the TFC Tower. The key new technologies applied in the world's fastest elevators include: - A pressure control system, which adjusts the atmospheric pressure inside a car by using suction and discharge blowers, preventing "ear popping" - An active control system which tries to balance the lift more finely and remove the sources of vibrations - Streamlined cars to reduce the whistling noise produced by running the lifts at a high speed inside a narrow shaft "The certification of our elevators as world record-holders by the authoritative Guinness World Records is a great honour for us," said Masayuki Shimono, president of manufacturer Toshiba Elevator and Building Systems which installed the lifts. The first record for the world's fastest passenger elevators was published in the first edition of the Guinness Book of Records in 1955. "As such, it is an interesting indicator of how technology has advanced in the 50 years since that first edition, when the record was 426m per minute, or 25.6 km/h, less than half the speed of the new record," said Hein Le Roux, specialist researcher at the Guinness World Records. Taipei's TFC 101 Tower is more than 50m taller than the Petronas Towers in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia - formerly the world's tallest skyscraper. Return to results
Featured: 'Brainwave' cap controls computer 'Brainwave' cap controls computer A team of US researchers has shown that controlling devices with the brain is a step closer. Four people, two of them partly paralysed wheelchair users, successfully moved a computer cursor while wearing a cap with 64 electrodes. Previous research has shown that monkeys can control a computer with electrodes implanted into their brain. The New York team reported their findings in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. "The results show that people can learn to use scalp-recorded electroencephalogram rhythms to control rapid and accurate movement of a cursor in two directions," said Jonathan Wolpaw and Dennis McFarlane. The research team, from New York State Department of Health and State University of New York in Albany, said the research was another step towards people controlling wheelchairs or other electronic devices by thought. The four people faced a large video screen wearing a special cap which, meant no surgery or implantation was needed. Brain activity produces electrical signals that can be read by electrodes. Complex algorithms then translate those signals into instructions to direct the computer. Such brain activity does not require the use of any nerves of muscles, so people with stroke or spinal cord injuries could use the cap effectively. "The impressive non-invasive multidimensional control achieved in the present study suggests that a non-invasive brain control interface could support clinically useful operation of a robotic arm, a motorised wheelchair or a neuroprosthesis," said the researchers. The four volunteers also showed that they could get better at controlling the cursor the more times they tried. Although the two partially-paralysed people performed better overall, the researchers said this could be because their brains were more used to adapting or that they were simply more motivated. It is not the first time researchers have had this sort of success in brain-control experiments. Some teams have used eye motion and other recording techniques. Earlier this year, a team at the MIT Media Labs Europe demonstrated a wireless cap which read brain waves to control a computer character. Return to results
Featured: 'Ultimate game' award for Doom 3 'Ultimate game' award for Doom 3 Sci-fi shooter Doom 3 has blasted away the competition at a major games ceremony, the Golden Joystick awards. It was the only title to win twice, winning Ultimate Game of the year and best PC game at the awards, presented by Little Britain star Matt Lucas. The much-anticipated sci-fi horror Doom 3 shot straight to the top of the UK games charts on its release in August. Other winners included Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas which took the Most Wanted for Christmas prize. Only released last week, it was closely followed by Halo 2 and Half-Life 2, which are expected to be big hits when they are unleashed later this month. But they missed out on the prize for the Most Wanted game of 2005, which went to the Nintendo title, The Legend of Zelda. The original Doom, released in 1994, heralded a new era in computer games and introduced 3D graphics. It helped to establish the concept of the first-person shooter. Doom 3 was developed over four years and is thought to have cost around $15m (Â£8.3m). The top honour for the best online game of the year went to Battlefield Vietnam. The Chronicles of Riddick: Escape from Butcher Bay was handed the Unsung Hero Game of 2004. Its release was somewhat eclipsed by Doom 3, which was released on the same week. It was, however, very well received by gamers and was praised for its storyline which differed from the film released around the same time. Electronic Arts was named top publisher of the year, taking the crown from Nintendo which won in 2003. The annual awards are voted for by more than 200,000 readers of computer and video games magazines. Games awards like this have grown in importance. Over the last six years, the UK market for games grew by 100% and was worth a record Â£1,152m in 2003, according to a recent report by analysts Screen Digest. Comments are closed for this article.
Ferguson urges Henry punishment Ferguson urges Henry punishment Sir Alex Ferguson has called on the Football Association to punish Arsenal's Thierry Henry for an incident involving Gabriel Heinze. Ferguson believes Henry deliberately caught Heinze on the head with his knee during United's controversial win. The United boss said it was worse than Ruud van Nistelrooy's foul on Ashley Cole for which he got a three-game ban. "We shall present it to the FA and see what they do. The tackle on Heinze was terrible," he said. Clubs are permitted to ask the FA to examine specific incidents but information is expected to be provided within 48 hours of the game. The clash occurred moments before half-time when a Freddie Ljungberg challenge left Heinze on the ground on the left touchline. Henry, following the ball, attempted to hurdle the Argentine but his knee collided with the back of Heinze's head. The striker protested his innocence - and referee Mike Riley deemed the collision accidental. Ferguson was also upset by Arsenal's overall discipline during the heated encounter between the two arch-rivals and praised his own side's behaviour. "Edu produced a terrible tackle on Scholes that was a potential leg-breaker," he said. "There were 24 fouls in the game by Arsenal, seven on Heinze, five on Ronaldo, six by Vieira - and it was only his sixth foul that got him booked. Phil Neville got booked for his first challenge. "I am proud of my players for the way they handled that pressure. "We have always been good at being gracious in defeat. What happened on Sunday overshadowed our achievement, but then they do it all the time, don't they?" Comments are closed for this article.
First look at PlayStation 3 chip First look at PlayStation 3 chip Some details of the chip inside Sony's PlayStation 3 have been revealed. Sony, IBM and Toshiba have released limited data about the so-called Cell chip that will be able to carry out trillions of calculations per second. The chip will be made of several different processing cores that work on tasks together. The PlayStation 3 is expected in 2006 but developers are expecting to get prototypes early next year to tune games that will appear on it at launch. The three firms have been working on the chip since 2001 but before now few details have been released about how it might function. In a joint statement the three firms gave hints about how the chip will work but fuller details will be released in February next year at the International Solid State Circuits Conference in San Francisco. The three firms claim that the Cell chip will be up to 10 times more powerful than existing processors. When put inside powerful computer servers, the Cell consortium expects it to be capable of handling 16 trillion floating point operations, or calculations, every second. The chip has also been refined to be able to handle the detailed graphics common in games and the data demands of films and broadband media. IBM said it would start producing the chip in early 2005 at manufacturing plants in the US. The first machines off the line using the Cell processor will be computer workstations and servers. A working version of the PS3 is due to be shown off in May 2005 but a full launch of the next generation console is not expected to start until 2006. As well as being inside the PlayStation 3, the chip will also be used inside high-definition TVs and powerful computers. "In the future, all forms of digital content will be converged and fused onto the broadband network," said Ken Kutaragi, Chief Operating Officer of Sony. "Current PC architecture is nearing its limits." Return to results
Fitch Ratings warned yesterday it could cut the sovereign credit rating of the United States from AA... Fitch Ratings warned yesterday it could cut the sovereign credit rating of the United States from AAA citing the political brinkmanship over raising the federal debt ceiling. âAlthough Fitch continues to believe that the debt ceiling will be raised soon, the political brinkmanship and reduced financing flexibility could increase the risk of a U.S. default,â the firm said in a statement. Fitch is the only one of the three major credit rating agencies to have a negative outlook on the U.S. sovereign credit. Standard & Poorâs downgraded the rating to AA-plus in August of 2011 during the last debt ceiling impasse. Fitch reiterated that the delay in increasing the borrowing capacity of the United States raises questions about the full faith and credit of the United States to honor its obligations. The U.S. Treasury has said that on or about Oct. 17, the U.S. will have run out of cash to pay its bills. A U.S. Treasury spokesman said Fitchâs decision is a reminder for U.S. lawmakers that the United States is dangerously close to defaulting on its obligations. Last week Fitch said that it would only consider the United States in default if it failed to make payments due on interest or principal of U.S. Treasuries.

Photograph: Frank Miller Irish and South African companies can benefit equally from the work being done to strengthen economic ties between the two countries, according to former South African reserve bank governor Tito Mboweni . Mr Mboweni, a speaker at the third annual Africa Ireland Economic Forum in Dublin this week, stressed the scope for economic growth that could be derived from a mutually beneficial partnership between both countries. Direct investment in Ireland by South African companies stands at only 9.2 percent of the total amount channelled into the country, he said, with the major portion â 90 per cent â coming in the form of portfolio investments. âThere is a large amount of South African funds invested in the Irish financial markets,â he said. âSpike in investmentâ Mr Mboweni said while Ireland had experienced significant economic difficulties in recent years, he was confident the country would overcome them, and that the improving economic investment climate would be attractive to African companies. âThe next 10 to 15 years will see a major spike in investment flows [into Ireland]â¬2.7 billion in 2011, an increase of 200 per cent since 2009, but trade with the continent is expected to reach â¬24 billion by the end of the decade. Mr Mboweni said sub-Saharan African economies were growing at about 6 per cent a year. âThere is major growth in Nigeria , Ethiopia , Ghana , Angola and Mozambique , which is currently an $18 billion GDP economy, but in the next 15 years it has the possibility of becoming a $50 billion GDP economy due to its oil and gas finds.â .

G20 hopes grow for US deal to avert default G20 hopes grow for US deal to avert default Republican plan to extend borrowing spurs optimism debt crisis can be averted US Treasury secretary Jack Lew and Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke assured their G20 counterparts at a dinner last night that a resolution would be reached to avoid a debt crisis. Photograph: Michael Nagle/Online News Top finance officials from the G20 leading economies looked set to keep their focus on the receding risk of a US default at talks today as hopes grew that Washington could soon clinch a stop-gap deal to ensure it can keep paying its bills. Officials from across the Group of 20 nations had warned that a failure by the US Congress to raise the nationâs $16.7 trillion (â¬12.3 trillion) debt ceiling would wreak havoc on the global economy. The US Treasury has said it could quickly run out of cash if the cap is not raised by October 17th. A failure to lift it, officials warned, could spark a financial crisis and tip the worldâs largest economy into recession with damaging repercussions that would be felt worldwide. But that risk receded yesterday as Republicans presented a plan to extend the nationâs borrowing authority, opening a door for talks with the White House . Republicans have sought to use the need to raise the debt limit as leverage to force the White House to agree on budget cuts or to force changes in president Barack Obamaâs signature health care law. US Treasury secretary Jack Lew and Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke assured their G20 counterparts at a dinner last night that a resolution would be reached in time. âThey said that the problem will be solved by the 17th,â Anton Siluanov , finance minister of this yearâs G20 host Russia , told reporters. âBoth Lew and Bernanke believe that these difficulties can be overcome soon.â Talks between the White House and Republican lawmakers pushed late into the night, but signs of progress earlier had already fueled the biggest Wall Street rally since January 2nd. âIt is quite clear that America has been pulled back from the brink, as sensible people expected,â Australian treasurer Joe Hockey told reporters ahead of the dinner of top finance officials from the G20 developed and emerging economies. âThis is an important step forward,â he said. After a second round of talks today, the G20 is due to issue a communique offering its views on the world economy and steps that could be taken to strengthen it. Mr Siluanov said the communique would refer to the G20âs shared worries about what a US debt impasse could mean for the world economy. âThere will be a general wish for a fast solution of the problem. There will be a couple of propositions - that we are of course concerned and that we wish for a speedy resolution of the situation,â he said. Mr Siluanov added that the statement would be just two pages, with most of the phrasing taken from a document adopted by G20 leaders at a summit in St Petersburg in September. âVery little time has passed since,â he said. Officials from around the world had expressed confidence the United States would break through the political logjam that had already led to a partial shutdown of the US government. The risk of a US default, which G20 officials had always considered remote but which had appeared on the rise in recent days, had clouded an already soft outlook for the world economy. The IMF this week cut its forecasts for global growth, saying an expected pickup in rich nations, including the United States, would likely not be enough to offset slower growth in emerging markets. It warned that forecast would be thrown off badly were the United States to default. Some of the sternest warnings to Washington came from the biggest holders of US government debt. âThey should have the wisdom to solve this problem as soon as possible,â said Yi Gang , the number two at Chinaâs central bank. China is the United Statesâ top foreign creditor with more than $1.2 trillion of US Treasuries; Japan is a close second. âThe problem needs to be cleared quickly because United States is in a position where it is pulling the rest of the world economy,â said Bank of Japan governor Haruhiko Kuroda .

Gamer buys $26,500 virtual land Gamer buys $26,500 virtual land A 22-year-old gamer has spent $26,500 (Â£13,700) on an island that exists only in a computer role-playing game (RPG). The Australian gamer, known only by his gaming moniker Deathifier, bought the island in an online auction. The land exists within the game Project Entropia, an RPG which allows thousands of players to interact with each other. Entropia allows gamers to buy and sell virtual items using real cash, while fans of other titles often use auction site eBay to sell their virtual wares. Earlier this year economists calculated that these massively multi-player online role-playing games (MMORPGs) have a gross economic impact equivalent to the GDP of the African nation of Namibia. "This is a historic moment in gaming history, and this sale only goes to prove that massive multi-player online gaming has reached a new plateau," said Marco Behrmann, director of community relations at Mindark, the game's developer. The virtual island includes a gigantic abandoned castle and beautiful beaches which are described as ripe for developing beachfront property. Deathifier will make money from his investment as he is able to tax other gamers who come to his virtual land to hunt or mine for gold. He has also begun to sell plots to people who wish to build virtual homes. "This type of investment will definitely become a trend in online gaming," said Deathifier. The Entopia economy lets gamers exchange real currency into PED (Project Entropia Dollars) and back again into real money. Ten PEDs are the equivalent to one US dollar and typical items sold include iron ingots ($5) and shogun armour ($1.70) Gamers can theoretically earn money by accumulating PEDs through the acquisition of goods, buildings, and land in the Entropia universe. MMORPGs have become enormously popular in the last 10 years with hundreds of thousands of gamers living out alternate lives in fantasy worlds. Almost 200,000 people are registered players on Project Entropia. Return to results
Government will consider âbest optionsâ for bailout exit Government will consider âbest optionsâ for bailout exit Most analysts expect Ireland to seek some form of aid on its return to the markets Taoiseach Enda Kenny said the EU meeting would give him a chance to brief his European counterparts on the situation in Ireland. Photograph: Alan Betson/Online News The Government will consider âthe best optionsâ for the country to exit the bailout following discussions with its lending partners, Taoiseach Enda Kenny has said. He was speaking at an event in Dublin this morning before flying to Brussels for a two-day summit with European leaders, the final leadersâ summit before Irelandâs scheduled bailout exit on December 15th. Mr Kenny said the meeting would give him a chance to brief European leaders on the situation âas it now stands in Ireland . â Referring to Minister for Finance Michael Noonanâs ongoing discussions with EU and ECB leaders, Mr Kenny said: âThe Government will consider what the best options are for exiting the bailout programme following these discussions.â Most analysts expect Ireland to seek some form of precautionary credit when it returns to the capital markets, not least because rating agency Moodyâs continues to apply a junk rating to Irish Government bonds. There is speculation the Government may seek whatâs known as an Enhanced Conditions Credit Line (ECCL) from the EU. An ECCL is normally tied to certain corrective measures and has an initial duration of one year but is renewable twice, for six months each time. The Government is understood to want to minimise the conditions associated with such aid. Speaking at an event in the National Gallery in Dublin celebrating the 50th anniversary of charity group Chesire Ireland, Mr Kenny said he would again urge European leaders to fulfil their pledge to break the link between sovereign and bank debt. âOne of the failings or inadequacies of the European Council over the years has been an inability to actually complete programmes where decisions are made,â he said. âIn this regard, I refer to the decisions that were made last year in respect of banking union. For Ireland and for other countries, it is absolutely critical that we follow those things through to completion before moving on to any other agendas.â Mr Kenny sent a letter to his European counterparts last night renewing his demand to but the link between bank and sovereign debt. Though EU leaders agreed last year to use the European Stability Mechanism bailout fund to rescue failing banks on a case-by-case basis, there is still a dispute over whether this will entail retrospective aid to bailed-out Irish banks.

Growth predicted to accelerate to 2.4 per cent in 2014 Growth predicted to accelerate to 2.4 per cent in 2014 British chancellor of the exchequer George Osborne â who has been under fire from the majority of economists for artificially stoking up demand in Britainâs housing market â with Minister for Finance Michael Noonan. Photograph: David Sleator Business investment and exports are likely to take over from housing and consumption as the driving force of economic recovery next year, according to the autumn forecast of the EY (formerly Ernst & Young) Item Club, giving the UK economy a better balance. Growth in 2013 is expected to hit 1.4 per cent, far above the 0.7 per cent forecast by the Office for Budget Responsibility in March, with an acceleration to 2.4 per cent in 2014, close to Britainâs long-term average. The UK was âfinally on the moveâ, said Mark Gregory, Ernst & Youngâs chief economist, adding: âItâs perhaps unsurprising that business investment to date has been cautious. But with the recovery now gathering pace, businesses will need to keep a close eye on economic indicators to ensure they are ready to move when the tide turns.â The more positive forecast reflects the rapidly improving business conditions in Britain. The UK received the largest forecast upgrade of any leading economy from the IMF at last weekâs annual meetings and was singled out for the praise. Professor Peter Spencer, chief economic adviser to the Item Club, said one of the most important reasons for the upturn in sentiment and spending was the governmentâs initiatives to get the housing market moving again. Coming to the aid of George Osborne, chancellor, who has been under fire from the majority of economists for artificially stoking up demand in the housing market, Prof Spencer said the interventions into the mortgage market were well-timed and targeted. -(The Financial Times Limited 2013) Comments are closed for this article.
Halo 2 heralds traffic explosion Halo 2 heralds traffic explosion The growing popularity of online gaming could spell problems for net service firms, warns network monitoring company Sandvine. It issued the warning following analysis which shows that traffic on the Xbox game network increased fourfold on the launch day of Halo 2. The 9 November traffic explosion has continued into December, said Sandvine. Service providers now need to make sure that their networks can cope with the increasing demands for bandwidth. As well as being a popular single-player title, Halo 2 can be connected to Microsoft's subscription-based broadband network, Xbox Live. Gamers who want to play online can create their own clan, or team, and take on others to see how well they compare. But the surge in numbers and huge demands for bandwidth should be a wake-up call to the industry which must ensure that their networks can cope with the increases in traffic, said Sandvine's chief technology officer Marc Morin. In a bid to cope and ease congestion, providers are increasingly making their networks intelligent, finding out who is using bandwidth and for what. It could become common to charge people for the amount of bandwidth they use. "The explosion in Xbox Live traffic attributed to Halo 2 should be seen as a clarion call," he said. "ISPs need to enhance the broadband experience for these high-end users by prioritising or reserving bandwidth for games," he added. One of the main factors that spoils online gaming is "lag" in which there is a noticeable delay between a gamer clicking on a mouse or keyboard and what happens in the online gaming world. Gamers tend to migrate toward networks with the lowest "lag". Analysing traffic will become increasingly important for service providers if they are to hold on to bandwidth-hungry gamers said Lindsay Schroth, an analyst with research firm The Yankee Group. "In the competitive broadband environment, operators need to differentiate the way they offer access to services like live-play gaming," she said. In countries such as Korea, which has high levels of fast net connections to homes, online gaming is hugely popular. Comments are closed for this article.
Health chiefs warn â¬1 billion in cuts needed Health chiefs warn â¬1 billion in cuts needed Additional cuts required if maternity reforms and other initiatives to be funded Senior health figures last night maintained that for many of these initiatives either there was no money available or else funding was only available from once-off sources. MARTIN WALL and PAUL CULLEN Cuts of up to â¬1 billion will be needed in the health service next year - around â¬350 million more than announced in this weeks 2014 Budget - if promised initiatives such as upgrading maternity facilities in the wake of the Savita Halappanavar case are to be implemented, senior health service sources are warning. Senior health figureslast night maintained that either there was no money specially provided or else funding was only available from once-off sources to finance a number of key developments and to deal with service pressures. These included complying with the Galway maternity report, implementing the new deal on working time rules for doctors and providing capacity to deal with increased demands for radiotherapy for cancer patients. Highly-placed health sources maintained that if the cost of these and other initiatives and services had to be met from existing resources, the cuts required in the health budget next year would be in the region of â¬1 billion and not the â¬666 million set out by the Government in the Budget. Separately there is also deepening concern within the HSE about the impact of the Governmentâs controversial move to reduce tax relief on health insurance subscriptions which was also announced in the Budget. Highly placed sources maintained this could destabilise the private health insurance market and pile additional pressure on the public health system. The proposed health spending announced in Tuesdayâs Budget has been the focus of controversy all week, particularly in relation to the â¬666 million ear-marked for health savings in 2014 and the â¬113 million which is supposed to be generated by means of âprobityâ measures in relation to the medical card scheme. Minister for Education Ruairi Quinn has said a âstand-offâ between ministers in relation to medical card spending and the projected savings in health from the Haddington Road Agreement was only resolved last Sunday by an agreement that the figures would be validated by a process involving the Department of the Taoiseach and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform as well as the Department of Health . The concern within health relates to services which are either currently not provided or are provided but funded from once-off sources, and for which no allocation was made in the Budget figures. Demographic pressures such as the ageing of the population and the growth in the birth rate mean that demand for health service is increasing automatically, but a range of new service pressures is also helping to push spending upwards. The recent Hiqa report into the death of Ms Halappanavar drew attention to under-staffing in Irish maternity services and called for a national review of the sector. This will have âresource implications,â the chief executive of the West/North West hospital group, Bill Maher, pointed out yesterday. He said he would be raising the immediate implementation of Hiqaâs recommendations with the HSE and the Department of Health. The deal recently struck with non-consultant hospital doctors (NCHDs) to shorten their working hours will also have significant cost implications for hospitals. The provision of bilateral cochlear implants for profoundly deaf children, described by the Minister for Health James Reilly as one of his top priorities, will cost over â¬12.5 million a year, while similar amounts will be required to fund home care packages for children with significant medical needs. Other areas seen as giving rise to significant extra costs include renal services, living and deceased donor programmes, and the increased demand for radiotherapy. Separately highly-placed sources said there was âdeeping concernâ in the HSE at the Governmentâs decision to cap tax relief on health insurance subscriptions at â¬1,000 for adults, a move which will increase premium costs for hundreds of thousands of people. Sources said this move could generate a âtriple whammyâ for the health service. They forecast it could lead to increased demand on an over-stretched and increasingly under-funded public hospital system next year . Senior health service figures also maintained it could also mean to less income being generated from patients with health insurance who are treated in public hospitals at a time when this amount was scheduled to rise. Sources also maintained that the Government move could adversely affect moves to realised an âacceleratedâ provision of funding from health insurers by the end of the year. .

Healthcare system could learn a lesson from Advance Pitstop Healthcare system could learn a lesson from Advance Pitstop âDisruptive innovation, which entails radical service reconfiguration and deep cultural reform, will require expertise in managing complex change and courageous leadership by all interested groups. It will not all come down to James Reilly.â Photograph: University Hospital Southampton NHS Foundation Trust /PA Wire Eddie Molloy For the sixth year in a row pre-budget political tensions and pubic dismay at the announced âhitsâcrystalise a central challenge for Irish society: how to provide decent public services in an affordable manner. Is there a better way to resolve this dilemma than by continuing to cut services and increase the cost? Is there a smarter way? Five years ago Harvard professor Clayton Christensen presciently remarked: âHealthcare is a terminal illness for Americaâs governments and businesses. We are in big troubleâ. Just weeks ago this still unresolved healthcare crisis threatened the very capacity of the US to govern itself effectively. He might well have been speaking of Ireland. We too are in big trouble over healthcare. Christensen famously coined the term âdisruptive innovationâ to describe a type of innovation that has revolutionised many industries, such as phones, air travel and computers, making products and services more affordable and accessible to everyone, and not just rich people. In The Innovatorâs Prescription (2009) he applied his ideas to healthcare systems, distinguishing three types of ailment. It is impossible to summarise the book here, but a mundane illustration may help: I had a flat tyre recently and instead of leaving it in a high-tech workshop as if I had crashed the car I drove straight into Advance Pitstop and was out in 20 minutes with the tyre fixed for â¬15. lllnesses for which medical advances can now provide a definitive diagnosis and specify an effective remedy may be routinised and treated in specialised centres, analogous to Advance Pitstop, such as eye surgery clinics or heart centres, instead of being bundled in with more complex cases in a large general hospital, which is ultimately a highly inefficient arrangement that delivers suboptimal care. An example is the vascular surgery unit in the Galway Clinic . At a conference in Trinity College two years ago, Niamh Hynes of the clinic set out a compelling case for separating out from general hospitals and streamlining procedures that can more or less be routinised. Her comparison of the cost and quality of the clinicâs services versus similar services provided by University College Hospital, Galway, were truly remarkable. For example, âcost per any procedureâ was â¬22,850 in UCHG and â¬6,455 in the clinic. More importantly Hynes reported superior outcomes for patients, which generally happens when clinicians work on the same problem repeatedly. Second category The second category of health problem which Christensen suggests requires the expertise of a âsolution shopâ in healthcare, meaning a fully equipped hospital or multidisciplinary team. This area includes more complex cases like car crash victims or difficult-to- diagnose illnesses where intuition and trial-and-error by very experienced clinicians and other professionals offer the best prospects. .

Henchoz prefers England to Gers Henchoz prefers England to Gers Rangers could miss out on Liverpool defender Stephane Henchoz because he wants to continue playing in England. The Ibrox club have offered a deal to the Swiss international, 30, who is out of contract at the end of the season and has been linked with Southampton. More talks are planned between Rangers and the player's agent on Wednesday, but Henchoz said: "Actually I would like to stay in the Premiership. "Rangers' offer is not the only one and I will have to consider each of them." Henchoz seems certain to leave Liverpool after recently criticising manager Rafael Benitez. Rangers want him as a replacement for Jean-Alain Boumsong, who has moved to Newcastle for Â£8m. However, the former Blackburn defender is reported to have rejected an initial six-month contract offer as he wants at least an 18-month deal. Henchoz has played just four times for Liverpool this season and has yet to play in the league under Benitez. Comments are closed for this article.
Irish bond rally puts yields too low for some as bailout exit nears Irish bond rally puts yields too low for some as bailout exit nears Goldman Sachs and BlueBay Asset Management are among firms saying yields are now too low Some say yields are now too low for a country that â is barely growing and still with a debt load bigger than its economy. Photograph: Scott Eells/Online News The longest bond rally since 2005 is making Irish securities too expensive for some investors just as the State begins to rely on their money again. The extra yield, or spread, over German bunds slid to a three-year low this month as Ireland moved closer to exiting the â¬67.5 billion emergency aid programme it took in November 2010. Goldman Sachs and BlueBay Asset Management are among the financial companies judging that the yields are now too low for a country that is barely growing and still with a debt load bigger than its economy. âWith the spreads where they are now, we think there are better stories, better places to invest,â said Russel Matthews , a fund manager at BlueBay in London, which oversees $56 billion and has been putting money into Portuguese and Slovenian bonds. âWe are positive on the story, but from a valuation perspective we donât think itâs that exciting.â Irelandâs 10-year borrowing costs tumbled to 3.53 per cent yesterday from a euro-era high of more than 14 per cent in July 2011. That compares with 6.71 per cent for Slovenian bonds and 6.17 per cent for Portugal , whose government is aiming to follow Ireland and leave its own bailout programme next year. Deutsche Asset and Wealth Management, which oversees $1.24 trillion, reduced its Irish holdings after the rally, even as it remained positive on the outlook for the country, Oliver Eichmann , head of euro fixed income at the company in Frankfurt, said in an email yesterday. The spread on Irish securities over bunds narrowed to 1.69 percentage points on October 17th, the lowest since April 2010, according to data. The rally has also pushed Irish yields below those of Italy and Spain . âWe currently view Irish bonds as expensive,â Goldman Sachs analysts Francesco Garzarelli and Silvia Ardagna wrote in a note to clients last week. âThe market has taken a constructive view on upcoming developmentsâ regarding the Stateâs return to bond markets, they wrote. Technical analysis based on how Irish bonds have performed compared with peers supports that view. The 14-day relative strength index for 10-year Irish securities reached 83.9 last week, the most since April. It has been above 70, a level that signals it has climbed too much, for 20 consecutive days. The gauge was above 70 for 10 consecutive days ending May 10th â before the yields climbed more than 50 basis points in the following two months. â (Online News) Return to results
Irish bond yields fall to 4-month low Irish bond yields fall to 4-month low Ten-year bond yields decline as Michael Noonan prepares trips to discuss exit from bailout programme. Irelandâs 10-year yield fell four basis points, or 0.04 percentage points, to 3.68 per cent at lunch-time today, after dropping to 3.67 per cent, the least since May 31st. The 3.9 per cent bond due in March 2023 rose 0.28, or â¬2.80 per â¬1,000 face amount, to â¬101.725. Talks on Irelandâs exit from its bailout programme are set to gain pace this month, with Minister for Finance Michael Noonan set to travel to both Strasbourg and Washington to discuss the countryâs options. Taoiseach Enda Kenny said at the weekend that Ireland would exit its three-year bailout on December 15th. Mr Noonan will travel to Strasbourg on October 23rd and October 24th to meet European Commission and European Central Bank staff, before flying to Washington for meetings with the International Monetary Fund (IMF)on October 28th. According to the Department of Finance , the talks will focus âon what options may be available to Ireland as it exits the bailout, including potential backstopsâ. In Luxembourg today, Eurozone finance mainisters may discuss backstops and Irelandâs potential exit from the bailout programme, while Irelandâs bailout troika will begin their 12th review of the countryâs bailout program on October 29th. Meanwhile, a report from the IMF today said that tomorrowâs budget is âon trackâ, although it noted that buffers with respect to the 7.5 per cent of GDP deficit ceiling have narrowed. Consolidation efforts will continue in 2014 it said in its latest âFiscal Monitorâ report. From a wider European perspective, the IMF said in the report that Europe has already achieved about two-thirds of the adjustment needed to broadly balance the budget, asserting that reaching these medium-term objectives is well within the bounds of what has been done in history.However, it warned that adjustment fatigue looms large as economic growth remains anaemic.

Irish debt linked to Angela Merkel talks on coalition Irish debt linked to Angela Merkel talks on coalition Social Democratic party has set its face against using ESM permanent bailout fund to provide capital directly to Irish banks Leading members of the German Christian Democrats (CDU), including Chancellor Angela Merkel andHorst Seehofer (right of Merkel), chairman of the bavrian Christian Democrats (CSU), arrive for talks over a possible government coalition with the German Greens Party yesterday in Berlin. Photograph: Sean Gallup/Getty Images. Arthur Beesley, Suzanne Lynch Irelandâs corporate tax regime and the Governmentâs claim for further bank aid from Europe has been sucked into talks on the formation of the next German government. In discussions with German chancellor Angela Merkel , the opposition Social Democratic party has set its face against using the ESM permanent bailout fund to provide capital directly to Irish banks. The SPD is further reported to be seeking âfar-reaching commitments from Dublinâ on tax issues in return for any emergency loan facility from the ESM, a kind of overdraft to be used if investor confidence is suddenly lost. While Dr Merkel is already reluctant to deploy the ESM for direct bank recapitalisations in Ireland or any other country, it is argued in German official circles that the SPD is even more strongly resistant to the notion. âBinding preconditionâ Having won last monthâs election, the chancellorâs Christian Democratic party is now in coalition talks with the second-placed SPD because she lacks a parliamentary majority. The protection of taxpayers from costly bank bailouts is being described as a âbinding preconditionâ for the SPD in these talks. As the negotiation continues, the SÃ¼ddeutsche Zeitung reported yesterday that the SPD sees no circumstances in which it would support direct ESM aid to Irelandâs banks. SPD finance spokesman Carsten Schneider was quoted saying such a programme would be possible only if Dublin granted two concessions on business taxation. Tax plans Ireland would be obliged first to drop its opposition to a stalled European plan to tax financial transactions. Ireland would also be obliged to increase the 12.5 per cent corporate tax rate, something the Coalition has vowed not to do. There was no comment last evening from the spokesman for the Government, which expects a smooth exit from the EU/IMF bailout in December. In German official circles right now, the clear sense remains that Ireland is not a cause for any concern and that the likely return to private bond markets demonstrates that the State has no need for any more debt relief. An Irish source said the Government would never comment on reports on coalition talks in any other country. It is understood, however, that the Government sees no erosion of Dr Merkelâs pledge one year ago to treat Irelandâs banking problem as a âspecial caseâ. Comments are closed for this article.
Israeli club look to Africa Israeli club look to Africa Four African players, including Zimbabwe goalkeeper Energy Murambadoro, are all ready to play for Israeli club Hapoel Bnei Sakhnin in the Uefa Cup. Bnei Sakhnin are the first Arab side ever to play in European competition and will play English Premiership side Newcastle United in the first round. Warriors' goalkeeper Murambadoro, who made a name for himself at the African Nations Cup finals in Tunisia, helped Bnei Sakhnin overcome Albania's Partizani Tirana 6-1 in the previous round. Murambadoro moved to Israel recently after a brief stint with South African club Hellenic. The club won the Israeli Cup final last season and are based in Sakhnin, which is near Haifa. The club have a strong ethic and are high profile promoters of peace and co-operation within Israel. The three other Africans at the club are former Cameroon defender Ernest Etchi, DR Congo's Alain Masudi and Nigerian midfielder Edith Agoye, who had a stint with Tunisian side Esperance.

Itâs too early for talk of recovery but signs are good Itâs too early for talk of recovery but signs are good We still have not dealt with mortgage arrears in any meaningful way We should look overseas for guidance about what happens next - itâs a familiar picture. A raft of economic data published over the past few days paints a fascinating but occasionally contradictory picture of the Irish economy. Has the recovery started? The mortgage arrears data released yesterday hints that at least one part of the problem may not be getting any worse: the absolute number of arrears fell, slightly, for the first time. While one number does not make a trend, it is encouraging that at least something is moving in the right direction. However, it is far too early to begin to think that the problem is anywhere close to resolution. The data also contained confirmation of what we have known for a while, namely that we have not dealt with mortgage arrears in any meaningful way. While the number of new arrears is down, mortgages that have been festering for some time are just sitting there. There was a big jump in the number of problem loans 720 days or more in arrears; the good news â the fall in arrears â came at the front end, loans that are 90 days or less in distress. Restructuring (of sorts) is happening, has picked up a bit but is still painfully slow. New legislation has now been followed this week by the first personal insolvency case involving mortgage debt appearing before the courts. Again, a move in the right direction but slow â puzzlingly so. One of the great mysteries is why the Central Bank appears to have been less than robust in getting the banks, in particular, to move at a faster speed. Given the pace at which all of the vested interests seem happy to move, the best that we can hope for is that we soon begin talking about the ârumpâ of arrears, rather than its growth. In that way the problem becomes chronic rather than terminal. On the good news side was the employment data. This took just about everybody by surprise â with, perhaps, the possible exception of the ESRI who have been an outlier in terms of their upbeat assessment of where the economy is and where it is heading. A big fall in the unemployment rate to 12.6 per cent confirmed the labour market is starting to heal. Better employment news has been around for a little while now and might be thought inconsistent with trends in income tax data: if the numbers in work are up by so much, why are taxes not also showing more buoyancy? There are a number of possible explanations; one very tentative suspect is that a lot of the jobs might be lower paid. The truth is we donât know: more data is required before we can reach any firm conclusions. Retail sales were a little disappointing, particularly when set against the rise in the number of people at work. Again, people taking low paid jobs may be part of the story, but there are many other equally plausible explanations. If the rise in employment continues, there must be better news for retailers ahead. House prices, in Dublin at least, are on the up. Most people would consider this good news, although there has been some fanciful talk of a new bubble forming. The level of transactions is still way too low to draw any definitive conclusions. At least the precipitate declines have stopped. It is way too early to conclude that we have begun a sustainable recovery, although the numbers are encouraging. As always, we should look overseas for guidance about what happens next. There, the picture remains a familiar one: the UK is doing extremely well, the US is growing modestly, while in Europe , Germany is fine â but the rest of the euro area remains, at best, stuck in low or no growth. Markets got excited yesterday about stronger inflation from Germany â what we would expect and what is needed from a rebalancing perspective (Irelandâs inflation is virtually nil). Market expectations of further ECB monetary easing changed in the wake of the German inflation data. This sums up Europeâs problem: the ECB has to set policy for the euro area, not just one country. The Fed does not set policy just for New York. Hopes for European growth rest on more rational policy making. We are catching something of a tailwind from the UK and US, but we need European growth to boost our recovery hopes. Return to results
Kenny reiterates commitment to youth jobs guarantee scheme Kenny reiterates commitment to youth jobs guarantee scheme Ireland can avail of a â¬200 million fund over the next two years to create the guarantee scheme European Commission president Jose Manuel Barroso (left) speaks with German chancellor Angela Merkel (centre) and European Parliament president Martin Schultz (right) prior to an international summit on youth unemployment in the European Union at the Elysee Palace in Paris today. Photograph: Online News Ireland can avail of a â¬200 million fund to create a youth jobs guarantee over the next two years, Taoiseach Enda Kenny said following an EU summit on youth employment. Under the guarantee, no unemployed young person will be allowed to go longer than four months without a job offer or training. Asked whether the four-month deadline might have to be extended because of insufficient funds and inadequate training capacity, Mr Kenny said âThe plan will be ready (next month) and we will live up to the four-month commitment. We are absolutely focused on this.â The Taoiseach said that approximately â¬200 million would available over the next two years, of which about one third would be contributed by Ireland. JosÃ© Manuel Barroso, the president of the EU Commission, had promised their would be no delay in making the money available. Mr Kenny said Minister for Social Protection Joan Burton, who attended the summit with him, would present the plan. It will be discussed in the DÃ¡il before the end of December âand weâll proceed to implement it.â Regarding Irelandâs pending decision on whether to apply for a post-bailout line of credit, Mr Kenny said he briefed âat least eight of tenâ of the 24 leaders at the summit, including German Chancellor Angela Merkel . He told them the government was still consulting people and would make its decision before December 15th. âThe leaders were happy to be updated on that.â In his speech in the ÃlysÃ©e Palace, Mr Kenny stressed the importance of the digital economy. âIâd like to emphasise the enormous potential of the digital economy,â he said, quoting an EU Commission report saying it grows âat seven times the rate of the rest of the economy.â The last EU Council talked about âcreating a digital single marketâ and acknowledged that information and communication technology could create 900,000 jobs by 2015, Mr Kenny continued. âUpskilling our young jobseekers to fill in demand digital roles is a win-win for the EU economy. It will kick-start young careers. It will spawn new fast-growing tech companies.â Joan Burton placed the emphasis elsewhere, on learning from the experience of Austria - âsmall like usâ - and Germany, which have the lowest youth unemployment in the EU. She praised their âdual systemâ where training and education are combined with on-the-job work experience. Asked if the recent cut in the jobseekerâs allowance, from â¬188 to â¬ 100 a week, indicated a shortfall in funds for Irelandâs 65,000 unemployed young people, Ms Burton said training, education and in-work experience were âa much better investmentâ¦ rather than have young people shifting onto the dole and being left there without much hope for themselves or their family.â Comments are closed for this article.
Klinsmann issues Lehmann warning Klinsmann issues Lehmann warning Germany coach Jurgen Klinsmann has warned goalkeeper Jens Lehmann he may have to quit Arsenal to keep his World Cup dreams alive. Lehmann is understudy to Oliver Kahn in the German squad, but has lost his place to Manuel Alumnia at Highbury. Klinsmann said: "It will be difficult for any of our players if he is not a first-choice at his club. "If Jens is not Arsenal's number one keeper, that is a problem for me. He must be playing regularly." Lehmann is desperate to keep his place in the Germany squad when the country hosts the World Cup in 2006. Klinsmann added: "If he is not playing regularly he cannot be Germany's number one keeper, or even number two keeper. "The situation for Jens is that he is currently the number two keeper at Arsenal. This could be critical if it remains the same during next season." Return to results
Lennon brands Rangers favourites Lennon brands Rangers favourites Celtic's Neil Lennon admits Rangers could be considered "slight favourites" for the Old Firm CIS Cup clash, but insists his side can still win. Lennon concedes Rangers are in good form at the moment, but they have failed to beat Celtic in their last seven meetings. "Rangers are on the up and have been on a good run in recent weeks," he said. "But it's a game we believe we're capable of winning if we play our best," he told the Evening Times. "All the boys are looking forward to it because they are brilliant games to be involved in. "Without playing at the top of our game, we have still been winning matches. "At the minute, we are at the top of the league and still in with a chance of staying in Europe, so I don't think it is the crisis people have been trying to make out. "Of course, it is a concern when you are losing goals, because we have been notorious for being a team that is hard to beat and keeping clean sheets, but hopefully we are over that wee run. "Considering we lost Henrik Larsson at the end of last season, we have still been scoring a lot of goals, which is pleasing." Comments are closed for this article.
Letterkenny General Hospital: Doctor suspended Letterkenny General Hospital: Doctor suspended A doctor at Letterkenny General Hospital has been suspended following allegations that a child was physically assaulted in recent days. The hospital confirmed an investigation is taking place, but did not divulge specific details of the incident. However, it is believed that the doctor is alleged to have struck a four-year-old child. It is understood the alleged incident was witnessed by one of the childâs parents and the matter was reported to hospital management. A spokesman for the hospital, part of the West/North Hospitals Group, confirmed it is investigating a âtrust in careâ incident. âLetterkenny General Hospital (part of the West/North West Hospitals Group) is investigating a âtrust in careâ incident concerning a child who was attending the hospital, accompanied by its parent. âLetterkenny General Hospital is guided by two policies when dealing with such incidents. Best practice âThe âChildren Firstâ policy states that the key principles informing best practice are that the welfare of children is of paramount importance and that all personnel and health professionals, irrespective of the position held within the organisation, have a responsibility towards child protection and welfare.â The spokesman said the âTrust in Careâ policy aims to ensure any allegations or complaints against a member of staff are thoroughly investigated. This policy states that âat an appropriate stage in the process, management should take whatever protective measures are necessary to ensure that no patient/client or staff member is exposed to unacceptable riskâ.

Longer-term effects of health cuts are unknown but will be profound Longer-term effects of health cuts are unknown but will be profound Latest OECD figures show State has suffered sharp drop in health spending Unsurprisingly, countries hit hardest by the economic crisis have witnessed the biggest cuts in health expenditure growth. Greece and Ireland experienced the sharpest declines, with per capita healthcare spending falling by 11.1 per cent and 6.6 per cent, respectively, between 2009 and 2011. The latest OECD report into the health of people in its 34 member countries is especially interesting as it includes data on how health systems have evolved during the economic crisis. Health at a Glance 2013 is a mine of comparative information on patient outcomes, health expenditure and health system staffing across the countries. Unsurprisingly, countries hit hardest by the economic crisis have witnessed the biggest cuts in health expenditure growth. Greece and Ireland experienced the sharpest declines, with per capita healthcare spending falling by 11.1 per cent and 6.6 per cent, respectively, between 2009 and 2011. The short-term impact has been both good and bad. Suicide rates have risen sharply in some countries, while in Greece the infant mortality rate, long held to be a reliable âmarkerâ for the quality of a stateâs health system, has begun to creep up. But other health indicators tell a different story. For example, mortality from road traffic incidents, including in Ireland, has declined. Such deaths had already been steadily falling in most OECD countries, but the rate of decline accelerated after 2008 in some countries that were hard hit by the recession. The most likely explanation for this is that less economic activity means fewer cars on the roads, and therefore fewer incidents. Alcohol and tobacco consumption in a number of countries has fallen in the immediate aftermath of the crisis. Ireland continues to have a below-average numbers of doctors practising per 1,000 people. Along with Canada, New Zealand, Chile and the Netherlands, we have the lowest number of obstetricians and gynaecologists per 100,000 women across the OECD. This shortage emerged as a factor requiring urgent remedy in the Hiqa report into the death last year of Savita Halappanavar from sepsis. Patient safety The OECD report rather optimistically states that âcountries can make further gains in patient safety, thereby reducing costs and health burdens associated with adverse eventsâ. But with health spending continuing to fall, how is this to be achieved in places like Ireland, Portugal and Greece? We have the third highest hospital bed occupancy across the OECD, with only Israel and Norway worse off. The real question remains: how will continuing cuts impact in the medium term on areas such as cancer care and mental health? .

Markets surprised as ECB cuts interest rate to record low Markets surprised as ECB cuts interest rate to record low The move sent the euro to a seven-week low against the dollar Mario Draghi, president of the European Central Bank (ECB), gestures during a news conference at the bankâs headquarters in Frankfurt. The European Central Bank cut its benchmark interest rate to a record low of 0.25 per cent yesterday, taking markets by surprise and providing a welcome boost to homeowners across the euro zone. The move sent the euro to a seven-week low against the dollar, while euro zone government bond yields surged as the interest-rate cut boosted the demand for fixed-income assets. In a boost to banks the refinance rate was also cut by a quarter of a percentage point to 0.75 per cent, while the deposit interest rate remains unchanged at 0 per cent. Addressing journalists after the rate-setting decision, ECB president Mario Draghi hinted that further cuts could be on the table. âWe have a whole range of instrument to activate before reaching the lower bound... in principle we could even cut further the interest rate,â he said, adding that the current trend of low inflation would extend for âsome period of timeâ. The decision to cut rates was in line with the bankâs forward guidance in July, Mr Draghi said, in light of the further diminishing underlying price pressures in the euro area. The ECB also committed to continue its offering of one-month and three-month cash until early July 2015, providing more liquidity to the banking system. Asked whether the bank would consider quantitative easing, he said a number of options were available before quantitative easing would be considered. Most analysts believe that the ECB is still unlikely to engage in quantitative easing despite the fact that its options are narrowing as interest rates approach close to zero. Asked whether the recent strength of the euro was a factor in yesterdayâs decision, Mr Draghi said that exchange rates were ânot a policy targetâ and played no role in the decision. Pressure to act The ECB had been under pressure to act at yesterdayâs rate-setting meeting following weak economic figures over the last few weeks, most notably a sharp drop in inflation in October. However, virtually all analysts had expected a decision to be postponed until next month. Minister for Finance Michael Noonan welcomed the interest rate move. âWe wanted interest rates to go down and it helps our position going back into the markets because the spreads in Europe should narrow now. The interest rate reduction and the suggestion that the currency level might go down a little would both help our exports and help our economy to grow.â .

Maternity care concerns raised in Savita report Maternity care concerns raised in Savita report Report points to 13 âmissed opportunitiesâ that could have saved Ms Halappanavar Significant deficiencies in the care of critically ill women in the Stateâs 19 maternity hospitals have been identified in a report on the death of Savita Halappanavar . The report by the Health Information and Quality Authority points to 13 âmissed opportunitiesâ that, had they been identified and acted upon, could have resulted in a different outcome for Ms Halappanavar, who died in University Hospital Galway last October. While restating criticisms of the clinical management of Ms Halappanavar made in an earlier Health Service Executive report and at the coronerâs inquest, the Hiqa report casts its net more widely by identifying shortcomings in maternity care generally and calling for a national review of maternity services. The report says: âUltimate clinical accountability rested with the consultant obstetrician who was leading Savita Halappanavarâs care.â Minister for Health James Reilly last night promised to ensure that the recommendations of all three reports were fully implemented, while the HSE said it was appointing a senior official to oversee this work. Ms Halappanavarâs husband Praveen regards the report as a vindication of his account of her death, his solicitor Gerard OâDonnell said. The Hiqa report found there were âquestions as to the sustainability of the provision of maternity services in some areasâ. The report reveals that Hiqa wrote to the HSE twice in recent months to express concern about issues which they said could pose serious risks to the health of pregnant women whose clinical situation was deteriorating. Thirteen of the 19 maternity hospitals have no high-dependency beds for maternity patients and none has critical care beds, Hiqa pointed out to HSE director general Tony OâBrien in July. The letter raised concerns about limitations in the provision of critical care to obstetric patients through neighbouring acute hospitals, particularly in HSE Dublin North East. The authority raised further concerns in August with Mr OâBrien, who gave assurances about services in most hospitals. But the report says Hiqa remains concerned that assurances are not in place in all hospitals, though it notes the HSEâs commitment for this to happen imminently. Phelim Quinn, Hiqaâs director of regulation, said the investigation findings reflected a failure in the provision of the most basic elements of patient care to Ms Halappanavar. Mr Quinn said there were âdisturbing resemblancesâ between Ms Halappanavarâs case and that of Tania McCabe, who died in hospital in Drogheda in 2007 after her membranes ruptured. It was âsimply unacceptableâ that, six years on from the report into Ms McCabeâs death, only five of the 19 public maternity hospitals could provide a detailed status report on the implementation of those recommendations. âI donât believe any doctor, any midwife, any nurse ever wants to stand by and watch a patient die, but if you donât have the correct knowledge, the correct support services, the correct guidelines and protocols in place to help and guide clinical care things like this are going to happen,â UK-based anaesthetist Nuala Lucas , a member of the Hiqa investigation team, said. There was evidence of inadequate staffing in UHG and across the maternity services, she added. A special board meeting of the West/Northwest Hospitals Group, which includes UHG, will take place next week to consider the findings of the three reports into Ms Halappanavarâs death. Bill Maher, chief executive of the group, said considerable progress had already been made in implementing recommendations, including an early warning score system, staff education on sepsis and improved communications on doctorsâ handovers. Mr Maher apologised to Mr Halappanavar. Ms Halappanavar was 17 weeks pregnant when she died from sepsis on October 28th last year following a miscarriage. Return to results
Medical card check shows thousands ineligible Medical card check shows thousands ineligible High level of excess payment found in system where cardholderâs circumstances improve The report says there is a high level of excess payment in the medical card system where a cardholderâs financial circumstances change after being granted a card. Photograph: Alan Betson/The Online News Just 68 per cent of medical cardholders were deemed as eligible to hold medical cards last year after a review when they came up for renewal, according to the comptroller and auditor generalâs report. Large numbers of cardholders were found to have died, become ineligible or did not respond when contacted by HSE officials, according to a chapter in the report on medical cards. Cardholders who were allowed self-assess at time of renewal were more likely to find themselves eligible compared to those fully reviewed by the HSE. The report says there is a high level of excess payment in the medical card system where a cardholderâs financial circumstances change after being granted a card. Although it doesnât put a figure on this overpayment, it cites a 2011 report which estimated the potential exposure at between â¬65 million and â¬210 million. Self-assessment Self-assessment was applied in the review of 256,200 cases, of which 226,200 were found to be eligible. It says the HSE has not begun legal proceedings against a single person in relation to false declarations or a failure to notify a change in circumstances. There is no legal basis for recovering âirregular paymentsâ made by the HSE on behalf of a cardholder. The report says a particular data protection issue was identified during checking, in that the Revenue Commissioner says they cannot provide the HSE with information about spouses. This issue reduces the usefulness of Revenue data in detecting ineligibility, it says. Officials from the comptrollerâs office looked at a sample of 50 people who had been approved for medical cards and found the vast majority satisfied the criteria for eligibility. However, in two cases, the cards were issued in error and in another two cases, the documentary evidence on file was inadequate. Discretionary costs In another three cases, discretionary costs such as medical costs were taken into consideration in assessing eligibility. GP reports were accepted as the main form of evidence but these did not always specify the number of doctor visits or the cost of medication. Where a person is refused a medical card because income exceeds the set limits, he or she can still apply for a discretionary card on hardship grounds. Officials reviewed 25 of these applications and found that in a majority of cases, the cards were awarded on the basis of significant medical expenditure. Cards are normally issued for three years (four where the person is over 66), but officials found that some people had been issued cards with an eligibility period of more than 20 years. Out of two million cardholders, just 22 people contacted the HSE last year to surrender cards because their circumstances had changed. The report says the HSE should review the controls in place and provide staff with more specific guidelines for approving cards.

Medical staff âfailed to actâ as Savitaâs condition worsened Medical staff âfailed to actâ as Savitaâs condition worsened Third and final report into pregnant womanâs death identifies failures in basic patient care The 250-page report from HIQA into the death of Savita Halappanavar in University Hospital Galway last year makes a large number of recommendations on maternity services, both national and specific to the hospital. Photograph: The Online News A new report into the death of Savita Halappanavar has found there was a failure to provide her with the most basic element of patient care and a failure to recognise and act upon signs of her clinical diagnosis in University Hospital Galway last year. The report by the Health Information and Quality Authority points to a number of âmissed opportunitiesâ which, had they been identified and acted upon, could have saved her life. Nationally, it warns that maternity services may, on occasion, not be as safe as they should be, or of sufficient quality. The report says this must be addressed as a matter of urgency and it calls on the HSE and the Department of Health to immediately undertake a review of maternity services. Summary It says the consultant obstetrician, non-consultant hospital doctors and midwives/nurses caring for Ms Halappanavar did not appear to act in a timely way in response to her clinical deterioration and identifies a failure to act or escalate concerns to âan appropriately qualified clinicianâ. Ms Halappanavar, who was 17 weeks pregnant, died in the hospital of sepsis last October 28th following a miscarriage. The Hiqa report says the recommended four-hourly observations of her temperature, heart rate and blood pressure did not appear to have been carried out at the required intervals. It also pointed to a failure to follow up on blood tests for Ms Halappanavar. âThe consultant, NCHDs and midwifery/nursing staff were responsible and accountable for ensuring that Savita Halappanavar received the right care at the right time,â according to the report. âHowever, this did not happen.â It says the most senior clinical decision maker involved in the provision of care to Ms Halappanavar at any given time should have been suitable clinically experienced and competent to interpret clinical findings and act accordingly. âUltimate clinical accountability rested with the consultant obstetrician who was leading Savita Halappanavarâs care.â In addition, the clinical governance arrangements within the hospital failed to recognise that vital hospital policies were not in use, nor were arrangements in place to ensure the provision of basic patient care on St Monicaâs Ward, where Ms Halappanavar was accommodated. The report points out that UHG had developed a local Modified Obstetric Early Warning Score (MOEWS) chart in 2009 but this was not in use on the ward three years later, in October 2012. It says there was no formal clinical escalation protocol and no emergency response team in place at the hospital and while sepsis guidelines were in place, clinical governance arrangements were ânot robust enoughâ to ensure they were adhered to. The report says it is critically important that the health service learns from mistakes, including this tragic event. However, it points out there is a âdisturbing resemblanceâ between the case of Ms Halappanavar and that of Tania McCabe and her son Zach, who died in 2007. There are 34 recommendations in the report, starting with a call for their full implementation. In addition, it says the HSE and the Department of Health must as a priority review maternity services nationally. The 250-page report from the Health Information and Quality Authority is the third report into the death of Ms Halappanavar in University Hospital Galway last year, and follows a coronerâs inquest and an inquiry by the HSE. The long-awaited report was presented to the Hiqa board on Monday evening and a copy was furnished to Minister for Health James Reilly yesterday. Ms Halappanavarâs husband Praveen, who did not cooperate with the inquiry, is also being furnished with a copy of the report through his solicitor. The terms of reference of the Hiqa report were ââto investigate the safety, quality and standards of services provided by the HSE to patients, including pregnant women, at risk of clinical deterioration, including those provided in University Hospital Galway (UHG) and as reflected in, among other things, the care and treatment provided to Savita Halappanavarâ. Dr Reilly again expressed his sincere sympathy to the Halappanavar family for theloss of Savita. âThis tragedy should not have happened. The untimely death of Savita Halappanavar on 28th October last year was a shocking wake-up call to the whole healthcare system about how failures in patientsâ care can sometimes have extreme consequences.â He said:âI am determined that out of the sad loss of this young woman our whole health system will learn lessons that will ensure that it provides safe, patient-centred care.â The Minister also said he would ensure that the report would be given careful consideration and reflection to ensure all of its findings and recommendations are responded to.

Michelle McDonagh Michelle McDonagh Walking briskly for 30 minutes or more five days a week is one of the main predictors for wellbeing and prevention of low mood during pregnancy, new research from University College Dublin has found. Pregnancy is a period during which wellbeing often declines and there is increased anxiety and stress. There is a higher prevalence of depression, both during pregnancy and post-partum, which may be due to hormonal changes compounded by stress, physical limitations and environmental factors. Professor of Obstetrics and Gynaecology at UCD School of Medicine and consultant, Fionnuala McAuliffe, explained that wellbeing has been linked to quality of diet and lifestyle in adults, however there is a lack of data in pregnancy. The aim of her study was to examine the relationship between wellbeing and socioeconomic status, diet and lifestyle during pregnancy and to consider the effect of intervention with low glycaemic index (GI) diet on measures of well being. The study, which was funded by the Health Research Board under the EU FP7 framework, analysed 700 women in the first half of pregnancy. The principal findings of the research was that the main predictors of wellbeing were third-level education and physical activity. The low GI diet intervention group had a significantly lower impact on wellbeing than education and activity. Due to the relatively short duration of pregnancy, educational attainment may be looked at as non-modifiable at this time, the authors noted, and simply recognised as a risk factor for reduced wellbeing. Prof McAuliffe announced her latest research findings at the HRB Centre and Health and Diet Research conference in University College Cork last week. The conference marked the first five years of the Centreâs work and set the stage for the next phase of funding. She said: âThere may not be a lot a woman can do about her education level in the short- term, but I am very excited by the finding that those who walk 30 minutes a day for five days have better health and wellbeing than those who donât. Itâs such a simple thing to do. Low mood in pregnancy is a big issue, but the women who walked as recommended were not only fitter and healthier but reported in better mood than those in the control group.â She said only 20 per cent of women achieved the recommendations of 30 minutes of brisk walking five times a week. She said her findings had significance for both women at risk of low mood and for healthcare professionals when counselling pregnant women about the importance of healthy lifestyle in pregnancy.

Middlesbrough 2-2 Charlton Middlesbrough 2-2 Charlton A late header by teenager Danny Graham earned Middlesbrough a battling draw with Charlton at the Riverside. Matt Holland had put the visitors ahead in the 14th minute after his shot took a deflection off Franck Queudrue. But Middlesbrough peppered the Charlton goal after the break and Chris Riggott stroked home the equaliser. Shaun Bartlett's strike put Charlton back in front but that lead lasted just six minutes before Graham rushed onto Queudrue's pass to head home. The match burst to life from the whistle and Charlton defender Hermann Hreidarsson had sight of an open goal after just six minutes. Hreidarsson received Danny Murphy's free-kick from the right but he crashed his free header wide of the far post. The Iceland international looked such a danger the Boro bench could be heard issuing frantic instructions to mark him. Charlton's early pressure paid off when Bartlett received a long ball from Talal El Karkouri in the box and laid it off to Holland who buried his right-footed strike. Szilard Nemeth, recalled in place of Joseph-Desire Job, was twice denied his chance to get Middlesbrough back on level terms by Dean Kiely. The striker played a great one-two with Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink only to see Kiely get down well to smother his shot before directing a header straight into the keeper's arms. Boro had plenty of time on the ball but the Addicks comfortably mopped up the pressure - with Kiely tipping a Hasselbaink header over the bar - to take their lead into half-time. It was all one-way traffic after the break at the Riverside as Middlesbrough poured forward and Kiely even saved Hreidarsson's blushes when he palmed the ball away to prevent a Charlton own goal. But the Addicks keeper could do nothing about Riggott's equaliser in the 74th minute. The Boro defender looked suspiciously offside as he got on the end of Gareth Southgate's misdirected effort, but despite the Charlton protests his goal stood. The Addicks did not let their heads drop and Bartlett left the Boro defence standing, picking up Hreidarsson's cross to easily sink his right-footed strike. But substitute Graham was on hand to grab a share of the points for the home side. The 19-year-old striker nodding home the equaliser - and his first Premiership goal - with five minutes left on the clock. "I felt we did enough to win the game even though the first half was lacklustre. "We dominated after the break, the players showed a fantastic response and we should have gone on to win. "But for (Charlton goalkeeper) Dean Kiely, who made three tremendous saves, we could have scored five or six." "To take the lead and then to get penned back, it feels a little bit like a defeat," admitted Kiely. "We were winning but Middlesbrough kept knocking on the door. But we stood up and credit to us we didn't capitulate. "We'll kick on now. Our short-term ambition is to progress from the seventh place finish from last year."

Millions buy MP3 players in US Millions buy MP3 players in US One in 10 adult Americans - equivalent to 22 million people - owns an MP3 player, according to a survey. A study by the Pew Internet and American Life Project found that MP3 players are the gadget of choice among affluent young Americans. The survey did not interview teenagers but it is likely that millions of under-18s also have MP3 players. The American love affair with digital music players has been made possible as more and more homes get broadband. Of the 22 million Americans who own MP3 players, 59% are men compared to 41% of women. Those on high income - judged to be $75,000 (Â£39,000) or above - are four times more likely to have players than those earning less than $30, 000 ( Â£15,000). Broadband access plays a big part in ownership too. Almost a quarter of those with broadband at home have players, compared to 9% of those who have dial-up access. MP3 players are still the gadget of choice for younger adults. Almost one in five US citizens aged under 30 have one. This compares to 14% of those aged 30-39 and 14% of those aged 40-48. The influence of children also plays a part. Sixteen percent of parents living with children under 18 have digital players compared to 9% of those who don't. The ease of use and growth of music available on the net are the main factors for the upsurge in ownership, the survey found. People are beginning to use them as instruments of social activity - sharing songs and taking part in podcasting - the survey found. "IPods and MP3 players are becoming a mainstream technology for consumers" said Lee Rainie, director of the Pew Internet and American Life Project. "More growth in the market is inevitable as new devices become available, as new players enter the market, and as new social uses for iPods/MP3 players become popular," he added. Return to results
Minister accepts process that closed acute unit in Ballinasloe Minister accepts process that closed acute unit in Ballinasloe Psychiatrists accuse HSE West of discussing closing one of three acute mental health units after it had already taken decision to shut Ballinasloe unit Kathleen Lynch: has ruled out an independent review into a HSE West decision to shut down the new â¬2.8 million acute mental health unit Ciaran Tierney The Minister of State for Health has ruled out the possibility of an independent review into a HSE West decision to shut down a new â¬2.8 million acute mental health unit in Co Galway . Kathleen Lynch said she accepted the âpoints systemâ used to favour an older facility at Roscommon County Hospital over the new 22-bed unit at St Brigidâs Hospital, Ballinasloe , which was only completed in July of this year. The decision to close the unit led to several hundred people protesting in Ballinasloe to support the East Galway Mental Health Action Group campaign to keep it open. Decision Senior consultant psychiatrists have also accused HSE West management of discussing the possibility of closing one of the three acute mental health units in Galway and Roscommon with them after they had already taken the decision to shut down the unit in Ballinasloe. The East Galway consultants, Dr Margaret OâGrady, Dr Sabina Fahy and Dr Eugene Macken , were briefed by management in relation to a staffing crisis at the inpatient units in early July, when they were told nursing agency staff could not be employed. âManpower efficienciesâ âWith reluctance it was suggested that perhaps the time had come to look at locating the beds in two acute units, as opposed to three, to create manpower efficiencies,â the three psychiatrists said in a letter to local media this week. âIt was agreed that the scoring process should proceed. At this stage, we in east Galway were unaware that the scoring process had already been completed and that a decision had been made to close the acute beds in Ballinasloe.â The consultants have expressed their concerns to the national director for Mental Health Services, the chief executive of the HSE, Minister for Health James Reilly and the chief executive of the Mental Health Commission .

Minister says profitable health insurers can accept lower profits on policies for younger customers Minister says profitable health insurers can accept lower profits on policies for younger customers Minister for Health James Reilly suggested today that some health insurers were âcherry-pickingâ customers and as a result had lower proportion of older customers than their market share. Photograph: TheOnline News Minister for Health James Reilly has called on insurers to absorb the cost of stamp duty increases and not add them to the health cover premiums of younger people. Yesterday Dr Reilly announced a number of rule changes announced which, coupled with budget reductions in tax relief on premiums, are expected to see premiums increase by approximately 15 per cent. An average family with two children will pay an extra â¬328 in premiums next year as a result of yesterdayâs change and the budget cuts in tax relief, insurer GloHealth estimated. Laya healthcare added that the move would drive more people out of private health insurance. Speaking today Dr Reilly said an average of 60,000 people per annum had abandoned their private health insurance and admitted that in the longer term this was unsustainable. He called on insurers to accept a lower profit margin on their younger, healthier customers and not to pass on the increases to this age group in a bid to prevent them surrendering their policies. Dr Reilly suggested that some insurers were âcherry-pickingâ customers and as a result had a far lower proportion of older customers than their market share. Dr Reilly said VHI had only 55 per cent of the private health insurance market but 80 per cent of the payouts, largely because it had a disproportionally high proportion of elderly customers, and that this was unsustainable. He said the changes were being introduced to protect older people and keep health insurance affordable for them. Fianna FÃ¡il leader Micheal Martin told the DÃ¡il today up to 6,000 people are cancelling their private health insurance each month. âBy the end of this year, in two years alone, we estimate that about 140,000 people will have cancelled health insurance,ââ he added. He claimed that Government policies were driving people out of private health insurance. Laya managing director DÃ³nal Clancy said ârather than protect the most vulnerable patients as outlined by the Minister, the levy hike will only increase the burden on an already struggling public health systemâ. He said the health levy has risen by 149 per cent for an adult since its introduction in 2009 with the rate for children rising 155 per cent. The duty, which is used to fund credits to the various insurers according to the age profile of their customers, is being increased from â¬350 to â¬399 per adult with advanced cover, and â¬120 to â¬135 per child. The change will affect more than 80 per cent of customers who have advanced cover for private and public hospitals. The VHI will benefit most from the changes to credits because it has the highest proportion of older customers. The three privately owned insurers will be hardest hit because their customer base is younger. Dr Reilly said he was reluctant to recommend increases in stamp duty, given the pressures many households face. âHowever, my priority is to direct support where it is most needed and these revised risk equalisation credits will subsidise health insurance for our most vulnerable patients,â he said. GloHealth chief executive Jim Dowdall said: âIt is farcical, bizarre and absurd that the Minister continually calls on health insurers to drive down costs when Government policies have been the overwhelming driver of rising premiums in recent years.â Risk equalisation is the system whereby companies with older customers with higher claims costs are compensated by rivals with a younger client case. Dermot Goode of Cornmarket Healthcare Division said the changes announced by the Minister would have an inflationary effect even though the stamp duty was not levied on consumers, because insurers were likely to pass on the increases. âConsumers are going to get clobbered. Between this and the cuts in tax relief announced in last monthâs budget, itâs likely that premium increases of between 10 and 15 per cent are coming down the line,â he said. Insurances companies are also under pressure to fund an extra â¬30 million a year being demanded by the Department of Health from next year in respect of the use by private patients of public beds in the public health system, he said. Mr Goode estimated that the budget changes added up to â¬270 a year to the cost of the VHIâs Plan B Options policy, and â¬170 to Plan B. Customers on âgold-platedâ plans, as they were called by Minister for Finance Michael Noonan in his budget-day speech, will have to pay an extra â¬470-â¬780 a year. .

Minister says promise in Programme for Govenment unlikely to be achieved Minister says promise in Programme for Govenment unlikely to be achieved Kathleen Lynch: said she did not believe free GP care would be made available beyond under-fives in the lifetime of the Government but that if the Government were re-elected it would be implemented in a second term. Photograph: Bryan OâBrien A Labour Minister has admitted that a key policy promise in the Programme for Government, the introduction of free GP care for all by 2016, is now unlikely to be achieved. Minister of State at the Department of Health Kathleen Lynch said she didnât believe free GP care would be made available beyond under-fives in the lifetime of the Government, but that if the Government were re-elected, it would be implemented in a second term. Contradicted Her admission was immediately contradicted by the other Labour Minister of State at the department, Alex White , who has responsibility for primary care. He said the commitment was to implement free GP care for all âduring this Governmentâs term of officeâ. This promise had been repeated by the Taoiseach and other Ministers on numerous occasions, he pointed out. Speaking on This Week on RTÃ Radio yesterday, Ms Lynch was asked whether it was unfair to extend free GP care to all under-5s, regardless of means, when needy older people were being deprived of benefits. She replied that free GP care for under-5s was a good idea: âI would hope that in the lifetime of this Government and maybe if weâre re-elected, the next time round we will be able to extend that because access to a GP is the best way to operate your health serviceâ. Asked later by The Online News to clarify her remark, Ms Lynch said the Government was âhopingâ to extend free GP care beyond the under-5s âbut I wouldnât be certain it will happen in this termâ. The Programme for Government states: âUniversal Primary Care will remove fees for GP care and will be introduced within this Governmentâs term of officeâ. The document commits the Government to introducing the policy in phases so that additional doctors, nurses and other healthcare professionals can be recruited. The programme originally envisaged that in the first year of Government access to primary care without fees would first be extended to people on the long-term illness scheme. Target not achieved However, this target was not achieved and it later emerged there were legal difficulties with the allocation of resources on the basis of medical needs rather than means. Mr White was charged with coming up with a new way of implementing the overall policy and proposed the plan to start extending free GP care by age category, starting with young children. Minister for Health James Reilly announced details of the measure on budget day, when he said 240,000 children would benefit at a cost of â¬37 million a year. The plan requires primary legislation so it is unlikely that free GP care for under-5s will be introduced by late next year at the earliest. Comments are closed for this article.
Most NI firms optimistic about 2014, research finds Most NI firms optimistic about 2014, research finds More than half of businesses contacted had recruited extra staff this year Lisneyâs 2013 Northern Ireland commercial property report shows transaction volumes âhave seen a sixfold increase since 2011â. Photograph: Cyril Byrne/The Online News Seven out of 10 firms in the North say they are optimistic about prospects for 2014, according to the latest economic research, suggesting a more positive business environment is emerging. The research, conducted on behalf of Bank of Ireland , shows that more than half of the businesses contacted had recruited additional staff this year and 58 per cent were planning to hire next year. Almost 60 per cent of local companies said their businesses were stable, although 17 per cent described their operations as simply âsurvivingâ. The findings reinforce separate research from Ulster Bank earlier this week, which highlighted that improving business conditions had contributed to an increase in the number of people in work in the North. The Ulster Bank PMI report suggested that employment was growing at a pace not seen since August 2007 as the local private sector enjoyed âsolid risesâ in output and new orders. House prices The upbeat business outlook is reflected in the latest house- price survey, also published this week, which suggests prices are stabilising. The RICS and Ulster Bank housing market survey for Northern Ireland claims October was the fifth successive month that prices improved. Commercial property agents claim there are signs of recovery in the investment, office and industrial sectors. Lisneyâs 2013 Northern Ireland commercial property report shows transaction volumes âhave seen a sixfold increase since 2011â. Its latest report says that the total value of assets sold, under offer or brought to market in 2013 is more than Â£150 million (â¬178 million), almost double the value achieved just 12 months ago.

Most governments unprepared as G8 set to meet to discuss responses Most governments unprepared as G8 set to meet to discuss responses In Britain, dementia is the most feared health condition among people aged over 55. Photo: iStock Many governments are woefully unprepared for an epidemic of dementia currently affecting 44 million people worldwide and set to more than treble to 135 million people by 2050, health experts and campaigners said today. Fresh estimates from the advocacy group Alzheimerâs Disease International (ADI) showed a 17 per cent increase in the number of people with the incurable mind-robbing condition compared with 2010, and warned that by 2050 more than 70 per cent of dementia sufferers will be living in poorer countries. âItâs a global epidemic and it is only getting worse,â said ADIâs executive director Marc Wortmann . âIf we look into the future the numbers of elderly people will rise dramatically. Itâs vital that the World Health Organization makes dementia a priority, so the world is ready to face this condition.â Alzheimerâs, the most common form of dementia, is a fatal brain disease that has no cure and few effective treatments. Like other forms of the disorder, it affects patientsâ memory, thinking and behaviour and is an increasingly overwhelming burden on societies and economies. While there are a few drugs that can ease some symptoms in some people, there is no cure. Even now, the global cost of dementia care is more than $600 billon (â¬441 billion), or around 1.0 per cent of global gross domestic product (GDP), and that will only increase, the ADI says. In a policy report published along with the new data, Martin Prince , a professor at Kingâs College Londonâs Institute of Psychiatry, said âmost governments are woefully unprepared for the dementia epidemicâ. His report said only 13 countries have national dementia plans. âThis is a global problem that is increasingly impacting on developing countries with limited resources and little time to develop comprehensive systems of social protection, health and social care,â Prof Prince said in a statement. Leaders from the Group of Eight (G8) industrialised countries are due to meet in London next week for a special summit on dementia - a condition that includes Alzheimerâs, vascular dementia, dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), fronto-temporal dementia and many other causes of cognitive decline. In Britain, dementia is the most feared health condition among people aged over 55 and costs the economy Â£23 billion (â¬27.7 billion) a year - more than cancer, stroke or heart disease combined. British prime minister David Cameron , who will host the summit, has committed to spending Â£66 million on dementia research by 2015. Campaigners welcome the investment, but also say it is a fraction - one eighth - of what is spent on cancer research in Britain. Experts on neurological conditions, research campaigners and charities say they are determined the summit should not be just a talking shop, but should see leaders committing to dramatically increased funds for research and drug development in dementia, and to giving it greater political attention. âLack of funding means dementia research is falling behind other conditions,â said Jeremy Hughes , chief executive of the Alzheimerâs Society. âThe G8 is our once-in-a-generation chance to conquer this condition and we must see meaningful action after the talking is over.â - Online News Return to results
Mourinho says race is almost over Mourinho says race is almost over Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho has said that his high-flying team are now virtually assured of winning their first Premiership title. Mourinho's side have lost just once in the Premiership, boast a 10-point lead over Arsenal and are a further point clear of Manchester United. "There is so much ground for the teams chasing us to make up," Mourinho told Chelsea TV. "If it goes from 10 to 12 or 13 points then maybe it will be over." Mourinho continued: "Could you ever imagine that with all the new players and a new coach we could be 10 clear at this stage? "Of course 10 points is 10 points, it is better than seven and it is better than five. "But if one day we lose a game or two points and the gap goes from 10 to seven or eight, we are ready to accept it as natural and keep going, controlling the distance." Mourinho took over as Chelsea manager last summer after guiding Porto to Champions League glory as well as the Portuguese league title. Chelsea have conceded just eight goals in 23 Premiership games this season and have won their last six games in the league. The gap between Cheslea and rivals Arsenal or Manchester United means the Blues would have to drop at least 10 points from their remaining 15 games if they are to be caught.

Musicians 'upbeat' about the net Musicians 'upbeat' about the net Musicians are embracing the internet as a way of reaching new fans and selling more music, a survey has found. The study by US researchers, Pew Internet, suggests musicians do not agree with the tactics adopted by the music industry against file-sharing. While most considered file-sharing as illegal, many disagreed with the lawsuits launched against downloaders. "Even successful artists don't think the lawsuits will benefit musicians," said report author Mary Madden. For part of the study, Pew Internet conducted an online survey of 2,755 musicians, songwriters and music publishers via musician membership organisations between March and April 2004. They ranged from full-time, successful musicians to artists struggling to make a living from their music. "We looked at more of the independent musicians, rather than the rockstars of this industry but that reflects more accurately the state of the music industry," Ms Madden told the Online News News website. "We always hear the views of successful artists like the Britneys of the world but the less successful artists rarely get represented." The survey found that musicians were overwhelming positive about the internet, rather than seeing it as just a threat to their livelihood. Almost all of them used the net for ideas and inspiration, with nine out of 10 going online to promote, advertise and post their music on the web. More than 80% offered free samples online, while two-thirds sold their music via the net. Independent musicians, in particular, saw the internet as a way to get around the need to land a record contract and reach fans directly. "Musicians are embracing the internet enthusiastically," said Ms Madden. "They are using the internet to gain inspiration, sell it online, tracking royalties, learning about copyright." Perhaps surprisingly, opinions about online file-sharing were diverse and not as clear cut as those of the record industry. Through the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), it has pursued an aggressive campaign through the courts to sue people suspected of sharing copyrighted music. But the report suggests this campaign does not have the wholehearted backing of musicians in the US. It found that most artists saw file-sharing as both good and bad, though most agreed that it should be illegal. "Free downloading has killed opportunities for new bands to break without major funding and backing," said one musician quoted by the report. "It's hard to keep making records if they don't pay for themselves through sales." However 60% said they did not think the lawsuits against song swappers would benefit musicians and songwriters. Many suggested that rather than fighting file-sharing, the music industry needed to recognise the changes it has brought and embrace it. "Both successful and struggling musicians were more likely to say that the internet has made it possible for them to make more money from their music, rather than make it harder for them to protect their material from piracy," said Ms Madden.

Near-record US stock market not in a bubble, says Greenspan Near-record US stock market not in a bubble, says Greenspan Former Fed chief says US economy will grow more slowly next year than expected Alan Greenspan, former Federal Reserve chairman, said the stock market is not in a bubble, even as the Dow Jones Industrial Average breached 16,000 and the Standard & Poorâs 500 has climbed above 1,800, leaving both measures at record levels. Photographer: Andrew Harrer/Online News Former US Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan said the US economy probably will grow more slowly next year than some forecasters predict and indicated that a near-record US stock market was not in a bubble. âThis does not have the characteristics, as far as Iâm concerned, of a stock market bubble,â Mr Greenspan said in an interview with Online News Television, which is due to air this weekend. âIt could come out that way but I donât see it at this stage.â Mr Greenspan said that even with the rise in equities, the US economy is restrained by a âdegree of uncertaintyâ that is reducing investment. Economists who forecast 2.5 per cent to 3 per cent growth next year may be too optimistic, he said. âItâs a little on the upside, frankly,â Mr Greenspan said. âThereâs no doubt that thereâs been some acceleration going on, but thereâs an overall suppression that is going on in the economyâ largely because of lingering uncertainty, he said. Mr Greenspan said his 2014 growth forecast is âcloser to 2 per cent.â He said the economy is being held back in part by the banking system, as some of the largest banks are not operating efficiently. âWeâre supporting banking institutions who are not only very large, but not very efficient and they are using the scarce savings of the society, which is critical for economic growth,â he said. He declined to identify which banks had become inefficient. The Standard and Poorâs 500 Index has rallied about 27 per cent this year, heading for the biggest annual gain since 1998, as the Fed has pressed on with its stimulus campaign. The S&P 500 climbed 0.2 per cent to 1,806.85 in New York yesterday, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.2 per cent to 16,097.46. Both indexes reached records this week. âThe stock price generally goes up about 7 per cent a year for the long term,â Mr Greenspan said. âIt didnât go anywhere since October 2007 and the result of that is weâre just now breaching that. We have had no growth in stock prices for years.â The S&P 500 reached 1,565.15 on October 9th, 2007, and then dropped 57 percent as the economy went through the longest and deepest recession since the Great Depression. The index didnât surpass its October 2007 peak until March of this year. Mr Greenspan also offered praise for Janet Yellen , the nominee to be the next Fed chairman. She was approved by the Senate banking committee with a vote of 14-8 on November 21st and now heads to the full Senate. Ms Yellen (67) was a governor at the Fed from 1994 to 1997 under MrGreenspan and became president of the San Francisco Fed during the final years of Mr Greenspanâs tenure, which ended in January 2006.

Net regulation 'still possible' Net regulation 'still possible' The blurring of boundaries between TV and the internet raises questions of regulation, watchdog Ofcom has said. Content on TV and the internet is set to move closer this year as TV-quality video online becomes a norm. At a debate in Westminster, the net industry considered the options. Lord Currie, chairman of super-regulator Ofcom, told the panel that protecting audiences would always have to be a primary concern for the watchdog. Despite having no remit for the regulation of net content, disquiet has increased among internet service providers as speeches made by Ofcom in recent months hinted that regulation might be an option. At the debate, organised by the Internet Service Providers' Association (ISPA), Lord Currie did not rule out the possibility of regulation. "The challenge will arise when boundaries between TV and the internet truly blur and then there is a balance to be struck between protecting consumers and allowing them to assess the risks themselves," he said. Adopting the rules that currently exist to regulate TV content or self-regulation, which is currently the practice of the net industry, will be up for discussion. Some studies suggest that as many as eight million households in the UK could have adopted broadband by the end of 2005, and the technology opens the door to TV content delivered over the net. More and more internet service providers and media companies are streaming video content on the web. BT has already set up an entertainment division to create and distribute content that could come from sources such as BSkyB, ITV and the Online News. Head of the division, Andrew Burke, spoke about the possibility of creating content for all platforms. "How risque can I be in this new age? With celebrity chefs serving up more expletives than hot dinners, surely I can push it to the limit," he said. In fact, he said, if content has been requested by consumers and they have gone to lengths to download it, then maybe it should be entirely regulation free. Internet service providers have long claimed no responsibility for the content they carry on their servers since the Law Commission dubbed them "mere conduits" back in 2002. This defence does not apply if they have actual knowledge of illegal content and have failed to remove it. The level of responsibility they have has been tested in several high-profile legal cases. Richard Ayers, portal director at Tiscali, said there was little point trying to regulate the internet because it would be impossible. Huge changes are afoot in 2005, he predicted, as companies such as the Online News offer TV content over the net. The Online News's planned interactive media player which will give surfers the chance to download programmes such as EastEnders and Top Gear will make net TV mainstream and raise a whole new set of questions, he said. One of these will be about the vast sums of money involved in maintaining the network to supply such a huge quantity of data and could herald a new digital licence fee, said Mr Ayers. As inappropriate net content, most obviously pornography viewed by children, continues to dominate the headlines, internet regulation remains a political issue said MP Richard Allan, Liberal Democrat spokesman on IT. Mr Allan thinks that the answer could lie somewhere between the cries of "impossible to regulate" and "just apply offline laws online". In fact, instead of seeing regulation brought online, the future could bring an end to regulation as we know it for all TV content. After Lord Currie departed, the panel agreed that this could be a reality and that for the internet people power is likely to reign. "If content is on-demand, consumers have pulled it up rather than had pushed to them, then it is the consumers' choice to watch it. There is no watershed on the net," said Mr Burke.

Newcastle line up Babayaro Newcastle line up Babayaro Newcastle manager Graeme Souness is closing in on signing Chelsea defender Celestine Babayaro when the transfer window reopens. Souness is bidding to bolster his defence and, according to reports, contract negotiations are at an advanced stage with the player. Babayaro has been in the Premiership since 1997 when he moved to Chelsea for Â£2.25m from Anderlecht. But the 26-year-old has been surplus to requirements this season. Souness would not be drawn on specifics over individual players. But he said: "All I can tell you is that the chairman has worked really hard in the last couple of months to try to do deals. "We have said from day one we want to strengthen, and that is what we are hoping to do in the coming weeks." Return to results
O'Leary agrees new Villa contract O'Leary agrees new Villa contract Aston Villa boss David O'Leary signed a three-and-a-half year contract extension on Thursday, securing his future at the club until summer 2008. O'Leary's future was in question, but Villa chairman Doug Ellis said he was happy to secure the deal. "David's record since his arrival in 2003 is excellent and he shares the board's amibitions in taking this club forward," he told Villa's website. "For this reason it was important we got this right." O'Leary put pen to paper after deals were sorted for his right-hand men Roy Aitken and Steve McGregor. "It was important to me Roy and Steve, an integral part of my team, should stay for the same time," O'Leary said on Thursday ahead of signing his new deal. "Someone has to try and put Aston Villa back where they should belong and I'm up for the challenge."Earlier in December, there were rumours O'Leary would quit if he is not offered a new deal before the end of the season. But he denied that, saying he was happy to take on the challenge of improving Villa's fortunes in the long term. "I want to make sure by the end of the five years I would have been in charge that Villa are achieving top six finishes in the Premiership on a regular basis," said O'Leary, who took over at Villa Park in May 2003. "But to achieve that, and take the next step forward, we do need to bring in quality players. "I would like a couple next month if at all possible to set us on the way." Meanwhile, O'Leary has rapped skipper Olof Mellberg for his comments before Sunday's derby with Birmingham. Mellberg spoke of his dislike of Villa's rivals ahead of the match, which Steve Bruce's side won 2-1. "I've had more than a quiet word with Olof. It's been said within the whole group, not as a one-to-one," he told Villa's website. "You shouldn't leave yourself open to be shot down. You shouldn't give people the chance to take cheap shots at you and he set himself up for that." Return to results
Owen determined to stay in Madrid Owen determined to stay in Madrid England forward Michael Owen has told the Online News he is happy in Spain and has no plans to quit Real Madrid to return to the Premiership in the near future. But the 25-year-old, who has spent much of his time coming off the bench in La Liga, did not rule out a return to the Premiership at some stage. "I'm pleased with the start I've made here," he told Online News Radio Five Live. "England is my country. It's definitely part of me but who knows whether, if or when I'll be playing there again." Owen, who moved to the Bernabeu from Liverpool last summer, has grabbed 11 goals for Real but has been unable to replace Raul or Ronaldo in the starting line-up. However, he said he was delighted with the way his time in Spain was going and dismissed criticism of his decision to join Real. "When I first came there was a lot of scepticism back in England, any maybe some out here," he said. "People were saying 'fourth-choice striker, what are you going there for? You'll be sat on the bench all the time'. "But as much as our press like to build it up as if I've permanently had my backside on the bench, I've played as many games as anyone else in the team this year. "For a fourth-choice striker at the start I'm more than happy with the way I've settled in." Recent speculation has linked Owen with a move back to England, with Newcastle expressing their interest, but the England striker said he is not ready to return home. He added: "I've got nothing against the Premiership, I mean that's where I first performed, that's where I made my name. "I can't keep my eyes off the Premiership on television when I'm at home." When asked if it would have to be Liverpool if he returned Owen said: "I've not really given it much thought. "I've got great memories of Liverpool. No matter what happens it'll always be a club I have fond memories of and it will always have a place in my heart. "It's very flattering to be linked to top clubs in England - I'm glad that no-one is forgetting me! "But I couldn't have wished for a better start in Madrid." - Listen to the full interview with Garry Richardson on Online News Radio Five Live's Sportsweek at 0900 GMT on Sunday.

Primary healthcare minister says shift is âcoreâ to sustainable health services Primary healthcare minister says shift is âcoreâ to sustainable health services Minister with responsibility for primary health care Alex White has said: âThe commitment in the programme for government to achieve free GP access for the entire population within the term of office of this Government will be achieved.â Photograph: Brenda Fitzsimons/The Online News Parents will be able to access free GP care for their children aged under five âsometime in the middle of next yearâ, the Minister with responsibility for primary health care Alex White has said. The measure, which will cost â¬37 million in a full year, is currently going through the Oireachtas , but no consultations have yet taken place with doctors, Mr White revealed this morning. He acknowledged that âpeople are entitled to be scepticalâ in relation to the implementation of the Governmentâs commitment to deliver free GP care for the whole population by the end of its term in the spring of 2016. However, he said there was not a healthcare system in the world that will be able to sustain itself unless the emphasis is put on primary care. âWe canât do that with the barriers of fees. âWeâre one of the few countries in the OECD that charges people to go and see their doctor.â When pressed by Sean OâRourke on RTÃ Radio Oneâs Today with Sean Rourke show as to the start date for free GP care, Mr White responded: âThe commitment in the programme for government to achieve free GP access for the entire population within the term of office of this Government will be achieved. âFor me this is core. We will not be able to sustain our health services in the future unless we do this.â Minister for Health Dr James Reilly declined to make a cast-iron commitment to the introduction of free GP care by 2016 when he was interviewed by RTÃ presenter Brian Dowling . Mr White said they had not opened discussions with GPs about the implementation of free care for the under-5s, but he was confident of success. âWe will talk to the doctors about this. Iâm sure we will have the co-operation of the doctors in this. âIt is not a question of giving any section of society a veto over Government policy. We canât do this on our own. We need the co-operation of the medical profession and I think weâll get it.â Mr White said he was not personally persuaded by the idea that the State could not introduce a ban on alcohol sponsorship of sporting events because it might stop Ireland getting the Rugby World Cup in 2023. âThere will always be another event. There will always be an another objective. I donât want to fall out with anybody in relation to that. I can understand where Minister Varadkar is coming from in relation to this issue.â When asked whether he was in favour of the return of the âholy hourâ where the pubs had to close in the afternoon, he responded: âThere was a time in the past when you think those type of rules are overly constraining. Personally, I donât think there was such a bad idea.â However, they were not in the package of measures to deal with alcohol as a public health issue, as distinct from a public order issue, for the first time. .

Progress on new internet domains Progress on new internet domains By early 2005 the net could have two new domain names. The .post and .travel net domains have been given preliminary approval by the net's administrative body. The names are just two of a total of 10 proposed domains that are being considered by the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, Icann. The other proposed names include a domain for pornography, Asia, mobile phones, an anti-spam domain and one for the Catalan language and culture. The .post domain is backed by the Universal Postal Union that wants to use it as the online marker for every type of postal service and to help co-ordinate the e-commerce efforts of national post offices. The .travel domain would be used by hotels, travel firms, airlines, tourism offices and would help such organisations distinguish themselves online. It is backed by a New York-based trade group called The Travel Partnership. Icann said its early decision on the two domains was in response to the detailed technical and commercial information the organisations behind the names had submitted. Despite this initial approval, Icann cautioned that there was no guarantee that the domains would actually go into service. At the same time Icann is considering proposals for another eight domains. One that may not win approval is a proposal to set up a .xxx domain for pornographic websites. A similar proposal has been made many times in the past. But Icann has been reluctant to approve it because of the difficulty of making pornographers sign up and use it. In 2000 Icann approved seven other new domains that have had varying degrees of success. Three of the new so-called top level domains were for specific industries or organisations such as .museum and .aero. Others such as .info and .biz were intended to be more generic. In total there are in excess of 200 domain names and the majority of these are for nations. But domains that end in the .com suffix are by far the most numerous. Return to results
Public health expert warns deferral of measure will mean continuing obesity Public health expert warns deferral of measure will mean continuing obesity âThere is no magic bullet that will resolve the crisis of epidemic levels of obesity in children and adults in a short time. This will be a long haul. We need to be innovative and flexible in our policy responses and prepared to advance by trial and error if necessary.â The Government should incentivise healthier eating options by taxing unhealthy foods in order to help combat growing obesity levels among Irish children, a leading public health specialist has urged. Prof Ivan Perry , professor of public health at University College Cork , said it was clear that media campaigns to increase knowledge and awareness of health issues were largely ineffective unless supported by public policy measures to encourage healthier options. The current proposal for a tax on sugar-sweetened drinks is one such move, said Prof Perry, who instanced the success of the plastic bag levy as a clear example of how government policy can lead to a change in peopleâs behaviour. âTo change the culture in relation to diet and obesity in childhood, we need to move on several fronts at the same time. We need to highlight the issues of childhood obesity, provide clear dietary guidelines for parents and incentivise healthier choices through taxation. âThere is no magic bullet that will resolve the crisis of epidemic levels of obesity in children and adults in a short time. This will be a long haul. We need to be innovative and flexible in our policy responses and prepared to advance by trial and error if necessary. âThe default option of the food industry - defer taxation and other measures until we are absolutely certain they will work - is a recipe for inertia and continuing high levels of obesity, diabetes and chronic disease,â he said. Prof Perry was speaking at a conference at UCC entitled Health and Diet: Public Policy and Personal Choice across the Lifecourse, to mark five years of the Health Research Board Centre for Health and Diet Research at UCC. It is estimated that poor diet, lack of exercise, excess body weight and related risk factors account for over 40 per cent of the estimated burden of disease ( suffering, disability and premature death) in Ireland based on the recently published WHO Global Burden of Disease study. Prof Perry said that in Ireland the estimated prevalence of overweight in adults is 37 per cent, with a further 24 per cent meeting current body mass index (BMI) criteria for obesity and approximately 25 per cent of children meeting current international criteria for overweight and obesity. The HRB Centre for Health & Diet Research at UCC estimated that the cost of overweight and obesity in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland for 2009 were â¬1.13 billion and â¬510 million, accounting for 2.7 per cent and 2.8 per cent of total health expenditure, respectively.

Rate of employment growth accelerates in third quarter Rate of employment growth accelerates in third quarter Unemployment fell by 12.8% or 41,700 in the year since the third quarter of last year Minister for Social Protection Joan Burton said there were still far too many people out of work, and that tackling unemployment remained the Governmentâs number one priority, but said the figures demonstrated steady progress. The rate of employment growth accelerated during the third quarter of 2013, according to the latest figures from the Central Statistics Office . There was a year-on-year increase in employment of 3.2 per cent, or 58,000, for the third quarter of this year as compared with the same quarter last year, according to the Quarterly National Household Survey results. Total employment rose to 1,899,300. The 3.2 per cent year-on-year rise compares with an increase of 1.8 per cent for the previous quarter, 1.1 per cent for the first quarter and 0.1 per cent for the last quarter of 2012. A comparable rate of increase in employment was last seen at the end of 2007, Brian Ring of the CSO told a media briefing yesterday. The household survey figures are the official or definitive labour force estimates for the Irish economy. Unemployment fell by 12.8 per cent, or 41,700 in the year since the third quarter of 2012, reducing the total number of people out of work to 282,900. The comparable percentage fall for the second quarter was 6.9 per cent. The preceding quarter recorded an even higher year-on-year rate of decline, of 9.3 per cent, but the two quarters prior to that recorded falls of 6.1 per cent and 1.1 per cent, making for a general trend towards accelerating fall-off in unemployment. Long-term jobless The numbers in long-term unemployment fell at a faster rate than did the numbers of unemployed overall, while the rise in full-time employment was greater than the rise in part-time employment. Minister for Social Protection Joan Burton said there were still far too many people out of work, and that tackling unemployment remained the Governmentâs number one priority, but said the figures demonstrated steady progress. âEspecially important is the fact that the majority of people returning to work are returning to full-time employment,â she said. David McNamara of Davy said the data provides further hard evidence the Irish economy bounced back in the second half of this year. He said he expected the strong rise in employment to drive consumer spending in the second half of this year and into 2014, causing Davy to leave its above-consensus forecasts for gross domestic product growth unchanged at 1 per cent in 2013 and 2.5 per cent in 2014. âIf anything, our current unemployment forecasts of 13.7 per cent in 2013 and 12.8 per cent in 2014 now look too pessimistic, so we would expect to revise down those estimates . . .â SME criticism Similar positive responses were issued by other observers, though Isme chief executive Mark Fielding said the increase is âneedlessly slowâ and if the Government would only listen to the owners of small and medium-sized enterprises, more jobs would be created.

Reaction from Spanish press Reaction from Spanish press England's 1-0 defeat to Spain on Wednesday dominated the back and front pages of the country's press on Thursday. Controversy was in no short supply, with racist abuse of England's black players, Wayne Rooney's petulance and England's inept performance. But what did the Spanish press make of the affair? Online News Sport looks at the reaction. There is little coverage of the racist chanting on Wednesday night's game. But AS does cover the English reaction to the pre-match comments from Spain coach Luis Aragones, who highlighted Britain's colonial past when probed about his own remarks regarding Thierry Henry in October. Journalist Guillem Balague writes: "In our country, where multi-culturalism is a new thing, we are in nappies dealing with these things, and have a naivety which makes the English nervous." Marca refers in passing to the booing of England's black players - but only after referring to the cheers of "ole" which greeted the long periods of Spanish possession. Aragones' "no comment" to questions about racism after the match is also highlighted, as Marca focuses on the Spanish coach's praise for his players. Serbia & Montenegro's 2-0 World Cup qualifying win in Belgium - which could make qualification tougher for Spain - seems to be of greater importance. Elsewhere, the Spanish media criticises its English counterparts for stoking up the racism issue. "Were there racist chants against some players? This hasn't happened in the Spanish league and Spain for many years," said Spanish Federation press officer Fernando Garrido. "So you (English reporters) should ask yourselves what you have done to contribute to all this." And Spanish daily ABC accuses English reporters of launching a witch-hunt against Aragones. "Perhaps it was because their team had played so poorly and they wanted to divert attention towards this muddled issue," the paper says. "What the boy in the Bernabeu did was odd... Rooney seemed intent to kick any Spanish player who approached him." Yet Rooney is seen only as the worst example of many England miscreants, with Gary Neville criticised for continuing the feud between Manchester United and Arsenal for his tackles on Jose Reyes. Ashley Cole's treatment of Joaquin, and a Frank Lampard foul on Reyes are also lambasted for their "ugliness". Marca's headline says it all: "Wayne Rooney se volvi&#243; loco en el Bernab&#233;u (Wayne Rooney became crazy in the Bernabeu)" Rooney's display alarms the writer, in particular three "chilling" fouls on Joaquin, Casillas and Marchena, which "could well have left them in the infirmary." And like AS, Marca criticises Gary Neville for "leaving a message on Reyes' ankle" to remind him of the Manchester United-Arsenal clash this month. Spain's first-half performance is showered with praise, with Xavi singled out as the biggest star. "Xavi did things on Wednesday which were worthy of Maradona," the paper beams, adding, "What a work-rate, what dynamism, what vision, what leadership, what a midfield player!" On a controversial evening, AS offers one seemingly undeniable viewpoint: "Spanish football players played better football than the English." More plaudits are given to the home team, with Jaime Vargas lauding the manner in which "Spain dominated England with order and quality". The paper adds: "The bad thing about Spain v England was that it lasted only 65 minutes after which a succession of changes prevented any real competition." Vargas does not mention England's two Galacticos, simply adding in a PS: "I have not forgotten to speak of Beckham and Owen. They forgot to play." Return to results
SA return to Mauritius SA return to Mauritius Top seeds South Africa return to the scene of one of their most embarrassing failures when they face the Seychelles in the Cosafa Cup next month. Last year Bafana Bafana were humbled in the first by minnows Mauritius who beat them 2-0 in Curepipe. Coach Stuart Baxter and his squad will return to Curepipe face the Seychelles in their first game of the new-look regional competition. The format of the event has been changed this year after the entry of the Seychelles, who have taken the number of participants to 13. The teams are now divided into three group of four and play knock-out matches on successive days to determine the group champions. Mauritius host the first group, and their opponents are Madagascar, the Seychelles and South Africa. Bafana Bafana play the Seychelles before Mauritius take on Madagascar in a double-header on 26 February. The two winners return to the New George V stadium the next day and the victor of the group decider advances to August's final mini-tournament. The second group will be hosted in Namibia in April. It comprises Zimbabwe, Botswana, Mozambique and the hosts. In June, former champions Zambia will host Lesotho, Malawi and Swaziland in the third group in Lusaka. The three group winners will then join title holders Angola for the last of the mini-tournaments in August, where the winners will be crowned.

Scheme to give free GP care to young children adds to inequity in system Scheme to give free GP care to young children adds to inequity in system Opinion: Universal health care is a laudable aim, but now is not the time to introduce it How can it make sense to provide free GP care to healthy young children while denying those who struggle with chronic disease the care they need and deserve? Photograph: PA The Governmentâs decision to offer free GP care to all children aged five and under in the recent budget has provoked a strong reaction. Those in favour praise the move as the first step in implementing a system of universal healthcare; for others it raises troubling issues around the principle of ensuring care is based primarily on patient need. In the current climate where medical cards are being precipitously taken away from people with established illness such as cancer and new applications for discretionary cards refused to patients with newly diagnosed motor neurone disease, the question must be asked: is it appropriate to offer free GP care to young children who do not have a chronic illness or whose parents have an income substantially above the qualifying limit used to determine medical card eligibility for the rest of the population? Add the Orwellian phrase âmedical card probityâ â used in the budget speech to describe an exercise to reduce medical card costs by â¬113 million â to the mix and it is clear the GP care policy change for children aged five and under has been made very much against the tide of cutting access to free medical care in the Republic. Having a medical card offers more than just free access to your GP and free medication (prescription charge excepted). It is the key to free care in hospital emergency departments. Without a full medical card you will not be eligible for medical equipment deemed essential for managing your illness. Medical cards give access to wheelchairs, specialist seating and other aids to independent living. And the original full medical card is needed to obtain these benefits: a âdoctor-onlyâ medical card covers the cost of seeing your family doctor and nothing else. As a measure of the inequities that already exist in the health system consider the following real cases: Adam is a six-year-old who was born with a hypoplastic left heart â a condition where the main pumping chamber of the heart is underdeveloped. Significant needs He underwent life-saving open heart surgery but suffered a stroke following his operation. He is looked after at home by his parents, but has significant needs in terms of equipment, medication and emergency care. Adam has had a medical card for a number of years, with an expiry date of August 2014. However, his parents were shocked when his card was suddenly cancelled some weeks ago. Gemma is another six-year-old with a congenital, life-long condition. She has osteogenesis imperfecta type 3, a severe form of brittle bone disease which causes frequent fractures (necessitating regular visits to the emergency department) and which has inhibited normal growth. She requires regular treatment abroad and also has significant equipment needs. Her card expires next month and has been placed under review rather than being renewed automatically. .

Spam e-mails tempt net shoppers Spam e-mails tempt net shoppers Computer users across the world continue to ignore security warnings about spam e-mails and are being lured into buying goods, a report suggests. More than a quarter have bought software through spam e-mails and 24% have bought clothes or jewellery. As well as profiting from selling goods or services and driving advertising traffic, organised crime rings can use spam to glean personal information. The Business Software Alliance (BSA) warned that people should "stay alert". "Many online consumers don't consider the true motives of spammers," said Mike Newton, a spokesperson for the BSA which commissioned the survey. "By selling software that appears to be legitimate in genuine looking packaging or through sophisticated websites, spammers are hiding spyware without consumers' knowledge. "Once the software is installed on PCs and networks, information that is given over the internet can be obtained and abused." The results also showed that the proportion of people reading - or admitting to reading - and taking advantage of adult entertainment spam e-mails is low, at one in 10. The research, which covered 6,000 people in six countries and their attitudes towards junk e-mails, revealed that Brazilians were the most likely to read spam. A third of them read unsolicited junk e-mail and 66% buy goods or services after receiving spam. The French were the second most likely to buy something (48%), with 44% of Britons taking advantage of products and services. This was despite 38% of people in all countries being worried about their net security because of the amount of spam they get. More than a third of respondents said they were concerned that spam e-mails contained viruses or programs that attempted to collect personal information. "Both industry and the media have helped to raise awareness of the issues that surround illegitimate e-mail, helping to reduce the potential financial damage and nuisance from phishing attacks and spoof websites," said William Plante, director of corporate security and fraud protection at security firm Symantec. "At the same time, consumers need to continue exercising caution and protect themselves from harm with a mixture of spam filters, spyware detection software and sound judgement."

Speech takes on search engines Speech takes on search engines A Scottish firm is looking to attract web surfers with a search engine that reads out results. Called Speegle, it has the look and feel of a normal search engine, with the added feature of being able to read out the results. Scottish speech technology firm CEC Systems launched the site in November. But experts have questioned whether talking search engines are of any real benefit to people with visual impairments. The Edinburgh-based firm CEC has married speech technology with ever-popular internet search. The ability to search is becoming increasingly crucial to surfers baffled by the huge amount of information available on the web. According to search engine Ask Jeeves, around 80% of surfers visit search engines as their first port of call on the net. People visiting Speegle can select one of three voices to read the results of a query or summarise news stories from sources such as the Online News and Online News. "It is still a bit robotic and can make a few mistakes but we are never going to have completely natural sounding voices and it is not bad," said Speegle founder Gordon Renton. "The system is ideal for people with blurred vision or for those that just want to search for something in the background while they do something else. "We are not saying that it will be suitable for totally blind people, although the Royal National Institute of the Blind (RNIB) is looking at the technology," he added. But Julie Howell, digital policy manager at the RNIB, expressed doubts over whether Speegle and similar sites added anything to blind people's experience of the web. "There are a whole lot of options like this springing up on the web and one has to think carefully about what the market is going to be," she said. "Blind people have specialised screen readers available to them which will do the job these technologies do in a more sophisticated way," she added. The site uses a technology dubbed PanaVox, which takes web text and converts it into synthesised speech. In the past speech technology has only been compatible with broadband because of the huge files it downloads but CEC says its compression technology means it will also work on slower dial-up connections. Visitors to Speegle may notice that the look and feel of the site bears more than a passing resemblance to the better known, if silent, search engine Google. Google has no connection with Speegle and the use of bright colours is simply to make the site more visible for those with visual impairments, said Mr Renton. "It is not a rip-off. We are doing something that Google does not do and is not planning to do and there is truth in the saying that imitation is the sincerest form of flattery," he said. Speegle is proving popular with those learning English in countries such as Japan and China. "The site is bombarded by people just listening to the words. The repetition could be useful although they may all end up talking like robots," said Mr Renton. Comments are closed for this article.
Sperm from Danish clinic used by 38-year-old in Dublin procedure Sperm from Danish clinic used by 38-year-old in Dublin procedure The feet of Angelaâs son, who was born in June. A 38-year-old Irish woman has spoken about her decision to become a mother through anonymous sperm donation. The woman, known only by her first name Angela, is featured in a documentary on RTÃ Radio 1, Pregnant On My Lunchbreak. It will be broadcast on Saturday and streamed online tomorrow at rte.ie/doconone. Angelaâs son was born in June this year. She speaks in the interview of accessing donor sperm from Denmark , where the donor can still remain anonymous. The Danish sperm bank Cryos , the worldâs biggest, ships sperm to over 70 countries. It has a web-based database where prospective mothers can browse through hundreds of donor profiles, not unlike shopping online. Using a login, they can search by ethnicity, eye and hair colour, height and weight. Angela chose a donor who is similar to her in looks - tall and fair. She told the programme that she always wanted a family, but was in her late thirties and had not met anybody. She considered adoption, but decided to go for anonymous sperm donation through the Repro Med clinic in Dublin, which carries out intrauterine insemination (IUI) at a cost of â¬2,800 for tests and procedures. She said the procedure, as explained to her, was âno big deal. You were practically going into your local shop and buying something. I came out of the place saying to myself, âI think Iâll do that. Itâs no big dealâ. It took the pressure off.â Dr Declan Keane , senior embryologist at the clinic, said it was the âbiggest bravest decision for anyone coming through this doorâ. The IUI procedure only takes 30 seconds. âIt is a very simple gynaecological procedure. You can relax afterwards. To everyoneâs surprise, you can head back to your normal daily routine.â The title of the documentary comes from the 10 minutes that Angela spent in the clinic being artificially inseminated. âI was back in the car and I was thinking to myself that nobody had a clue what I had just done. I just felt totally relaxed. I just continued my day and I didnât really think about it.â Angela said she was adopted herself and wanted her own âflesh and blood. For me it is something that Iâve thought about all my life - to wonder what it was like to look like somebody.â The process of artificial insemination (AI) is unregulated in Ireland , so sperm donors can be anonymous or known. In the UK it is now illegal for a sperm donor to be anonymous. Angela admitted that her decision to have an anonymous donor was something that âplays on my mindâ especially if her son looks for the identity of his father in future years. The documentary will be broadcast on RTÃ Radio 1 at 2pm on Saturday. Return to results
Taoiseach says agencies must âanswer upâ in scheduled meetings with HSE Taoiseach says agencies must âanswer upâ in scheduled meetings with HSE Minister for Health Dr James Reilly who said there is no documentation to suggest the HSE had agreed to top up payments made to Central Remedial Clinic executives. Photograph: The Online News Pamela Duncan, David McNeill Minister for Health James Reilly has said there is no documentation to suggest that the HSE agreed to top-up payments made to Central Remedial Clinic executives. âIn relation to the allegations that the HSE were aware and had agreed to this, there is no documentation to support the fact that the HSE agreed to this at any juncture,â he said. Dr Reilly said he would not set up an independent inquiry into the top ups controversy on the basis that an internal inquiry was ongoing. âI think it is important that the process I commenced last year is allowed to come to its conclusion before we start calling for inquiries. We have revealed a huge amount of information here. We are bringing transparency to the system and that transparency is now bringing accountability and that will result in a much fairer system,â he said. The Minister said that at a meeting yesterday he was briefed by the director general of the HSE, Tony OâBrien who told him that he had â17 top peopleâ in the HSE working across the Section 38 agencies, a term which encompasses voluntary hospitals and other independent health agencies which receive funding from the Department of Health . âThis issue is seen as critically important to them...there isnât one rule for one group of people and a different rule for everybody else,â he said. Mr Reilly said the Department of Health would use mechanisms available to it, including the service level agreement to ensure that pay caps are adhered to. However, he said any actions would not impact on service user. âI donât believe that the past method of dealing with situations like this, where funding was cut to the institution which hurt the individuals who are being served by that institution, is correct. Let us punish those who are in breach,â he said. Mr Reillyâs comments appear to contradict those made yesterday by a former chair of the CRC, Des Peelo , who said that two of the âvery top peopleâ in the HSE attended a meeting in 2009 at which privately-funded top-up payments for nine people in the organisation were agreed to. Speaking on Today with Sean OâRourke on RTE Radio 1 Mr Peelo said that, in a meeting held in June 2009, the HSE had agreed to fund the salaries up to the end of that year after which point the difference over and above the HSE-funded portion of the salaries would be funded privately.

Tartan Army given safety pledge Tartan Army given safety pledge Scotland fans will be able to watch the World Cup qualifier with Italy in a safe section of the San Siro - thanks to well-behaved Celtic supporters. The Scots will sit above the home fans to avoid the shower of missiles which greeted Welsh supporters two years ago. SFA security boss Willie McDougall said the good conduct of Celtic fans earlier this season was a contributing factor. "That night, plus the record of the Tartan Army, meant they (Italy chiefs) were willing to accommodate," he said. "Our fans will be in the second and third tiers but not beneath the Italians, which caused so much trouble in that Wales match. "We will have 10,000 tickets which may extend to 13,000. They will be section two and three in the stadium behind the goals." McDougall told the Daily Record: "We had a meeting on Friday and the local police were there along with the national police and members of the Italian FA. "And they all said how impressed they were with the Celtic fans' behaviour during the Champions League game against AC Milan." Return to results
Telewest to challenge Sky Plus Telewest to challenge Sky Plus Cable firm Telewest is to offer a personal video recorder (PVR) in a set -top box to challenge Sky Plus. Sky Plus is the market leader in the field of digital video recorders in the UK, with 474,000 subscribers. PVRs record TV programmes to a hard drive, letting viewers pause, and rewind live television and effectively "time shift" the viewing experience. A number of PVRs incorporating Freeview digital terrestrial TV are also on the market but their success is limited. Telewest's PVR will offer a 160GB hard drive, which has storage for up to 80 hours of programmes. The box has three tuners, which means viewers can record two channels simultaneously while watching a third channel. Sky Plus boxes come in two versions - a 20GB version for Â£99 and a 160GB version for Â£399. Sky also charges a Â£10 subscription fee to the service, unless viewers have a subscription to one of its premium packages. Telewest has yet to reveal pricing for the new box or if it will be charging a subscription fee for the service. Eric Tveter, president and chief operating officer at Telewest Broadband, said: "We will make our PVR set-top box available later this year, putting a stop to missed soaps, interrupted films and arguments over which programmes to record." PVRs and recordable DVD players are set to replace video recorders as the standard method of recording and saving favourite TV programmes. Last year, high street retailer Dixons said it was going to stop selling VHS machines in favour of PVRs and recordable DVD machines. Sky has said it aims to have 25% of its subscribers using Sky Plus by 2010 - it is predicting 10 million total subscribers by that date. It currently has 7.4 million subscribers, while Telewest provides digital cable to 1.7 million customers. Comments are closed for this article.
The Government is hastening slowly in confronting the issue of widespread alcohol abuse. Draft legis... The Government is hastening slowly in confronting the issue of widespread alcohol abuse. Draft legislation, published last Thursday, is unlikely to take effect for 12 months. By that time, Ministers may - or may not - have dealt with the issue of sports sponsorship by the drinks industry. Their political hesitancy may reflect a reluctance to challenge the electorate in its comfort zone. The unfortunate reality is that more than half of all Irish people engage in harmful alcohol consumption, while nearly one-third participate in weekly binge drinking. Tackling that level of abuse through higher prices and new controls is necessary. But it will not be popular with many of those affected and dissatisfaction could influence voting intentions. That reality may have encouraged the last government to cut excise duty on alcohol by 20 per cent in its 2010 budget. You could paper ministerial offices with the number of official reports that have identified the damage caused to individuals and families through excessive drinking, with consequential costs for the health services and the economy. The failure of political nerve in asking the public to confront its demons, while bowing to pressure from sports bodies, publicans and the drinks industry is regrettable. That, however, does not diminish the personal responsibility of many adults to review their drinking habits because of the bad example being given to young people. Legislation, of itself, will not eradicate our reputation as âthe drunken Irishâ. An educational programme to persuade young people that social enjoyment and celebration does not equate with being out of their heads on drink would help. A minimum pricing regime and rising costs is likely to alter existing patterns of behaviour in the short term. Across the European Union , there is a direct link between the affordability of alcohol and the amount people consume. Actions taken in Scandinavian countries have reduced consumption. Last yearâs National Substance Misuse Strategy set a target to reduce Irish alcohol use by one-fifth, bringing it into line with the EU average. If the public is serious about reducing the damage caused by alcohol, it must accept that prices will rise and access may become more restricted. This inconvenient truth will impinge on users, suppliers and sports organisations. The latter bodies have lobbied against a ban on sports sponsorship because of a loss in funding. Alcohol advertising shapes youthful perceptions and normalises its use as a means of marking success. Drinking from the cup and âgetting wastedâ in celebrations has become an intrinsic part of sporting culture. That will have to change. In the meantime, the Government should push ahead with a minimum pricing regime, tighter controls on advertising and an educational campaign. .

Time to get tough on friendlies? Time to get tough on friendlies? For an international manager, a friendly provides an important opportunity to work with your players. The only problem is that the game itself can often be a farce. Some people have been saying it would be better to get the players together for the week, and do away with the 90 minutes at the end. I would say it's 50-50 whether you should have these games or not, and if you look at it that way you would probably say you're better not doing so. It would certainly keep club managers happy, as it would reduce the risk of players returning to domestic duty injured. But international bosses will tell you that scrapping friendlies is counterproductive because the only way for a team to get better is by playing. The more you play together, the easier it is when it comes to the crunch in games like World Cup quarter-finals against Brazil. Often in friendlies, though, a manager will play his strongest side for the first 45 minutes and then send out an entirely different one in the second half. And it's very difficult for any player to come on as substitute in a side with a few changes, let alone a whole team's worth. The debate will rage on, and I'm not sure there is a satisfactory solution. One manager who has got it right this week is Walter Smith. The new Scotland manager has decided to have a training camp instead of a friendly for his first international week since replacing Berti Vogts. It is the sort of move you would expect from Walter, who is a canny manager. The players have had such a hard time recently that he is better off getting them together in a relaxed atmosphere and trying to generate some team spirit before the next World Cup qualifiers. If he had sent them out on Wednesday and they had been badly beaten, it would have done them no good whatsoever. John Toshack has his first game in charge of Wales, and it will be important for him to get a decent result against Hungary. He will have his own ideas on individuals and how to play and will probably look more at the performance, but the public wants results. It's extremely difficult to get the balance for friendlies. If you win, people forget them, but if you lose it becomes a stat that can be used against you. England's game against Holland is a good example. It looks like a good opportunity to try out players like Middlesbrough winger Stewart Downing or Crystal Palace striker Andy Johnson. But you have got to remember Sven-Goran Eriksson's side were given a lesson by Spain in the last game they played. The injury problems in defence should at least give the likes of Wes Brown and Jamie Carragher a chance to impress. For the club managers, it will simply be a case of waiting at home with fingers crossed. Return to results
Topaz to create 100 new jobs Topaz to create 100 new jobs Petroleum retail chain to open two new service stations in Carlow and Laois The Topaz garage in Kilmainham, Dublin. The fuels and convenience retailer is to create 100 new jobs at two new motorway service stations in Carlow and Laois. Photo: David Sleator/The Online News Fuel and convenience retailer Topaz is to create 100 new jobs in Carlow and Laois as part of an â¬8 million investment in new motorway service stations. The new service stations will be located at junction 3 on the Dublin-Cork motorway (M8) near Ballacolla, Co Laois and at junction 5 on the Dublin-Waterford motorway (M9) in Co Carlow. Work on the 600 square metre site in Co Laois will begin in January and is expected to be completed by July 2014. A planning application has been submitted for the Carlow site and construction there is expected to start next summer. Some 200 people will be employed during the construction phase of both sites, while 100 full time jobs would be created once the sites are operational, Topaz said. âWe have an excellent motorway network in Ireland now but there is a shortage of service areas and we want to address that. We see both these sites as being a vital rest and refueling stops for motorists travelling between Dublin and Cork and Dublin and Waterford,â Paul Candon of Topaz said. He said an estimated 10,000 motorists use both motorways every day. Comments are closed for this article.
UK inflation drops to 13-month low of 2.2 per cent UK inflation drops to 13-month low of 2.2 per cent Fall in petrol prices and other transport costs drives drop Consumer price inflation in the UK fell to an annual rate of 2.2 per cent in October far lower than the BoEâs forecast in August that inflation would exceed 2.8 per cent for the rest of the year. Photograph: Yui Mok/PA Wire Inflation in the UK unexpectedly dropped to its lowest rate for more than a year in October, reassuring the Bank of England that it has ample time to allow the economy to strengthen before it raises interest rates. Consumer price inflation fell to an annual rate of 2.2 per cent in October from 2.7 per cent in September, the Office for National Statistics said today. It was far lower than the BoEâs forecast in August that inflation would exceed 2.8 per cent for the rest of the year, although it comfortably exceeds wage growth, meaning pressure on Britonsâ living standards will continue. The fall echoed a similar decline in the euro zone last month, although in that case it was to just 0.7 per cent. The UK number was well below economistsâ average forecasts of a drop to 2.5 per cent and is the lowest rate since September 2012. It was driven by falls in petrol prices and other transport costs and technical effects related to a multi-year programme of university tuition fee rises. The BoE will publish new forecasts tomorrow, likely to underpin its pledge to keep rates low in the foreseeable future. âOctoberâs inflation data suggests that the UK economy is hitting a sweet spot of accelerating growth and falling inflation,â said Capital Economics analyst Martin Beck. âLooking forward, inflation may tick up a touch in November as some of the recent announcements of hefty increases in energy prices start to take effect. But ... underlying pressures are likely to remain subdued,â Mr Beck added. Sterling hit a two-month low against the dollar but British government bond prices turned positive on the day as the figures eased concerns that persistently high inflation might pressure the BoE to raise interest rates sooner than planned. In August the BoE committed to keep rates on hold until unemployment falls to 7 percent, unless inflation threatened to get out of control. Unemployment in the three months to September was 7.7 per cent. Online News .

US economists win Nobel prize US economists win Nobel prize Awarded prize for research that has improved the forecasting of asset prices Photos of the 2013 Nobel Prize laureates in Economic Sciences Eugene Fama (L-R), Lars Peter Hansen and Robert Shiller are displayed during a news conference at the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in Stockholm today. The three American scientists won the 2013 economics Nobel prize for research that has improved the forecasting of asset prices in the long term and helped the emergence of index funds in stock markets, the award-giving body said. Photograph: REUTERS/Claudio Bresciani/TT News Agency Three American scientists have won the 2013 economics Nobel prize for research that has improved the forecasting of asset prices in the long term and helped the emergence of index funds in stock markets, the award-giving body said. âThere is no way to predict the price of stocks and bonds over the next few days or weeks,â The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said in awarding the 8 million crown (â¬0.9 million) prize to Eugene Fama , Lars Peter Hansen and Robert Shiller . âBut it is quite possible to foresee the broad course of these prices over longer periods, such as the next three to five years. These findings ... were made and analyzed by this yearâs Laureates,â the academy said. Shiller helped create a closely watched gauge of US housing prices and in June this year warned of a potentially new housing bubble in some of Americaâs largest cities. Fama, tipped as a Nobel winner for many years, has been called the father of modern finance and is well-known for research showing that certain groups of stocks tend to outperform over time. The behaviour of asset prices are key to decisions such as savings, house buying and national economic policy, the academy said. âMispricing of assets may contribute to financial crises and, as the recent global recession illustrates, such crises can damage the overall economy,â it added. Fama and Hansen are professors at the University of Chicago, while Shiller is a professor at Yale University . âA lot of people had told me they hoped I would win it, but I am aware that there are so many other worthy people that I had discounted it, so I would say no, I did not expect it,â Schiller told a news conference. The economics prize, officially called the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel, was established in 1968. It was not part of the original group of awards set out in dynamite tycoon Nobelâs 1895 will. Latest Economy
US investment in Ireland totalled $129bn over five years US investment in Ireland totalled $129bn over five years Figure for FDI is about 14 times what the US firms invest in China Ireland was the fourth largest recipient of foreign direct investment from the US in 2012. US firms invested $129.5 billion in Ireland over the five years to 2012, about 14 times what the firms invest in China, a new report from the American Chamber said today. Ireland was the fourth largest recipient of foreign direct investment from the US in 2012, and rose 1 per cent to $22.8 billion, outperforming the general trends in Europe where US investment fell by 17.5 per cent. The figures showed that over the five year period from 2008 to 2012, the level of US investment in Ireland was more than the previous 58 years combined. This comes despite a global recession that has seen the worldâs major economies struggle, with unemployment rates rising. âIreland has become hugely important for the success of corporate America over the past five yearsâ, said Peter Keegan , president of the American Chamber of Commerce Ireland. âCorporate Americaâs FDI stock in Ireland is now equal to the combined stock in France and Germany and itâs nearly 20 per cent larger than the aggregate US stock in the four BRIC nations of Brazil, Russia, India and Chinaâ. The figures were contained in a report compiled for the American Chamber of Commerce. âIreland now ranks the number one export platform in the world for US affiliates,â report author Joesph Quinlan said. âThis underscores the importance of Ireland in the global value chains of US firms. Corporate Americaâs presence in Ireland is also tangible, visible, palpable, material, physical and concrete making Ireland a hugely important strategic cog in the global operations of many of the worldâs top corporations.â Minister forJjobs, Enterprise and Innovation Richard Bruton stressed the importance of US investment to the Irish economy. âDeepening and developing our economic ties with the United States will be crucial for our economic recovery and forms a major part of the Governmentâs plans for jobs and growth,â he said. âChallenges remain for Irish companies doing business in the US, but it is important to recognise that such companies employ well over 100,000 people there.â The report comes after prominent US firms Twitter , TripAdvisor and Qualtrics announced they would invest further to expand in Ireland. âOur ability to continue to provide a vibrant talent pool is crucially dependent not only on continuing investment in the education and training of our young people but also on our ability to retain the talent here in this country and to attract the talented people in from overseas when required,â Mr Keegan said. âIn many cases this will mean providing opportunities for Irish graduates to return home to work here. However, we have to accept that the current levels of personal taxation in this country make the task of retaining and attracting talent that bit more difficult.â He called on the Government to âthink hardâ about personal tax levels and their implications for Irelandâs future competitiveness as an FDI location. .

Ultra fast wi-fi nears completion Ultra fast wi-fi nears completion Ultra high speed wi-fi connections moved closer to reality on Thursday when Intel said it would list standards for the technology later this year. Intel is developing ultra-wideband technology (UWB) which would allow fast data transfer but with low power needs. UWB is tipped to be used for wireless transfer of video in the home or office and for use in wireless USB devices which need low power consumption. A rival UWB standard is being developed by Motorola and chip firm Freescale. At the mobile phone conference 3GSM in Cannes last month Samsung demonstrated a phone using UWB technology from Freescale. At a press conference on Thursday Intel announced that two UWB groups, WiMedia Alliance and Multi-band OFDM alliance had merged to support the technology. UWB makes it possible to stream huge amounts of data through the air over short distances. One of the more likely uses of UWB is to make it possible to send DVD quality video images wirelessly to TV screens or to let people beam music to media players around their home. The technology has the potential to transmit hundreds of megabits of data per second. "Consumer electronics companies want UWB to replace cables and simplify set-up," Jeff Ravencraft, technology strategist at Intel and chairman of the Wireless USB Promoter Group, told technology site ZDNet. "Thirty percent of consumer electronics returns are because the consumer couldn't set up the equipment." The first products using UWB technology from Intel are due to hit the market later this year. Initially they will be products using wireless USB 2.0 connections. UWB could also be used to create so-called Personal Area Networks that let a person's gadgets quickly and easily swap data amongst themselves. The technology works over a range up to 10 metres and uses billions of short radio pulses every second to carry data. Intel says the benefit of UWB is that it does not interfere with other wi-fi technologies already in use such as wi-fi, wimax and mobile phone networks.
Unclear future for striker Baros Unclear future for striker Baros Liverpool forward Milan Baros is uncertain whether he remains part of boss Rafa Benitez's plans after being dropped for the Carling Cup final. Baros, who is Liverpool's leading scorer this season, denied reports of a row with Benitez but claims he is mystified at being left on the bench. He told Czech newspaper Daily Sport: "I don't know why I didn't play on Sunday. I didn't argue with anybody. "I was disappointed but I am not thinking of leaving right now." The Czech international came on as a substitute after 74 minutes but could not prevent his side losing 3-2 to Chelsea after extra-time. Baros denied suggestions he wanted to leave the Millennium Stadium before the match upon learning of his omission from the starting line-up. But his admission that he "guessed something like this was going to happen on Saturday", will do little to quell claims of a falling-out with Benitez. And although Baros insisted thoughts of quitting Anfield are "not in my mind right now", he admitted "everything is possible". Return to results
Underdogs have more fun Underdogs have more fun I've always had a soft spot for the FA Cup, it's a fabulous competition - the best in the world - and there's nothing quite like it. We play Aston Villa in the third round on Saturday, and on paper it should be a straightforward win for them - but it's horrible being in the favourites' dressing room. It's a terrible feeling as a manager when you are expected to win. You're wondering whether your players will be up for it and doubts go through your mind. You try to instil in your players that they have to be professional and prepared for the battle ahead. They have to be ready for the crowd, a bad pitch sometimes, and what the underdogs will throw at them. But even if you do that, you still wonder if they will grasp it. The underdogs, on the other hand, have nothing to lose and can go out and enjoy it. Lower division players are not used to the publicity that surrounds the Cup and it's great for a manager because it's something different to talk about. You're not talking about struggles in the league, no-one is thinking about whether your form is good or bad, and the town is buzzing. As a boy, I remember being in short trousers and rushing down the road because people were coming up to the top of the hill and saying Norwich City were in town to face the Blades. Their fans were in big double-decker buses and waving down to us while we were sat there like the Railway Children. I also remember crying my eyes out when Burnley beat us. Every supporter really believes their club could get to the later stages. As a player, Scunthorpe did well at Newcastle once. Everyone said we were going to get slaughtered because they had Malcolm Macdonald. We took the lead and looked like we were going to hang on for a 1-0 win but Terry McDermott equalised in the last few minutes. There was an electricity strike and we had to play the replay in the afternoon - we lost 3-0. I still feel aggrieved at the manner of the defeat to Arsenal in the semi-finals a couple of seasons ago. The referee's decision went against us. It should be a cracking game against Villa. We're playing a super club, there should be a big crowd and it's live on Online News One, so we'll have national coverage. I'll just say to the lads "enjoy yourselves" because you play better when there is no pressure. I just hope the lads are ready and won't be overawed - we're not used to big crowds. As for potential winners, you can't look beyond the top three or four clubs, and I can't see too many upsets. There's always an opportunity but it's more likely to happen in the first game when there is an element of surprise. Since I've come to the twilight of my career, I always try to do as well as I can. Over the last couple of years we've got to the semis and quarters - at 200/1 we're a good price each way! Return to results
Warnings on woeful wi-fi security Warnings on woeful wi-fi security Companies are getting worse at keeping their wireless data networks secure. A survey of wi-fi networks in London, Frankfurt, New York and San Francisco by RSA Security found more than a third had basic security features turned off. By contrast last year's survey found that 15% of firms had failed to take basic steps to improve security. RSA warned that wi-fi's growing popularity made it much more likely that insecure networks would be found and exploited. Wireless or wi-fi networks have become hugely popular over the last few years in offices because they are easy to set up and make going online much more convenient. This popularity shows no sign of slowing reveals the annual RSA Security and NetSurity survey which found an annual 66% growth rate in the number of wireless nets being installed in London and Frankfurt. Although most firms do take steps to turn on the security functions built in to the wi-fi standard and protect themselves from attack, the survey found that a significant proportion were taking unnecessary risks. On average 33% of the wireless networks found by RSA and NetSurity researchers in London, Frankfurt, New York and San Francisco had not used basic security systems. Many firms were simply turning on their wireless net access points and use default settings that anyone familiar with wi-fi could easily find out. RSA said that 26% of wi-fi networks found London used default settings compared to 30% in Frankfurt, 31% in New York and 28% in San Francisco. Many users of wi-fi nets did not even turn on the encryption that scrambles data traffic between users and the access point helping them go online. This is despite a series of stories warning firms about the dangers of "drive-by hacking" in which computer criminals walk or drive around city centres using easy to use tools to spot wi-fi nets. "These figures are another stark warning to unsecured businesses to get their act together," said Phil Cracknell, chief technology officer at NetSurity. As more public wi-fi hotspots appear and people become more familiar with using them, it was getting more likely that insecure would be found, warned Mr Cracknell. "Accidental or intentional connection to a corporate network can bring with it a series of security issues including loss of confidential data and installation of malicious code," he said.

Wenger handed summer war chest Wenger handed summer war chest Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger has been guaranteed transfer funds to boost his squad the summer. The club's managing director, Keith Edelman, stressed that the development of their new Â£350m stadium had no affect on Wenger's spending power. "The money is there. Don't worry we've got it," Edelman told Online News Sport. "Hopefully, we'll spend it this summer and in the coming years. Arsene attends all our board meetings and he knows our finances are very strong." Edelman added that it was pointless having a brand new stadium if the team did not match the surroundings. "Its great to have nice, new surroundings, but if the team aren't performing on the pitch, then there isn't great respect in having a fabulous stadium," he said. "It's important that we had sufficient funds for our team in place, before we began on the stadium." Comments are closed for this article.
Wenger rules out new keeper Wenger rules out new keeper Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger says he has no plans to sign a new goalkeeper during the January transfer window. Wenger has brought in Manuel Almunia for the last three games for the out-of-form Jens Lehmann - but the Spaniard himself has been prone to mistakes. There have been suggestions that Wenger will swoop for a high-quality shot-stopper in the New Year. But he told the Evening Standard: "I don't feel it will be necessary to bring in a new goalkeeper in January." The Gunners manager refused to comment on the difficult start that 27-year-old Almunia has made to his career at Highbury. And he would not be drawn on whether Lehmann would return for the top-of-the table clash with Chelsea on Sunday. Almunia was at fault for Rosenborg's goal in Arsenal's 5-1 Champions League win on Tuesday and had some hairy moments in last week's win over Birmingham. But Wenger said earlier this week that his indifferent form was down to pressure caused by being under scrutiny from the media. "The debate has gone on too long. Everyone has an opinion and I do not have to add to it," Wenger added. Arsenal have been linked with Middlesbrough keeper Mark Schwarzer, Fulham's Edwin van der Sar and Parma's Sebastien Frey. And Wenger has no immediate plans to recall former England Under-21 international Stuart Taylor from his loan spell at Leicester. Comments are closed for this article.
What high-definition will do to DVDs What high-definition will do to DVDs First it was the humble home video, then it was the DVD, and now Hollywood is preparing for the next revolution in home entertainment - high-definition. High-definition gives incredible, 3D-like pictures and surround sound. The DVD disks and the gear to play them will not be out for another year or so, and there at are still a number of issues to be sorted out. But when high-definition films do come out on the new format DVDs, it will profoundly change home entertainment. For Rick Dean, director of business development for digital content company THX, a high-definition future is an exciting prospect. He has worked on the Star Wars DVD trilogy, Finding Nemo, The Incredibles and Indiana Jones. "There was a time not so long ago when the film world and the video world were two completely separate worlds," he told the Online News News website. "The technology we are dealing with now means they are very much conjoined. "The film that we see in theatres is coming from the same digital file that we take the home video master," he says. But currently, putting a master feature film onto DVD requires severe compression because current DVD technology cannot hold as much as high-definition films demand. "As much as you compress the picture data rate wise, you also take qualities away from the picture that we fight so hard to keep in the master," he explains. "I would love to be able to show people what projects that we worked on really look like in the high-def world and I find it very exciting." High-definition DVDs can hold up to six times more data than the DVDs we are used to. It will take time though to persuade people who spent money on DVD players to buy the different players and displays required to watch high-definition DVDs in 18 months' time. Mr Dean is confident though: "I think if they see real HD [high-definition], not some heavily compressed version of it, there is such a remarkable difference. "I have heard comments from people who say the images pop off the screen." High-definition will mean some changes for those working behind the scenes too. On the whole, producing films for high-definition DVDs will be easier in some ways because less compression is needed. Equally, it may mean Hollywood studios ask for more to be put onto the average DVD. "When we master movies right now, our data rates are running at about 1.2 gigabits per second," says Mr Dean. "Our DVDs that we put out today have to be squashed down to about five or six megabits per second. "That's a huge amount of compression that has to be applied - about 98%. So if you have anything that allows more space, you don't have to compress so hard." Studios could fit a lot more marketing material, games, and features, onto high-capacity DVDs. Currently, an entire DVD project can take up to three months, says Mr Dean. Although the step of down-converting will be bypassed, this will realistically only save a day's work, says Mr Dean. One of the most time consuming elements is building DVD navigation and menu systems. On the fairly complex Star Wars disks, making sure the menu buttons worked took 45 human hours alone. If studios want to cash in on the extra space, it could mean extra human hours, for which someone has to pay. "If the decision on the studio side is that they are going to put a lot more on these disks, it could be more expensive because of all the extra navigation that is required." And if studios do focus on delivering more "added value content", thinks Mr Dean, ultimately it could mean that they will want more money for it. Those costs could filter down to the price ticket on a high-definition DVD. But if the consumer is not willing to pay a premium price, studios will listen, thinks Mr Dean. High-definition throws up other challenge to film makers and DVD production alike. More clarity on screen means film makers have to make doubly sure that attention to detail is meticulous. "When we did the first HD version of Star Wars Episode I, everybody was very sun-tanned, but that was make-up. "In the HD version of Episode I, all these make-up lines showed up," explains Mr Dean. The restoration of the older Star Wars episodes revealed some interesting items too. "There are scans of a corridor [on the Death Star] and fairly plainly in one of those shots, there is a file cabinet stuck behind one of the doorways. "You never used to be able to see it because things are just blurred enough during the pan that you just didn't see it." What high-definition revolution ultimately means is that the line between home entertainment and cinema worlds will blur. With home theatre systems turning living rooms into cinemas, this line blurs even further. It could also mean that how we get films, and in what format, will widen. "In the future we are going to look towards file delivery over IP [internet protocol - broadband], giving a DVD-like experience from the set-top box to the hard drive," says Mr Dean. But that is some time off for most, and for now, people still like to show off something physical in their bookshelves. Comments are closed for this article.
A new blood test for pre-eclampsia, a severe pregnancy complication linked to high blood pressure, c... A new blood test for pre-eclampsia, a severe pregnancy complication linked to high blood pressure, could save hundreds of babiesâ lives a year, say researchers. The bedside test can give a result in 15 minutes and is able to identify 96 per cent of pregnant women at high risk of the condition. It was developed by British scientists who studied a group of 625 pregnant women from across the UK, 61 per cent of whom were affected by pre-eclampsia. The condition can damage the kidneys, liver and brain and lead to premature delivery, low birthweight babies and stillbirths. High blood pressure Dr Lucy Chappell , senior lecturer in obstetrics at Kingâs College London, said: âThe test is designed to differentiate women with pre-eclampsia from those with high blood pressure alone. Current tests for the condition only detect that itâs happening, rather than predicting it, and by that time the disease has progressed and has likely already caused organ damage.â Dr Chappell and Prof Shennan now plan to conduct a trial of the test in the UK and Ireland . â PA Return to results
Almost 2,500 children waiting over a year to see specialists Almost 2,500 children waiting over a year to see specialists Ban on recruitment in HSE blamed for delays in developmental and behavioural services âThousands of children have their lives effectively on hold because of our under-resourced and under-staffed services,â said June Tinsely of Barnados. Thousands of children with developmental delays and behavioural problems are waiting more than a year to see specialists, according to figures from the HSE. Almost 2,000 children who have problems with basic functions such as walking are waiting more than 52 weeks for help while more than 500 children are waiting over a year to be seen for conditions such as autism. Childrenâs and disability groups blame the waiting lists on a ban on recruitment in the HSE and are urging the Government not to make any more cuts to the health budget which would put more pressure on services. Occupational therapists The waiting lists are more severe in some parts of the country: children in the south of the country and the Dublin south/ Leinster region wait longer to see occupational therapists, who diagnose and treat children with developmental delays, Down syndrome or who have been in accidents. Out of a total of 1,961 children on waiting lists as of the end of August, more than 1,500 are in these two regions. Children in the south and west wait longer to see psychologists, who diagnose and treat intellectual disabilities such as autism. At the end of last August, out of a total of 504 children in the State waiting over a year to see mental-health specialists, 444 are living in the south and west. The HSE said it did not keep statistics for the number of children on waiting lists to see speech and language therapists. But waiting lists are thought to be significant, with staff at a Barnardos centre in Dublin saying local children with speech or language difficulties can wait up to two years to be seen. The HSE said it was recruiting 52.5 occupational therapists and 52 speech and language therapists who would be in place by the end of the year. âThese additional posts will make significant impacts on the waiting lists currently in existence,â it added in a statement. Long-term effects SiobhÃ¡n Kane, communications manager with Inclusion Ireland , said it was frustrating for parents to wait for such long periods and the effects on children could be long-term. âYou can try intervening when someone is 15 years old but there is never the same potential for helping them than when they are two years. And you canât go back.â Barnardos said low-income families suffered the most on waiting lists because they were less able to pay privately to see specialists. According to the Growing Up in Ireland survey published last month, children from low-income families were less healthy and more likely to have behavioural problems. âIf a three-year-old canât walk properly or run or jump, having to waiting a year or two for treatment is a significant proportion of their lives,â said Eilish Cullen, project worker at Barnardos in Mulhuddart, Dublin, which runs early intervention groups for young children. âIf it was happening to families which can afford it these children could be seen by a specialist straightaway but these families are left waiting years,â she added. âLives on holdâ June Tinsley, Barnardos policy officer, added: âThousands of children have their lives effectively on hold because of our under-resourced and under-staffed services. This is resulting in children starting school totally unable to cope or ill-equipped to adapt because of their undiagnosed and untreated condition. The school system canât cope as allocated resource teachers/SNAs are already over stretched.â Return to results
Almunia says European Commission is awaiting presentation of âclear ideasâ for restructuring Almunia says European Commission is awaiting presentation of âclear ideasâ for restructuring European competition commissioner Joaquin Almunia in Dublin yesterday. âWe are not yet at the end of the discussions with Permanent TSB,â he said. Photograph: Cyril Byrne European Commission approval of Permanent TSBâs restructuring plan is still some months away, despite the banksâs hopes that it could be achieved by the end of this month. European competition commissioner JoaquÃ­n Almunia said in Dublin yesterday that the plan should be accepted âhopefully, in a few monthsâ. âWe are waiting for the presentation of clear ideas for the restructuring of this institution,â he said. âWe are not yet at the end of the discussions with Permanent TSB . â Mr Almunia, who was addressing the Institute of International and European Affairs and the Association of European Journalists, indicated that AIBâs restructuring proposals would be considered in a similar timeframe. In a statement issued to The Online News, Permanent TSB confirmed discussions on its plan were continuing. âConfidentâ âThere is now a constructive engagement under way with the EU Commission which we are confident will lead to an agreement relatively quickly,â a spokesman for the bank said. Mr Almunia said his department will âfactor inâ last monthâs reversal of troubled Newbridge Credit Union into Permanent TSB, while also taking close account of the Central Bankâs recent balance sheet assessments of the sector. The commissioner declined to be specific about possible plans to separate out Permanent TSBâs loss-making tranche of tracker mortgages, aside from acknowledging that âthese are things under discussionâ. âWe donât impose any kind of system,â he said.

Anelka 'eyes Man City departure' Anelka 'eyes Man City departure' Striker Nicolas Anelka reportedly wants to leave Manchester City in search of Champions League football. Anelka, 25, is in talks over a contract extension beyond 2007 with City but is believed to fear his career will go stale if he stays at the club. The News of the World reports that Anelka told a French magazine: "I either decide to win titles or to have an easy life. "I think I will always choose football, if a great club makes me an offer." He added: "To win titles you need players who have the capability of doing so. If we stagnate between eighth and 15th place it's impossible to progress. "If I am going to score goals and not win, there is a risk it is going to create a feeling of being fed up." Anelka has earned a reputation for being a difficult character to handle after spells at Arsenal, Real Madrid and Paris St Germain and he feels that is now coming back to haunt him. "I am in talks to sign an extension to my contract," he said. "I am well here but the sporting aspect also comes into account. "Playing for eighth place is good but I miss the Champions League. "I won it with Real Madrid in 2000 and I need to be playing in it - and I should be playing in it. "I'm not in it because of things that have happened in the past and had nothing to do with football. "But I don't blame anyone. It's a bit my fault." Comments are closed for this article.
Argentine great Caniggia retires Argentine great Caniggia retires Former Argentina international Claudio Caniggia has retired from playing football at the age of 38. The striker enjoyed a glittering career, playing with Boca Juniors, River Plate, Roma, Benfica, Dundee and Rangers among others. He was also suspended for 13 months after testing positive for cocaine while with Roma in 1993. "I work out every day, but after seven months without activity, I don't want to play football anymore," he said. "I had offers, but none of those convinced me. Being 38 and after thinking a lot about it, I made this decision," he told Argentine radio station Del Plata. His next decision is where to live. "Now I'm in Scotland, but I'm moving all around Europe," he added. "I live in Glasgow because my children go to school there, but I have to be honest, it's too cold!" Caniggia played in the Argentina team that finished runners-up at the 1990 World Cup in Italy, and was also a member of the side at USA 94 and Japan and Korea 2002. He became something of a hero after moving to Dundee in 2000 and won a move to Rangers, where he won two Scottish Cups, two League Cups and the SPL title. He then joined Al Arabi in Qatar but has since returned to Scotland. Comments are closed for this article.
Beattie return calms attack fears Beattie return calms attack fears Everton striker James Beattie has been declared fit for training on Tuesday, despite suffering an alleged assault last Saturday. Beattie, 27, is not believed to be as seriously hurt as some reports have suggested after being "the victim of an unprovoked assault" in Birmingham. He was on a night out with his girlfriend and two friends following Everton's 3-1 win over Aston Villa. "He was shaken but not badly injured," said Everton spokesman Ian Ross. He added: "He did speak to the police but will not be pressing charges. "He has spoken to manager David Moyes about what happened." Beattie was suspended for the win at Aston Villa after his red card against Chelsea and he will be available again for the Merseyside derby at Liverpool on 20 March. Return to results
Beckham relief as Real go through Beckham relief as Real go through David Beckham expressed his relief at Real Madrid's passage to the Champions League knockout phase. After Real's 3-0 win at Roma, the England skipper admitted another season of under-achievement would not be tolerated at the Bernabeu stadium. Beckham said: "It's expected of Madrid to get through, but it's a relief for the club and players to have won. "We lost momentum last season but we cannot afford to to go another season without winning anything." Real's finish as runners-up in their Champions League group means they cannot face his old club Manchester United in the next round. But Real could be drawn against other Premiership hopefuls, Arsenal or Chelsea, who won their respective groups. "It's going to be great whoever we play, even if we don't get either of the two English teams." Return to results
Bellamy under new fire Bellamy under new fire Newcastle boss Graeme Souness has reopened his dispute with Craig Bellamy after claiming the Welshman was "not good enough" for the Magpies. Bellamy left Newcastle to join Celtic on loan after a major row with Souness. Souness - who refused to refer to the 25-year-old by name - said Bellamy did not score enough goals "The chap that's just gone has scored 9.3 goals a season in his time in senior football - half of those weren't even in the top flight," said Souness. "That's not good enough for a striker at a club like this. "We need to have two strikers who are near 20 goals on a regular basis." Bellamy turned down a move to Birmingham in favour of joining Celtic after a disagreement about the Welsh international playing out of position quickly escalated. Earlier in the week, Souness had said that he risked losing the confidence of the players and damaging his own reputation if he had not taken a hard line after Bellamy accused him of lying. "There are certain things you can forgive and forget," said Souness. "But if I'd been seen to be weak in this case there was no future for me with the players in the dressing room or any job I have after Newcastle." He could then return to St James' Park - and he says that he wants to. However, it would seem unlikely he will play for Newcastle again as long as Souness remains in charge.

Bill gives effect to measures announced in budget, including increased savings tax and new jobs incentives Minister for Finance Michael Noonan at Government Buildings before delivering the Budget to the House. Photograph: Bryan OâBrien /The Online News. The Government has published the Finance Bill, which gives effect to measures announced in the Budget last week that include tax relief for home renovations, the reduction of the air travel tax and an additional levy on pension funds for 2014. As part of the Budget 2014 measures, the Government announced 25 pro-business and pro-jobs initiatives, which are set to cost more than â¬500 million. This will be funded by almost â¬700 million of new tax measures. Those new measures included increased taxation on savings interest, reduced medical insurance relief and the abolition of top slicing relief for all ex-gratia payments made on or after January 1st, 2014. Under the Bill, the 9 per cent VAT rate will be retained for the tourist industry, a measure that the industry had lobbied hard for in the run up to the Budget. Mr Noonan said the commencement date for the home renovation incentive was being brought forward to include works that commence from October 25th, providing relief at a rate of 13.5 per cent relief on qualifying expenditure of a minimum of â¬5,000 before VAT and a maximum of â¬30,000. Those availing of the scheme will see the credit awarded in 2015 and 2016. The increased rate of DIRT, which will stand at 41 per cent, is provided for in the Bill. The Bill also puts in place the structure for the Start Your Own Business incentive scheme and extends the relief for the film industry. The Bill provides for a number of measures not announced on Budget Day, including enhanced double taxation relief in respect of leasing income that is set to benefit the aircraft leasing industry, and the removal of the 50 per cent restriction on the amount of prior year trading losses a Nama participating institution - AIB and Bank of Ireland - can set off against trading profits. That measure will help reduce the risk of future capital injections by the State that may arise from upcoming stress tests. Return to results
Blackburn v Burnley Blackburn v Burnley Ewood Park Tuesday, 1 March 2000 GMT Howard Webb (South Yorkshire) home to Leicester in the quarter-finals But defender Andy Todd is suspended and could be replaced by Dominic Matteo - if he recovers from a hamstring injury. Burnley have major injury concerns over Frank Sinclair and John McGreal. Michael Duff looks set to continue at right-back with John Oster in midfield and Micah Hyde is expected to recover from a knee injury. - Blackburn boss Mark Hughes: "Burnley are resolute and have individual talent but I fully expect us to progress. "I thought we were comfortable in the first game and never thought we were under pressure. "It's a competition we want to progress in and we are doing okay. If we beat Burnley, we have a home tie against another lower league club (Leicester)." - Burnley boss Steve Cotterill: "They will be fresh and we'll be tired. That is an honest opinion but our lads just might be able to get themselves up for one more big game. "The atmosphere at the last game was very hot - a good verbal contest. "Our fans will not need whipping up for this game. I just want them to help us as much as they can in a positive way." KEY MATCH STATS - BLACKBURN ROVERS against Bolton is part two of an East Lancashire hotpot that didn't turn out to be that spicy when first staged on a Sunday lunchtime the weekend before last, and resulted in a scrappy goalless draw. - Rovers, who are aiming to win the Cup for a seventh time in their history and first time in 77 years, face another replay against Championship opposition after eventually disposing of Cardiff at Ewood Park in the third round. But they've not been beaten in the competition by a club outside the Premiership for nine years, since Ipswich - then in the second tier - defeated them 0-1 after extra time in a third round replay at Ewood Park on 16 January 1996. History is on Rovers side. When they last met their near neighbours in the FA Cup 45 years ago, it also required an Ewood Park replay, which the home side won 2-0, and when they last met in the League, Rovers did the double. They first won their Nationwide Division One trip to Turf Moor 0-2 four seasons ago, and then thrashed the Clarets on home soil 5-0. - Manager Mark Hughes, who won the Cup four times as a player, is aiming to steer Rovers into the quarter-finals for the second time in 12 years, and first time since the 2000/2001 season. Success here, and victory home to Leicester in the next round, could see Rovers in the semi-finals without having played Premiership opposition. - BURNLEY make the eight mile journey to their fierce rivals, determined to send Blackburn the same way as Liverpool in the third round. But having failed to pull off another shock at Turf Moor, it could be that the Championship outfit - 17 places inferior on the League ladder - have missed their best opportunity. Having said that, Burnley are yet to concede a goal in this Cup run. - Steve Cotterills' Clarets have been knocked out in the fifth round four times in the last seven years, and have made only one appearance in the sixth round in 21 years. That was in the season before last, when they disposed of Premiership Fulham at this fifth round stage. - While Blackburn have not played since the fifth round tie, Burnley have had two League outings away from home, drawing 1-1 at Derby and losing 1-0 at Preston. That takes their winless run to four games. The combatants from one-time prosperous mill towns, are both founder members of the Football League.

Blues slam Blackburn over Savage Blues slam Blackburn over Savage Birmingham have confirmed Blackburn made a bid for Robbie Savage - but managing director Karen Brady has called it "derisory". Rovers have reportedly offered Â£500,000 up front for the Wales star, 30, with the fee rising to Â£2.2m. But Brady told The Sun the bid was "a waste of fax paper and my time". She added: "The way things are going all this could affect the relationship between the clubs. They've got into Robbie's head. But he's not for sale." Savage's future at Birmingham has been the source of speculation for several weeks, with some fans criticising his performances for the club earlier in the season. However, good displays against West Brom and Aston Villa have impressed Blues fans. "The crowd gave me a massive standing ovation when I came off on Saturday which was nice," he said. "It was fantastic even though I was criticised by a number of them in recent weeks and on Saturday it showed how much I mean to them. "It's not for me to say (about transfer rumours), it's between the two clubs. "I haven't created the speculation myself, I haven't phoned every national newspaper saying, 'Blackburn are trying to buy me'. It's not up to me." Birmingham manager Steve Bruce insists he does not want to sell Savage. "A lot is said and written about Sav but he has been terrific for Birmingham City the last two and a half years," he said. "The fans love him because he epitomises them. He works hard, They like people like that and there are not many like him. "And why the hell should I sell him to someone else? I am not interested."

Bond game fails to shake or stir Bond game fails to shake or stir For gaming fans, the word GoldenEye evokes excited memories not only of the James Bond revival flick of 1995, but also the classic shoot-em-up that accompanied it and left N64 owners glued to their consoles for many an hour. Adopting that hallowed title somewhat backfires on this new game, for it fails to deliver on the promise of its name and struggles to generate the original's massive sense of fun. This however is not a sequel, nor does it relate to the GoldenEye film. You are the eponymous renegade spy, an agent who deserts to the Bond world's extensive ranks of criminal masterminds, after being deemed too brutal for MI6. Your new commander-in-chief is the portly Auric Goldfinger, last seen in 1964, but happily running around bent on world domination. With a determination to justify its name which is even less convincing than that of Tina Turner's similarly-titled theme song, the game literally gives the player a golden eye following an injury, which enables a degree of X-ray vision. Rogue Agent signals its intentions by featuring James Bond initially and proceeding to kill him off within moments, squashed by a plummeting helicopter. The notion is of course to add a novel dark edge to a 007 game, but the premise simply does not get the juices flowing like it needs to. Recent Bond games like Nightfire and Everything Or Nothing were very competent and did a fine job of capturing the sense of flair, invention and glamour of the film franchise. This title lacks that aura, and when the Bond magic shines through, it feels like a lucky accident. The central problem is that the gameplay just is not good enough. Quite aside from the bizarre inability to jump, the even more bizarre glaring graphical bugs and dubious enemy AI, the levels simply are not put together with much style or imagination. Admittedly the competition has been tough, even in recent weeks, with the likes of Halo 2 and Half Life 2 triumphing in virtually every department. What the game is good at is enveloping you in noisy, dynamic scenes of violent chaos. As is the trend of late, you are made to feel like you are in the midst of a really messy and fraught encounter. Sadly that sense of action is outweighed by the difficulty of navigating and battling within the chaos, meaning that frustration is often the outcome. And irregular save points mean you have to backtrack each time you are killed. A minute red dot passes for a crosshair, although the collision-detection is so suspect that the difficulties of aiming weapons are compensated for. Shooting enemies from a distance can be tricky, and you will not always know you have picked them off, since dead enemies vanish literally before they have fully hit the floor, and they do so in some woefully uninspiring death animations. It is perhaps indicative of a lack of confidence that the game maker's allow you several different weapons almost immediately and throw you quickly into raging firefights - no time is risked with a measured build-up. By far the most satisfying element of the game is seeing old favourites like Dr No, Goldfinger, hat-fiend Oddjob and crazed Russian sex beast Xenia Onatopp resurrected after all these years, and with their faces rendered in an impressively recognisable fashion. There is a real thrill from doing battle with these legendary villains, and it is a testament to the power of the Bond universe that they can cut such a dash. But the in-game niggles, combined with a story and presentation that just do not feel sufficiently well thought-through, will make this a disappointment for most. Diehard fans of Bond will probably find enough here to make it a worthwhile purchase and try to ignore the failings. The game is weak, not completely unplayable. Then again, 007 fanatics may also take umbrage at the cavalier blending of characters from different eras. Given James Bond's healthy pedigree in past games, there is every reason to hope that this is just a blip, a commendable idea that just has not worked, that will be rectified when the character inevitably makes his return.

Britons growing 'digitally obese' Britons growing 'digitally obese' Gadget lovers are so hungry for digital data many are carrying the equivalent of 10 trucks full of paper in "weight". Music, images, e-mails, and texts are being hoarded on mobiles, cameras laptops and PDAs (Personal Digital Assistants), a Toshiba study found. It found that more than 60% kept 1,000 to 2,000 music files on their devices, making the UK "digitally fat". "Virtual weight" measurements are based on research by California Institute of Technology professor Roy Williams. He calculated physical comparisons for digital data in the mid-1990s. He worked out that one gigabyte (1,000,000,000 bytes) was the equivalent of a pick-up truck filled with paper. The amount of data people are squirreling away on their gadgets is clearly a sign that people are finding more things to do with their shiny things. If digital hoarding habits continue on this scale, people could be carrying around a "digitally obese" 20 gigabytes by next year. "Britain has become a nation of information hoarders with a ferocious appetite for data," said Martin Larsson, general manager of Toshiba's European storage device division. "As storage capabilities increase and the features and functionalities of mobile devices expand to support movie files and entire libraries of multi-media content, we will all become virtually obese," he told the Online News News website. The survey reflects the increasing trend for portable devices with built-in hard drives like music and media players from Apple, Creative Labs, Archos, iRiver and others. This trend is set to grow, according to analysts. They suggest the number of hard drives in consumer electronics gadgets could grow from 17 million last year to 55 million in 2006. "Consumers are driving the move towards smaller devices that have greater functionality, and industry is trying to keep up," said Mr Larsson. "People are looking for more than just phone calls and text messages on the move, they want things like web browsing, e-mailing, music, photos and more." Many are finding memory keys and memory sticks are simply not big enough to hold everything. "Floppies and memory keys have their place, but they don't have anything like the capacity or flexibility of a hard drive so are unable to meet the demand for more and more storage capacity in consumer devices," said Mr Larsson. The cost of making hard drives has dropped and is continuing to do so because of improved technologies so they are proving to be more cost-effective than other forms of memory, he added. The amount of data that can be stored has grown by 400% in the last three years, while the cost for every gigabyte has fallen by 80%. It is also getting easier to transfer files from one device to another, which has traditionally been a slow and problematic area. "Transfer of data between different memory types has improved significantly in recent times, and will be further helped by the standards for hard drives which are currently being developed by the major manufacturers," said Mr Larsson. According to technology analysts IDC, a fifth of all hard drives produced will be used in consumer electronics by 2007. Return to results
Broadband in the UK gathers pace Broadband in the UK gathers pace One person in the UK is joining the internet's fast lane every 10 seconds, according to BT. The telecoms giant said the number of people on broadband via the telephone line had now surpassed four million. Including those connected via cable, almost six million people have a fast, always-on connection. The boom has been fuelled by fierce competition and falling prices, as well as the greater availability of broadband over the phone line. "The take-up rate for broadband is accelerating at a terrific pace," said Ben Verwaayen, BT's chief executive. "We will be in a very strong position to hit our five million target by summer 2006 much earlier than we had previously expected." The last million connections were made over the past four months, with thousands of people being added to the total every day of the week. Those signing up to broadband include those that get their service direct from BT or via the many companies that re-sell BT lines under their own name. Part of the surge in people signing up was due to BT stretching the reach of ADSL - the UK's most widely used way of getting broadband - beyond six kilometres. Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line technology lets ordinary copper phone lines support high data speeds. The standard speed is 512kbps, though faster connections are available. According to BT, more than 95% of UK homes and businesses can receive broadband over the phone line. It aims to extend this figure to 99.4% by next summer. There are also an estimated 1.7 million cable broadband customers in the UK. Return to results
Broadband takes on TV viewing Broadband takes on TV viewing The number of Europeans with broadband has exploded over the past 12 months, with the web eating into TV viewing habits, research suggests. Just over 54 million people are hooked up to the net via broadband, up from 34 million a year ago, according to market analysts Nielsen/NetRatings. The total number of people online in Europe has broken the 100 million mark. The popularity of the net has meant that many are turning away from TV, say analysts Jupiter Research. It found that a quarter of web users said they spent less time watching TV in favour of the net The report by Nielsen/NetRatings found that the number of people with fast internet access had risen by 60% over the past year. The biggest jump was in Italy, where it rose by 120%. Britain was close behind, with broadband users almost doubling in a year. The growth has been fuelled by lower prices and a wider choice of always-on, fast-net subscription plans. "Twelve months ago high speed internet users made up just over one third of the audience in Europe; now they are more than 50% and we expect this number to keep growing," said Gabrielle Prior, Nielsen/NetRatings analyst. "As the number of high-speed surfers grows, websites will need to adapt, update and enhance their content to retain their visitors and encourage new ones." The total number of Europeans online rose by 12% to 100 million over the past year, the report showed, with the biggest rise in France, Italy, Britain and Germany. The ability to browse web pages at high speed, download files such as music or films and play online games is changing what people do in their spare time. A study by analysts Jupiter Research suggested that broadband was challenging television viewing habits. In homes with broadband, 40% said they were spending less time watching TV. The threat to TV was greatest in countries where broadband was on the up, in particular the UK, France and Spain, said the report. It said TV companies faced a major long-term threat over the next five years, with broadband predicted to grow from 19% to 37% of households by 2009. "Year-on-year we are continuing to see a seismic shift in where, when and how Europe's population consume media for information and entertainment and this has big implications for TV, newspaper and radio," said Jupiter Research analyst Olivier Beauvillian.

California sets fines for spyware California sets fines for spyware The makers of computer programs that secretly spy on what people do with their home PCs could face hefty fines in California. From 1 January, a new law is being introduced to protect computer users from software known as spyware. The legislation, which was approved by Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, is designed to safeguard people from hackers and help protect their personal information. Spyware is considered by computer experts to be one of the biggest nuisance and security threats facing PC users in the coming year. The software buries itself in computers and can collect a wide range of information. At its worst, it has the ability to hijack personal data, like passwords, login details and credit card numbers. The programs are so sophisticated they change frequently and become impossible to eradicate. One form of spyware called adware has the ability to collect information on a computer user's web-surfing. It can result in people being bombarded with pop-up ads that are hard to close. In Washington, Congress has been debating four anti-spyware bills, but California is a step ahead. The state's Consumer Protection Against Spyware Act bans the installation of software that takes control of another computer. It also requires companies and websites to disclose whether their systems will install spyware. Consumers are able to seek up to $1,000 in damages if they think they have fallen victim to the intrusive software. The new law marks a continuing trend in California towards tougher privacy rights. A recent survey by Earthlink and Webroot found that 90% of PCs are infested with the surreptitious software and that, on average, each one is harbouring 28 separate spyware programs. Currently users wanting protection from spyware have turned to free programs such as Spybot and Ad-Aware. Comments are closed for this article.
Celtic make late bid for Bellamy Celtic make late bid for Bellamy Newcastle striker Craig Bellamy is discussing a possible short-term loan move to Celtic, Online News Sport understands. The Welsh striker has rejected a move to Birmingham after falling out with Magpies manager Graeme Souness. The Toon boss vowed Bellamy would not play again after a bitter row over his exclusion for the game against Arsenal. Celtic are in no position to match Birmingham's Â£6m offer but a stay until the end of the season could suit Bellamy while he considers his future. According to Bellamy's agent, the player dismissed a permanent move to Birmingham. And it is unlikely that Newcastle would allow the player to go on loan to another Premiership club. Bellamy was fined two weeks' wages after a live TV interview in which he accused Souness of lying, following a very public dispute about what position Bellamy should play in the side. Souness said: "He can't play for me ever again. He has been a disruptive influence from the minute I walked into this football club. "He can't go on television and accuse me of telling lies." Chairman Freddy Shepherd described Bellamy's behaviour as "totally unacceptable and totally unprofessional". Comments are closed for this article.
Central Bank study says new plans needed to boost SME funding Central Bank study says new plans needed to boost SME funding Survey suggests there is room for more policies to aid credit flow Despite a rapid increase in measures aimed at promoting lending to SMEs over recent years, Ireland is still in the middle-range when compared with countries across the OECD, according to a new study by the Central Bank. In a paper published today it says this suggests that there is room to implement new policies aimed at boosting credit to SMEs, âif such a strategy is deemed desirableâ. Potential areas for Government-led initiatives include support for export financing and alternative financing sources such as peer-to-peer lending and retail âmini- bondâ markets, it says. Peer-to-peer lending, which matches retail investors with borrowers on internet-based platforms, has grown in prominence in the US in the past decade, but is not without its risks. Mini-bonds are another method whereby retail investments can be channelled towards SMEs, though the paper notes that this sort of financing is probably more suited to medium-sized companies than to small or micro companies. Other policy measures not yet available are outside the control of the Irish authorities and included targeted bank funding schemes and support for SME loan securitisation. The paper says that given the scale of the difficulties faced by the Irish finance sector since 2008, policies aimed at stimulating the flow of bank credit to SMEs are of the utmost importance. Because of the extent to which Irish SMEs are reliant on bank financing, and the sectorâs importance to economic and employment growth, an inventive and active set of policies aimed at diversifying the range of funding options available for the sector, appear to be particularly desirable, according to the paper. Policy Measures to Improve Access to Credit for SMEs; a Survey, was written by Sarah Holton , Fergal McCann, Kathryn Prendergast and David Purdue . Comments are closed for this article.
Central Remedial Clinic used charity money to top up senior staff salaries Central Remedial Clinic used charity money to top up senior staff salaries Company linked to disability group had â¬14 million in funds during cuts to services Carl O'Brien, Martin Wall The Central Remedial Clinic has admitted using charitable funds to top up the salaries of senior staff members. In a statement today, the Dublin-based clinic confirmed that money was collected by a company linked to the organisation and used to pay top-up allowances to senior staff. An internal HSE audit completed last year found that almost â¬250,000 in allowances was being paid annually to six senior staff members, in addition to their State-funded salaries. For example, its then chief executive was on a publicly funded salary of â¬106,900. This was supplemented with funds from the clinic totalling â¬136,000. This resulted in a total pay package of more than â¬240,000 These unauthorised allowances are a breach of public sector pay policy. The Friends and Supporters of the Remedial Clinic , a separate company linked to the clinic, generates funds from a lottery administered by the Care Trust. Latest figures show this company had a total of â¬14 million in funds at the end of 2011, at a time when the clinic has been accused of cutting services to vulnerable children and adults. The lottery generates about â¬2million a year, records indicate. It did not receive any National Lottery funding. In a statement, the clinic - which is a national centre for the care of children and adults with physical disabilities - said the Friends and Supporters organisation enabled the clinic to fund a large number of capital projects. It said these have included the development of CRC Waterford - which it described as a large state of the art centre which provides services to children with physical disabilities in the South East region, - at a cost of â¬2 million Funds were also used for renovation projects at CRC Clontarf, at a cost in excess of â¬7 million, since 2004, it said. It added that the money also helped the development of CRC Limerick , a clinic which provides a range of specialised services for the mid-west region. The clinic also responded to details regarding salaries at the organisation and said that since 2009, the clinic has had an agreed position with the HSE to phase out the level of management salaries for nine individuals who were being paid over and above public pay scales. âIt was agreed at the time that as these positions became available through retirement or vacancy, new staff would be engaged on compliant salaries,â it said. At present, five of these posts remain following retirement and vacancy and two of these posts are due to retire in the next two years, it said. In line with this agreement, it said the salary of the Central Remedial Clinicâs current chief executive, Brian Conlan , is fully compliant. Comments are closed for this article.
Cheaper chip for mobiles Cheaper chip for mobiles A mobile phone chip which combines a modem and a computer processor on one bit of silicon instead of two could make phones cheaper and more powerful. The specially-designed chip, developed by Texas Instruments, could drive down the cost of making mobiles capable of 3D gaming and 30-frame-a-second video. Currently, rich multimedia features tend to be on more expensive handsets. The technology, OMAP-Vox, is being tested by firms in Europe and Asia and could appear by the end of the year. Texas, which makes computer chips for more than half the world's mobile phones, said it was keen to make multimedia functions like video and gaming more affordable. "We're going to drive them down into meat-and-potatoes phones that have the largest market share," said Doug Rasor, a marketing vice president at Texas. The chip also uses much less power than conventional chips, said Texas, which means less strain on mobile battery life. More than 50 million people own a mobile in the UK, but mobile operators are keen to encourage people to move onto more sophisticated handsets that can do more. Texas is keen to cash in on the third generation (3G) of mobile technology, which offers high-speed networks for video streaming and other multimedia functions. But it faces stiff competition from the likes of Intel which is also looking to provide better chips for high-end mobiles. Competition to get people using 3G mobiles will grow in the next year as almost all of the UK's operators have now launched third generation networks. A recent survey by Sony Ericsson predicted that the number of 3G handsets sold in 2005 would double from 2004 to account for 10% of all phones sold. Many consumers are still to be convinced though. A further recent survey said that only 4% of mobile owners were thinking of upgrading to 3G phones. Many said they were confused about the different ways to pay for phones and the vast array of features most have onboard. But there will be continued demand for better chips as the industry continues to develop new standards and future networks. Earlier in January, NTT DoCoMo and Vodafone joined forces to develop the next generation of high-speed networks, known as "super 3G", intended to be 10 times faster than 3G services. The first stage of development is to be completed by 2007, but no date has been set for a commercial launch The newly-designed OMAP-Vox chip set was announced ahead of the start of a major mobile industry conference, 3GSM, which takes place in Cannes, France this week.

Chelsea sack Mutu Chelsea sack Mutu Chelsea have sacked Adrian Mutu after he failed a drugs test. The 25-year-old tested positive for a banned substance - which he later denied was cocaine - in October. Chelsea have decided to write off a possible transfer fee for Mutu, a 15.8m signing from Parma last season, who may face a two-year suspension. A statement from Chelsea explaining the decision read:"We want to make clear that Chelsea has a zero tolerance policy towards drugs." Mutu scored six goals in his first five games after arriving at Stamford Bridge but his form went into decline and he was frozen out by coach Jose Mourinho. Chelsea's statement added: "This applies to both performance-enhancing drugs or so-called 'recreational' drugs. They have no place at our club or in sport. "In coming to a decision on this case, Chelsea believed the club's social responsibility to its fans, players, employees and other stakeholders in football regarding drugs was more important than the major financial considerations to the company. "Any player who takes drugs breaches his contract with the club as well as Football Association rules. "The club totally supports the FA in strong action on all drugs cases." Fifa's disciplinary code stipulates that a first doping offence should be followed by a six-month ban. And the sport's world governing body has re-iterated their stance over Mutu's failed drugs test, maintaining it is a matter for the domestic sporting authorities. "Fifa is not in a position to make any comment on the matter until the English FA have informed us of their disciplinary decision and the relevant information associated with it," said a Fifa spokesman. Chelsea's move won backing from drug-testing expert Michelle Verroken. Verroken, a former director of drug-free sport for UK Sport, insists the Blues were right to sack Mutu and have enhanced their reputation by doing so. "Chelsea are saying quite clearly to the rest of their players and their fans that this is a situation they are not prepared to tolerate. "It was a very difficult decision for them and an expensive decision for them but the terms of his contract were breached and it was the only decision they could make. "It is a very clear stance by Chelsea and it has given a strong boost to the reputation of the club." It emerged that Mutu had failed a drugs test on October 18 and, although it was initially reported that the banned substance in question was cocaine. The Romanian international later suggested it was a substance designed to enhance sexual performance. The Football Association has yet to act on Mutu's failed drugs test and refuses to discuss his case. Return to results
Children need to be persuaded to play âThe Great Outdoorâ Children need to be persuaded to play âThe Great Outdoorâ Pulling the plug may be the way to get children outdoors and away from screens How do you prise the controls from their sweaty little hands and get them outside? Photograph: Eric Luke So another study has proven what many parents already know. Children who spend a lot of time in front of television, video games and small screens are more likely to become overweight. The latest report from the Growing Up in Ireland research shows that five-year-old children who spend three or more hours in front of a screen are considerably more likely to consume unhealthy foods more often and become obese. And donât reassure yourself that this fat will melt away when they turn into teenagers. According to Prof James Williams , principal investigator of the Growing Up in Ireland series, if a young child is manifesting these trends at an early age, he or she has a much higher probability of sustaining that into adulthood. But this is the era of the Xbox, iPod, iPad, PSP, Wii U, DS and any other initials you care to add. We live in a time when a toddler is as likely to swipe your iPhone screen as open a book. Remember the days when the television was the sole battleground? Now thereâs YouTube to police where an innocent search for a song can lead children down unsavoury avenues. And thatâs before they look at the comments underneath the videos. There are the endless requests for Grand Theft Auto and other over-18s games because apparently every other 12-year-old has them. Thereâs the constant pinging from Whatâs App? as pre-teens âhiâ and âlolâ over and back to each other all evening. Suddenly you find yourself longing for the innocent antics of Spongebob Squarepants. So how do you prise the controls from their sweaty little hands and get them outside? In the UK last month almost 400 organisations, from playgroups to the NHS, came together as the Project Wild Network to encourage families to reconnect with nature. They want children to take up activities like conkers and camping, and say an extra 30 minutes of wild time every day for under 12s would be the equivalent of just three months of their childhood spent outdoors. Some parenting experts advise rationing screen consumption to a certain number of hours per week and say children should be encouraged to take responsibility for this rationing. But what if this doesnât work? What if youâve had your fill of the mooing cow on Minecraft? What if the constant whine of âitâs my go on the Xboxâ gets too much? Simply remove the fuse from the plug and blame a loose wire. Restore it after a few weeks, while warning that it could go again at any time. Simples, as one pre-teen known to The Online News would say. Food Month Whetting the appetite Clodagh McKenna shared her secret kitchen tips, Patrick Freyne learned how to stop burning things, Catherine Cleary gave us a guide to reviewing restaurants and Ronan McGreevy angered the vegetarians of Ireland: all of this was part of The Online News Food Month, which ends today. The initiative, a combination of daily news, features, social media campaigns, reader events, parties and a live radio broadcast in association with The Ian Dempsey Show on Today FM, is the first such project by The Online News.

Clean sweep impossible - Mourinho Clean sweep impossible - Mourinho Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho says his side have little chance of winning all four major trophies this season. The Blues are seven points clear in the league after beating Middlesbrough, and into the Carling Cup semi-finals and the Champions League knockout stages. "We want to win something, but I think it is impossible to win all four trophies," Mourinho admitted. "But we have a good squad and we are trying. We have the FA Cup on Saturday and the Carling Cup next week." Despite a long injury list and a demanding schedule, Mourinho insists he will take each competition seriously. Chelsea face Scunthorpe on Saturday and he added: "We have watched them like we watch any other team. "We may change a few players for the game, if we can find any to change, butwe will play to win the FA Cup. We will play to win the Carling Cup. "Winning the Premiership or the Champions League is more important but wewill not turn any trophy down." The Premiership leaders have conceded only eight goals in 22 games and assistant boss Steve Clarke says that has put them on course for the title. "We can be a big threat because we've got great attacking players. But everything we've done has been based on a solid defence," he said. "It's the standard we've set for ourselves. Before the Christmas period we set ourselves a target of 12 points, we've got those 12 points so we're very happy. "We've said right from the start of the season that's our aim - we want to be champions. "There's a long way to go. We're out in front, we're enjoying being out in front and we're just focused on what we've got to do." Return to results
Clyde 0-5 Celtic Clyde 0-5 Celtic Celtic brushed aside Clyde to secure their place in the Scottish Cup semi-final, but only after a nervy and testing first half. The home side's Craig Bryson had a goal chopped off before Stan Varga headed Celtic into the lead. Alan Thompson scored from the penalty spot at the start of the second half after Shaun Maloney had been fouled. Stilian Petrov slid in a third, Varga tapped in his second and Craig Bellamy completed the rout with a fine drive. Bryn Halliwell was the busier keeper early on, saving from Bellamy, Chris Sutton and Juninho. Clyde had the ball in the net after half-an-hour through a tremendous strike from Bryson, but the referee had already blown for a foul by Petrov. From the resulting free kick, Darren Sheridan curled the ball round the Celtic wall only for the post to deny him. Back at the other end, Halliwell did well to come off his line and block Bellamy's effort to lift the ball over him. The keeper misjudged a corner that Stephane Henchoz headed wide, but a similar scenario five minutes before the break led to the opening goal. The ball was delivered from the left and Halliwell was left floundering as Varga glanced the ball into the net. Maloney replaced the injured Sutton at half time and he marked his first competitive appearance after a year out injured by helping his side take a two-goal lead just after the break. The young striker fired a free kick straight into the Clyde wall but as he collected the rebound, he was tripped by Bryson and Thompson converted the penalty. Sheridan and Bellamy were involved in something of a flare-up that led to both being booked after the intervention of the assistant referee. Juninho brought out another good save from Halliwell and then Petrov saw a tremendous effort come off the top of the bar. But Petrov and Juninho combined brilliantly to allow the Bulgarian to make it 3-0 on the hour mark - a quick one-two giving him the time and space to steer the ball past Halliwell from 12 yards. Varga got his second goal of the game as Celtic drove home their advantage - Thompson whipped in a corner from the right and the unmarked defender simply tapped the ball over the line from a couple of yards out. Celtic were utterly dominant by this stage and Bellamy opened his scoring account for the club after a fine move involving Aiden McGeady, Jackie McNamara and Maloney culminated in the Welshman hammering the ball into the net. Halliwell kept the deficit at five by pushing a McGeady shot wide as the game petered out.

Cork-born business leaders gathered in City Hall yesterday for an economic conference as part of Reb... Cork-born business leaders gathered in City Hall yesterday for an economic conference as part of Rebel Week , a local authority-organised Gathering festival showcasing Cork which runs until Sunday. With just a hint of mischievousness, the organisers called it the âGlobalâ Cork Economic Forum. They must have forgotten to add a âBoyâ at the end. The website for Rebel Week also contains a self-deprecating nod to that chippy Second City Syndrome that sometimes afflicts the lovely Leesiders: a red banner proclaiming the Peopleâs Republic of Cork is emblazoned across the homepage. All in good spirits, of course. The event was chaired by John Mullins while the MC was broadcaster Matt Cooper, both well-known sons of Cork. Among the speakers were some of the best-known business figures in the State: Vodafone boss Anne OâLeary, Independent News & Media chairman Leslie Buckley , Tesco Ireland director Tony Keohane , and Patrick Coveney , the chief executive of Greencore . Mullins told me that the main message from the morning session was that Cork âneeds to understand that it is the second city, but that this has its advantagesâ when looking for investment. The need for an international fibre link into Cork was also a hot topic. It was suggested, tongue in cheek, by some panel members that a âred cardâ be issued to anyone who mentioned Dublin during the debates. Incidentally, Cork Airport is one of the Rebel Week sponsors. Now might not be a good time to mention that it is actually owned by the Dublin Airport Authority . Or that Coveney was last yearâs president of the Dublin Chamber of Commerce. .

Cudicini misses Carling Cup final Cudicini misses Carling Cup final Chelsea goalkeeper Carlo Cudicini will miss Sunday's Carling Cup final after the club dropped their appeal against his red card against Newcastle. The Italian was sent off for bringing down Shola Ameobi in the final minute of Sunday's match. Blues boss Jose Mourinho had promised to pick Cudicini for the final instead of first-choice keeper Petr Cech. The 31-year-old will now serve a one-match suspension commencing with immediate effect. Cudicini kept a club record 24 clean sheets last season for Chelsea, but Petr Cech has established himself as first choice for Mourinho since moving to Stamford Bridge in summer 2004. The 22-year-old Czech Republic international has set a new Premiership record of 961 consecutive minutes without conceding a goal, a mark which is still running. But Mourinho has used Cudicini regularly in the Carling Cup, and the Italian has only let in one goal in his four appearances during Chelsea's run to the final. Return to results
Dysfunctional banking system is biggest threat, Friends First economist warns Dysfunctional banking system is biggest threat, Friends First economist warns Friends First chief economist Jim Powerwarned that early signs of recovery in the Dublin property market are not reflective of the country as a whole. Photograph: Eric Luke/The Online News A dysfunctional banking system, a possible need for further capital for the sector, and dangerous levels of sovereign and personal debt are among the biggest risks to economic recovery in Ireland , the latest Friends First Economic Outlook has warned. Frailty of the euro zone banking system and tight credit conditions are the biggest external threats to recovery, the report from the life assurance company said. The publication anticipates an increase in GDP growth from 0.3 per cent in 2013 to 2.1 per cent in 2014, as well as a fall in unemployment from 13.3 per cent this year to 12.5 per cent next year. The companyâs chief economist Jim Power said that while the outlook for the Irish economy remains challenging, the country is experiencing a âmodest recoveryâ, and the forecast was more positive than it has been since 2008. âThe external environment is improving and provided policy makers continue to apply the appropriate stimulus, a gradual external recovery is now on the cards,â he said. Speaking today in Dublin, Mr Power said the credit freeze facing small and medium sized businesses is a âmajor source of concernâ, as the country needs the SME sector to expand if the economy is to recover. He also warned that early signs of recovery in the Dublin property market are not reflective of the country as a whole, and âare now being exploited by some with an interest in talking up the marketâ. âReal caution is now required before we talk ourselves into another bubble,â he said. âLet us not repeat the mistakes of the past.â Mr Power also warned of a âvery long and torturous path aheadâ for those involved in dealing with the mortgage arrears crisis. .

ECB survey uncovers differences in loan availability across euro area ECB survey uncovers differences in loan availability across euro area Financing conditions for small firms vary greatly within the 17-country euro region, a new survey has said, with half the smaller businesses in Greece, Spain and Italy saying access to finance was a âvery pressing problemâ. Photograph: Kiyoshi Ota/Online News Small businesses in the euro zone say it has become more difficult to get access to credit in the past six months, with great differences in loan availability across the region, the European Central Bank said today. In a survey on access to finance of small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), 12 per cent of survey participants reported that their loan applications had been rejected, compared with 11 per cent in the previous survey, conducted six months earlier. The ECB also said that financing conditions for small firms varied greatly within the 17-country region, with half the smaller businesses in Greece, Spain and Italy saying access to finance was a âvery pressing problemâ. Peer to peer lending could offer substantial returns and provide lifeline to SMEs Germany was the only country where bank loan availability improved in the April to September period form the previous six months. âEuro area SMEs also reported a marginal deterioration in the availability of bank loans,â the report said, and added that small firms in Italy, the Netherlands and Belgium said the deterioration of bank loan availability was accelerating. âThe percentage of SMEs reporting access to finance as their main problem remains broadly stable at 16 per cent,â it said. It showed that only a third of Greek and Dutch firms, which applied for a loan, received full approval, compared to four-fifths of those in Germany and Finland. The report also said that financing conditions were more difficult for small companies than for large ones, and that interest rates vary widely across the region and were rising in Spain and Italy. âMainly SMEs in Spain and Italy contributed, on balance, to the reported increase in bank lending rates, whereas SMEs in Germany and France indicated on balance a decline,â the survey said. The survey of 8,305 euro zone firms was conducted between August 28th and October 4th. (Online News) .

EU, Canada agree new trade deal EU, Canada agree new trade deal The pact will eliminate about 98 per cent of tariff lines on the first day of implementation European Commission president Jose Manuel Barroso poses with Canadian prime minister Stephen Harper ahead of todayâs meeting at the EU Commission headquarters in Brussels . Photograph: Francois Lenoir/Online News Canada and the European Union has today reached an âagreement in principleâ on a free-trade treaty that brings near an end to more than four years of negotiations. Canadian prime minister Stephen Harper and European Commission president Jose Barroso announced the agreement today following a meeting in Brussels. The pact, which would need the approval of EU national governments and the European Parliament, will eliminate about 98 per cent of all Canadian and EU tariff lines on the first day of its implementation. The sticking points have included Canadian access to the EUâs beef and pork markets and European access to Canadaâs dairy market as well as to Canadian public-procurement contracts at the sub-federal level. A free-trade agreement has been Mr Harperâs signature trade initiative as he seeks to diversify Canadaâs trade away from the US. Canada has relatively more to gain from a deal, according to a joint study released in 2008 . An agreement would increase annual Canadian gross domestic product by â¬8.2 billion, equivalent at the time to about 0.77 per cent of the countryâs output, the joint study showed. The EU economy would increase its annual output by â¬11.6 billion, or 0.08 per cent, according to the study. While the EU bought 8.9 per cent of Canadian exports in 2012, Canada represented 1.9 per cent of total EU exports, according to Statistics Canada and Eurostat data. The US received three-quarters of Canadaâs exports in August. The agreement moves beyond trade by including provisions on investment, government procurement and intellectual property, a key requirement for EU negotiators. Canada is opening up its procurement market to European companies and extending patent protection to its pharmaceutical companies. The pact includes an investment chapter that will provide investors with âgreater certainty, stability, transparency and protection for their investment,â according to a Canadian government statement. Canada still has the right to review EU investments to determine whether they are of ânet benefitâ to the country and meet national security requirements. The size threshold that triggers a government review of foreign acquisitions will be raised to C$1.5 billion for EU companies. Online News Comments are closed for this article.
Economic forecasters fail in constant refusal to learn from past Economic forecasters fail in constant refusal to learn from past From a policy point of view, there are some useful rules of thumb that provide better guidance than most complex models. The Bank of Englandâs Andrew Haldane, one of the most thoughtful central bankers around, has written extensively about this and persuasively argues for the adoption of simple but robust tools and techniques that, among other things, embody learning. Back in 2008, the queen of England famously asked a group of economists why they didnât see the financial crisis coming. It took them nearly eight months to formulate a reply. Their answer stated she was quite right to ask the question. I think this was wrong; the question missed an important point. More reasonable to ask would have been: âIn finance and economics, why canât we consistently forecast anything?â Perhaps the only honest answer to any question about the future is this: âwe donât knowâ. The puzzle is why the queen seems to think that experts know something about what is likely to happen next. It is not exactly news that forecasting is tough. Most forecasts are wrong, sometimes spectacularly so. When the euro was first introduced, I thought that that was the end of the exchange rate crises that had so bedevilled Europe . That bit of the forecast was right but I completely missed the (now) rather obvious point that financial crises can come in many forms, not just via the foreign exchanges. As the authors of the reply to the queen said, âmost were convinced that banks knew what they were doingâ. Fundamental flaws It seems that nobody can forecast. Ben Broadbent , of the Bank of England, is an example of a thoughtful economist who has explored just why this is so. Broadbent usefully points out the only reason stock prices and exchange rates change at all is because of forecasting errors. Any investment, in a sense, is a bet on somebody elseâs forecasting mistake. Forecasting is mostly a waste of time. Not because we are idiots but because finance is not physics: unlike the hard sciences, our tools, techniques and data are simply not up to the task of building accurate representations of how, in aggregate, the world works. We try, boy do we try. Physics envy has led to sophisticated mathematical models of the financial world. But those models donât work well, donât capture what we have just lived through. How to describe the mainstream approach? Consider this quote, taken from the International Monetary Fund website in a profile of one half of the now infamous Reinhart-Rogoff duo: â[Reinhart] does not fit the mould of the typical academic economist, who spends much of his or her time exploring pointless extensions of the dominant paradigm.â Think about that for a second. In dreaming of a glittering academic career, can we imagine anyone aspiring to spending their days over âpointless extensions of the dominant paradigmâ? Yet this is how at least one very well-respected academic sees his own profession (there are plenty of others who are similar). And the puzzle is why this has not led to a fundamental rethink of how economists ply their trade. The point is not that economists are fools. Typically, they are very smart (but occasionally prone to allowing ideology infect the maths). It is simply that what they are trying to do, particularly when it comes to forecasting, is so hard as to be next to impossible. It is quite wrong to berate them for forecasting mistakes. Itâs the lack of learning from forecast errors that astonishes. Future always uncertain Yet we still ask the dumb question: âWhat will happen tomorrow?â The smart question, âHow can I best think about an uncertain futureâ, is rarely asked. Honourable attempts are being made to learn. But my sense is they are still the exception not the rule. Paul Krugman is but one prominent critic bemused by the lack of learning in the face of models and their implied policies that have clearly failed â by forecasts that have been wrong. Most obviously, austerity hasnât delivered as forecast, yet few in authority seem too bothered by this. From a policy point of view, there are some useful rules of thumb that provide better guidance than most complex models. The Bank of Englandâs Andrew Haldane , one of the most thoughtful central bankers around, has written extensively about this and persuasively argues for the adoption of simple but robust tools and techniques that, among other things, embody learning. Right now, an obvious suggestion would be that if your policies are not working, try something else. Look at what is working elsewhere: in the US, they have sensible monetary policy, an absence of austerity (at least until the economy started to grow again). They have aggressively sorted out the banking system and a lot of personal debt has been written off. Itâs a formula that seems to work.

Edu blasts Arsenal Edu blasts Arsenal Arsenal's Brazilian midfielder Edu has hit out at the club for stalling over offering him a new contract. Edu's deal expires next summer and he has been linked with Spanish trio Real Madrid, Barcelona and Valencia. He told Online News Sport: "I'm not sure if I want to stay or not because the club have let the situation go on this far. "If they had really wanted to sign they should have come up with an offer six months before indicating they wanted to sign me and that's made me think." Edu's brother and representative Amadeo Fensao has previously said that Arsenal's current offer to the midfielder was well short of what he was seeking. And Edu, 26, added: "My brother is due to come to London on Thursday. "There is a meeting planned for 6 or 7 January to sort it out with Arsenal. "Now I have a choice to stay or go. I want to sort it out as soon as possible, that's in the best interests of both the club and myself. "I'm going to make my decision after the meeting later this week." Edu is now able to begin negotiations with other clubs because Fifa regulations allow players to start talks six months before their contracts expire. The midfielder, who broke in to the Brazilian national side in 2004, admitted he had been flattered to have been linked with the three Spanish giants. Edu said: "I've just heard stories from the news that the Madrid president Florentino Perez, the Valencia people, as well as Barcelona are interested. "That's nice, but I've never talked to them, so I can't say they want me sign 100%." Last month Wenger said he we was hopeful Edu would sign a new deal and played down suggestions that the lure of a club like Real Madrid would be too strong for Edu. Edu added that he had been encouraged by Wenger's support for him. "I still have a good relationship with Arsene Wenger - he's always said he wants me to sign." Return to results
England's defensive crisis grows England's defensive crisis grows England's defensive worries have deepened following the withdrawal of Tottenham's Ledley King from the squad to face Holland. Chelsea's John Terry and Wayne Bridge are also out, leaving coach Sven-Goran Eriksson with a real problem for Wednesday's match at Villa Park. Injured Rio Ferdinand and Sol Campbell were both left out of the squad, and Matthew Upson has already pulled out. Wes Brown and Jamie Carragher are likely to be the makeshift partnership. Terry, the captain of Chelsea as they push for the Premiership title, would have been a certain starter in the absence of Campbell and Ferdinand. But now he has pulled out with a bruised knee and is likely to be replaced by Carragher, alongside Brown. Manchester United's Brown last played for England in the defeat by Australia at Upton Park in February 2003. The 25-year-old was only called into the squad on Sunday night as cover following the enforced withdrawal of Upson, who has a hamstring injury. And Brown now looks certain to add to his tally of seven senior appearances for England. King was forced to pull out after his groin injury was assessed by England's medical staff. Eriksson has still not decided whether to call up any further back-up, having already summoned Phil Neville after Bridge pulled out with a foot injury.
Figure represents the lowest inflation rate since February 2010 Figure represents the lowest inflation rate since February 2010 The rate of inflation in the euro zone slowed last month, lessening the case for an interest rate change when the European Central Bank meets tomorrow. Official figures released yesterday showed that consumer prices rose by 1.1 per cent year-on-year in September, compared to an annual 1.3 per cent in the year to August. The inflation figure, which was lower than analysts had expected, represents the lowest inflation rate since February 2010, and is well below the ECBâs target of âclose to but belowâ 2 per cent. It was driven mostly by a 0.9 per cent drop in energy prices, while the rise in the cost of food, alcohol and tobacco also slowed last month. The figures come ahead of tomorrowâs monthly governing council meeting of the European Central Bank in Paris, one of two rate-setting meetings that take place outside Frankfurt each year. It is the first meeting since last monthâs much-anticipated Federal Reserve meeting at which the US bank announced it would not yet taper its quantitative easing programme. The move eases the pressure on Mario Draghi to introduce any stimulus measures when the governing council. The ECB president said last week that the Frankfurt-based bank would be prepared to intervene to keep market interest rates low if needed. Speaking last week, Mr Draghi said the bank could use a long term refinancing operation (LTRO), a form of long-term loans, if needed. âWe are ready to use any instrument...to maintain the short-term money market rates at a level which is warranted by our assessment of inflation in the medium-term,â he said. Mr Draghi is likely to be quizzed on next yearâs asset quality review of euro zone banks, as the ECB prepares to take direct supervisory control of around 130 banks. European unemployment Meanwhile, European unemployment figures due to be published today are expected to show no easing-off in the blocâs unemployment rate. Unemployment in the euro zone stood still at 12. 1 per cent in July, with unemployment across the 28-member European Union also flat compared to the previous month at 11 per cent. More than 28 million are out of work across the EU. In the under-25 age bracket, 24 per cent are unemployed in the euro zone and 23.4 per cent across the EU. Return to results
Fitzgerald defends location of new childrenâs hospital Fitzgerald defends location of new childrenâs hospital An Taisce calls on Government to move site from St Jamesâs to land beside the Coombe Minister for Children Frances Fitzgerald said the Government had taken âthe very best decisionsâ in relation to the location for the childrenâs hospital. File Photograph: Brenda Fitzsimons/The Online News Minister for Children Frances Fitzgerald has defended the Governmentâs decision to locate the new national childrenâs hospital at St Jamesâs Hospital . She was responding to a report in todayâs Online News [MON]that An Taisce had called on the Government to move the site from St Jamesâs to land beside the Coombe Hospital nearby. An Taisce had written to Taoiseach Enda Kenny saying the apparent failure to co-locate the hospital with a maternity hospital, as recommended in a number of expert reports, âsends alarm bells ringingâ. Ms Fitzgerald said the Government had taken âthe very best decisionsâ in relation to the location for the childrenâs hospital. âWe are committed to it. The money has been put aside and we are moving ahead with it,â she said. She denied that the failure to locate the new hospital on the site of a maternity hospital was an oversight. âObviously all these factors were considered and the very best decision was taken about the location of the childrenâs hospital. Whatâs important now is to get on with all of the issues to make sure that itâs delivered on target and thatâs the Governmentâs intention.â The new hospital will bring together the three existing Dublin childrenâs hospitals at Crumlin, Tallaght and Temple Street. Eilish Hardiman started work as chief executive of the Childrenâs Hospital Group on Friday and work has started to decant existing activities on the site at the west end of St Jamesâs in order to make way for the new building. .

Free care for under-fives may be inequitable but will bolster future health of nation Free care for under-fives may be inequitable but will bolster future health of nation While lack of means testing raises issues of fairness, the gift will please voters The early years are the time to catch problems before they develop or worsen, and family doctors are brilliantly placed to perform this work. Free GP care for under-fives is a vote-winning proposal with serious health advantages and an ethical question mark. Just as with free university fees, the brainchild of another Labour-tinged administration a generation ago, the idea of getting the State to pick up the tab every time a toddler goes to the doctor has the virtue of simplicity and saleability. It allows Government politicians to point to a single, clearly defined achievement in health to offset the many problems and crises in the system. And when they do so at future elections, they know from past experience that it will play particularly well on the doorstep with the middle classes who are most likely to vote. But just as with free college fees, moral and practical issues arise. The most obvious is the lack of equity involved in providing an important service free to wealthy families when many others are struggling financially. Is it right to subvent the health needs of the children of millionaires when families on relatively small incomes find it impossible to get a medical card? The unfairness involved will be keenly felt by people with serious illnesses such as cancer or motor neurone disease who are finding it difficult to get or keep a medical card. Almost 200,000 cards have been taken out of the system in the past year as discretion is redefined in the most minimal terms. Aggrieved parents Parents of children with long-term illnesses, who were promised medical cards in the programme for government, will also feel aggrieved. The Government will point out that the proposal is but a way-station on the road to free GP care for all, promised by 2015, so any unfairness will be shortlived. The plan to extend coverage by age, starting with young children, was developed by junior health minister Alex White after legal difficulties sank earlier proposals to first provide cards to people with long-term illnesses. Whiteâs proposal was approved by the Cabinet subcommittee on health last July and managed to survive the pre-budget haggling of recent weeks. In fact, it has been extended to embrace children aged five and under, and not just under-fives as originally envisaged. Legislation will be needed before todayâs announcement becomes a reality and GPs have to be brought on side. Remarkably, no talks have been held with the Irish Medical Organisation and it is unclear what use they would serve in advance of a court test of competition law due to be heard next year. Todayâs budget speech is unlikely to specify an implementation date, as this would only serve to increase GPsâ bargaining power. In health terms, there are clear advantages to measures that make it easier for small children to see a GP. If all the doctor does is weigh the child in those formative early years of life, the result will be a healthier population. The early years are the time to catch problems before they develop or worsen, and family doctors are brilliantly placed to perform this work. Another attraction of the proposal is the low cost involved. A recent report by TCD researchers for the Adelaide Hospital Society put the cost of providing GP visit cards to under-fives at â¬48 million. The cost of providing full GP cards was estimated at â¬57 million and the report says âit must be wondered what the benefit to society would be to withhold the full medical cards from children in favour of free access to GPs onlyâ. Why not all children? The report points out that it actually gets cheaper to cover the age group from five years to 15. The cost of providing full medical cards to all children in the State is estimated at â¬160 million. This is a drop in the ocean in a â¬13 billion health budget. It all sounds too good to be true. Many hard-pressed families will be hoping today that, unlike âfreeâ third-level education, free GP care turns out to be what it claims to be. .

Freeze on anti-spam campaign Freeze on anti-spam campaign A campaign by Lycos Europe to target spam-related websites appears to have been put on hold. Earlier this week the company released a screensaver that bombarded the sites with data to try to bump up the running costs of the websites. But the site hosting the screensaver now displays a pink graphic and the words "Stay tuned". No one at Lycos was available for comment on latest developments in its controversial anti-spam campaign. Lycos Europe's "Make love not spam" campaign was intended as a way for users to fight back against the mountain of junk mail flooding inboxes. People were encouraged to download the screensaver which, when their PC was idle, would then send lots of data to sites that peddle the goods and services mentioned in spam messages. Lycos said the idea was to get the spam sites running at 95% capacity and generate big bandwidth bills for the spammers behind the sites. But the plan has proved controversial. Monitoring firm Netcraft analysed response times for some of the sites targeted by the screensaver and found that a number were completely knocked offline. The downing of the sites could dent Lycos claims that what it is doing does not amount to a distributed denial of service attack. In such attacks thousands of computers bombard sites with data in an attempt to overwhelm them. Laws in many countries do not explicitly outlaw such attacks but many nations are re-drafting computer use laws to make them specific offences. Lycos Europe now appears to have put the plan on hold. The site hosting the screensaver currently shows a holding page, with the words, "Stay tuned". The numerical internet address of the site has also changed. This is likely to be in response to spammers who have reportedly redirected traffic from their sites back to the Lycos screensaver site. The campaign has come under fire from some corners of the web. Many discussion groups have said that it set a dangerous precedent and could incite vigilantism. "Attacking a spammer's website is like poking a grizzly bear sleeping in your back garden with a pointy stick," said Graham Cluley, senior technology consultant for Sophos. "Not only is this screensaver similar in its approach to a potentially illegal distributed denial of service attack, but it also is in danger of turning innocent computer users into vigilantes, who may not be prepared for whatever retaliation the spammers care to dream up."

French unemployment rate hits 16-year high of 10.9% French unemployment rate hits 16-year high of 10.9% Latest jobless figures adds to pressure on Hollande in his battle to get unemployment down French president Francois Hollande is struggling to live up to a pledge to get unemployment firmly on a downward trend by year end. Photograph: Etienne Laurent/Online News Franceâs jobless rate inched up in the third quarter to a 16-year high of 10.9 percent, adding to pressure on president Francois Hollande in his battle to get unemployment falling. The increase in unemployment, measured according to the International Labour Organisationâs (ILO) criteria, brought the jobless rate closer to an all-time high for France of 11.2 per cent reached in 1997. The rate was 10.8 per cent in the second quarter, revised down from 10.9 per cent in an initial estimate, the INSEE statistics agency said. His economic credibility on the line, Mr Hollande is struggling to live up to a pledge to get unemployment firmly on a downward trend by year end. Monthly jobless claims for October offered a ray of hope for the unpopular president, slipping back from a record the previous month. Nonetheless, corporate layoffs continue to dominate French media headlines and concerns about unemployment are weighing on consumer confidence, according to the latest surveys. INSEE said the unemployment rate for mainland France, which excludes Franceâs overseas territories and is more closely followed domestically than the overall rate, rose to 10.5 in the third quarter from 10.4 per cent in the previous three months.

Funds down after revelations of top-up payments to CRC executives Funds down after revelations of top-up payments to CRC executives Fundraising Ireland says revelations having a âdisproportionate and unfair impactâ on efforts of charities Lorraine Dempsey of the Special Needs Parents Association: said parents who had actively fundraised for the organisation did so in the belief that money raised would give their children a better chance of accessing services. Photograph: Cyril Byrne/The Online News Charities have reported a drop in donations which they have attributed to revelations that money raised through fundraising were used to top up payments to executives in the Central Remedial Clinic (CRC). Fundraising Ireland, an umbrella organisation for professional fundraisers including a number of well-known Irish charities, has said its members were reporting people cancelling their charitable donations and that appeal funds were down. Chief executive Anne Hanniffy said the revelations were having a âdisproportionate and unfair impactâ on the funding efforts of charities and people reliant on such charities. She made her comments after it emerged that money raised by charitable company Friends and Supporters of the Remedial Clinic, which generates funds from a lottery, were used to top up the salaries of senior staff at the CRC. âThis is concerning for hard- pressed organisations so openly reliant on public generosity and support,â Ms Hanniffy said. âIt is doubly concerning when the source of peopleâs frustration is an issue which has absolutely nothing to do with the way in which the vast majority of high quality not-for-profit organisations are funded and operated.â She said Fundraising Ireland believed transparency, accountability and regulation were vital to any institution. âWe owe it to donors that their money goes where they expect it to go.â The chief executive and founder of the Jack and Jill Foundation, Jonathan Irwin , posted an open letter to the charityâs supporters in which he described the revelations around top-ups as âdamagingâ. In it he set out his own salary, which stands at just under â¬90,000, and assured supporters he got âno top-up payments, no bonus, no pensionâ. âThe bottom line is that without the generosity of the general public we would not exist,â the letter said, while urging the charityâs supporters to continue to donate to the charity. Meanwhile, a group representing the parents of special needs children, including those whose children have attended the CRC, said parents felt âbetrayedâ following the revelations that fundraising money raised by the Friends and Supporters of the Remedial Clinic went for staff remuneration. Lorraine Dempsey of the Special Needs Parents Association said parents who had actively fundraised for the organisation did so in the belief that money raised would help increase the numbers of staff providing therapeutic interventions, thereby giving their children a better chance of accessing services. âThey were always under the assumption that the money being raised went directly to children and adult services provided by the CRC.â Ms Dempsey said that there was a need for transparency across the sector and for such organisations to be regulated. âWeâre calling for greater transparency within this whole sector. We donât have a charity regulator, we definitely need one. Organisations involved in fundraising need to be transparent with the public.â Meanwhile the chairman of the Public Accounts Committee , John McGuinness, has called on the CRC to âcome cleanâ on the payments to staff that were funded by donations. âThe revelations about the misuse of charitable donations by the CRC to top up the salaries of staff at the company is deeply concerning.â Mr McGuinness said the committee was awaiting a report from the HSE around the CRCâs funding, which it expected to receive within the next week. âIf we find it unsatisfactory we will call the CRC to appear before us. âBefore that I am calling on the CRC to make a comprehensive statement and come clean on the payments to staff that were funded by charitable donations. âThis statement must be full and frank and cover every aspect of their funding and where the money is going. âThis is a source of considerable public concern and needs to be addressed with the utmost urgency. The behaviour by the CRC is simply not good enough, the public will not accept it and I will not accept it. âPeople give their hard-earned money to charity with the expectation, in this instance, that it goes towards children and adults with a range of disabilities. This is a gross breach of public trust, and the CRC must now explain itself in an open and transparent way.â Comments are closed for this article.
Gadget market 'to grow in 2005' Gadget market 'to grow in 2005' The explosion in consumer technology is to continue into 2005, delegates at the world's largest gadget show, in Las Vegas, have been told. The number of gadgets in the shops is predicted to grow by 11%, while devices which talk to each other will become increasingly important. "Everything is going digital," Kirsten Pfeifer from the Consumer Electronics Association, told the Online News News website. The Consumer Electronics Show (CES) featured the pick of 2005's products. "Consumers are controlling what they want and technologies like HDTVs [high-definition TVs], digital radio, and digital cameras will remain strong in 2005. "All the products on show really showed the breadth and depth of the industry." Despite showing diversity, some delegates attending complained that the showcase lacked as much "wow factor" as in previous years. The portable technologies on show also reflected one of the buzzwords of CES, which was the "time and place shifting" of multimedia content - being able to watch and listen to video and music anywhere, at any time. At the start of last year's CES, the CEA predicted there would be an average growth of 4% in 2004. That figure was surpassed with the rise in popularity of portable digital music players, personal video recorders and digital cameras. It was clear also that gadgets are becoming a lot more about lifestyle choice, with fashion and personalisation becoming increasingly key to the way gadgets are designed. Part of this has been the rise in spending power of the "generation X-ers" who have grown up with technology and who now have the spending power and desire for more devices that suit them. More than 57% of the consumer electronics market is made up of female buyers, according to CEA research. Hybrid devices, which combine a number of multimedia functions, were also in evidence on the show floor. "A lot of this is driven by just the ability to do it," said Stephen Baker, a consumer electronics analyst with retail research firm NPD Group. "Some of these functions cost next to nothing to add." As well as the show floor showcasing everything from tiny wearable MP3 players to giant high-definition TVs, several keynote speeches were made by industry leaders, such as Microsoft chief Bill Gates. Despite several embarrassing technical glitches during Mr Gate's pre-show speech, he announced several new partnerships - mainly for the US market. He unveiled new ways of letting people take TV shows recorded on personal video recorders and watch them back on portable devices. He disappointed some, however, by failing to announce any details of the next generation of the Xbox games console. Another disappointment was the lack of exposure Sony's new portable games device, the PSP, had at the show. Sony said the much-anticipated gadget would most likely start shipping in March for the US and Europe. It went on sale in Japan before Christmas. There were only two PSPs embedded in glass cabinets at the show though and no representatives to discuss further details. A Sony representative told the Online News News website this was because Sony did not consider it to be part of their "consumer technology" offering. Elsewhere at the show, there was a plethora of colour and plasma screens, including Samsung's 102-inch (2.6 metre) plasma - the largest in the world. Industry experts were also excited about high-definition technologies coming to the fore in 2005, with new formats for DVDs coming out which will hold six times as much data as conventional DVDs. With so many devices on the move there were a lot of products on show offering external storage, like Seagate's 5GB pocket sized external hard drive, which won an innovation for engineering and design prize. More than 120,000 trade professionals attended CES in Las Vegas, which officially ran from 6 to 9 January. Comments are closed for this article.
Gadgets galore on show at fair Gadgets galore on show at fair The 2005 Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas is a geek's paradise with more than 50,000 new gadgets and technologies launched during the four-day event. Top gadgets at the show are highlighted in the Innovations Showcase, which recognises some of the hottest developments in consumer electronics. The Online News News website took an early pre-show look at some of those technologies that will be making their debut in 2005. One of the key issues for keen gadget users is how to store all their digital images, audio and video files. The 2.5GB and 5GB circular pocket hard drive from Seagate might help. The external USB drive won a CES best innovations design and engineering award and is small enough to slip into a pocket. "It is the kind of storage that appeals to people who want their PCs to look cool," said Seagate. "It is all about style but it also has lots of functionality." "It is the first time you can say a hard drive is sexy," it said. In the centre of the device is a blue light that flashes while data is being written to ensure users do not unplug it when it is busy saving those precious pictures. Universal Electronics' NevoSL is a universal controller that lets people use one device to get at their multimedia content, such as photos, no matter where it is in their house. It can also act as a remote for home theatre and stereo systems. Working with home broadband networks and PCs, the gadget has built-in wireless and a colourful, simple interface. Paul Arling, UEI chief, said consumers face real problems when trying to get at all the files they own that are typically spread across several different devices. He said the Nevo gave people a simple, single way to regain some control over digital media in the home. The Nevo won two awards at CES, one as a Girl's Best Friend award and another for innovation, design and engineering. The gadget is expected to go on sale before the summer and will cost about $799 (Â£425). Hotseat is targeting keen gamers with money to spend with its Solo Chassis gaming chair. The specially-designed chair lets gamers play in surround-sound while stretching out in their own "space". It is compatible with all the major games consoles, DVD players and PCs. "We found that kids love playing in surround sound," said Jay LeBoff from Hotseat. "We are looking at offering different types of seats, depending on the market success of this one." The chair also lets people experience surround sound while watching videos, with wireless control for six surround sound speakers. And a drinks holder. The chair, which looks like a car seat on a skeletal frame, should go on sale in April and is expected to cost $399 (Â£211). Satellite radio is big business in the US. In the UK, the digital radio technology is known as DAB and works on slightly different technology. Eton Corporation's Porsche designed P7131 digital radio set will be launched both as a DAB radio in the UK as well as a satellite radio set in the US. DAB sets have been slow to take-off in the UK, but this one concentrates on sleek looks as much as technology. "It is for the risqu&#233; consumer," said an Eton spokesperson. "We are proud of it because it has the sound quality for the audiophile and the looks for the design-conscious consumer." The Porsche radio is set to go on sale at the end of January in the US and in the first quarter of 2005 in the UK. In the US is it expected to cost $250 (Â£133). The average person has a library of 600 digital images estimates the Consumer Electronics Association, the organisation behind CES. This is expected to grow to a massive 3,420 images - or 7.2GB - in five years' time. One gadget that might help swell that collection is Sanyo's tiny handheld VPC-C4 camcorder which is another innovation in design and engineering award winner. It combines high quality video and stills in a very small device. It takes MPEG4 video quality at 30 frames a second and has a four megapixel still camera. Images and video are stored on SD cards, which have come down in price in recent months. A 512MB card will store about 30 minutes of video and 420 stills. The device is so tiny it can be controlled with one thumb. Because images and video are stored on SD memory, it is portable to other devices and means other data like audio can be stored on the card too. Wearable technology has always promised much but failed to deliver because of lack of storage capability and poor design. MPIO's tiny digital USB music players come in an array of fashionable colours, taking a leaf out of the Apple iPod mini book of design and reflecting the desire for gadgets that look good. Slung on a cord, the player would not look too geeky dangling discreetly from the neck. Although the pendant design was launched three months ago, the device emphasises large storage as well as good looks for fashion-conscious gadget fiends. An even dinkier model, the FY500, comes out in May and will store about 256MB of music. The range of players recently won an International Forum design award 2005.

Government abandons plans to seek â¬100 million in payments from health insurers Government abandons plans to seek â¬100 million in payments from health insurers Reilly says gap in HSE budget would be addressed in supplement estimate It has been reported that the HSE director general Tony OâBrien had told the Minister in a letter accompanying the plan that proposed spending cuts on the medical card scheme was being taken âagainst the advice of the HSE and the Department of Healthâ. The Government has abandoned plans to seek more than â¬100 million from the health insurance industry in âaccelerated paymentsâ this year.The payment of this money â essentially an advance on income due for private patients treated in public facilities â had been viewed up to now as a key component in the HSE budget for this year. A spokesman for Minister for Health James Reilly confirmed last night that he had decided not to seek these payments from insurers. He said that any gap in the HSEâs budget for the year would be dealt with in a supplementary estimate to be brought before the Oireachtas shortly. The HSE financial deficit for the year is now expected to be in excess of â¬200 million. Last week The Online News reported that the health authority had told the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform that in a worst- case scenario, the deficit could reach â¬286 million or even more, depending on whether income due from the British department of health came in on target. Verification process It was also reported yesterday that as part of a verification process being carried out on the HSEâs service plan for 2014, it was now accepted in Government that the level of savings that would materialise from a âprobityâ examination of spending on the medical card scheme would generate far less than the â¬113 million set out in the budget. The HSE service plan, which was given to Dr Reilly last Monday, states that reductions of â¬113 million on spending on the medical card services and a further â¬20 million in savings in the overall primary care reimbursement area is being sought. The Online News reported on Saturday that the HSE director general Tony OâBrien had told the Minister in a letter accompanying the plan that proposed spending cuts on the medical card scheme was being taken âagainst the advice of the HSE and the Department of Healthâ. The service plan also proposes that health staff should be excluded from measures agreed by the Government that personnel across the public service who retire before next August could do so with their pensions calculated on the pre-pay cut salaries that applied before the Haddington Road agreement.

HSE to request increased staffing for maternity hospitals HSE to request increased staffing for maternity hospitals Dr Peter Boylan says HIQA report is an âappalling indictment of State failureâ Dr Peter Boylan clinical director of the National Maternity Hospital who said the HIQA report was an appalling indictment of State failures over many years. Photograph: Brenda Fitzsimons/The Online News The Health Service Executive is to request an increase in staffing for maternity services following the publication of a report which found significant deficiencies in the care of critically ill women in the Stateâs 19 maternity hospitals. HSE National Director of Quality and Patient Safety Dr Philip Crowley said this morning that it was recognised âif you have adequate staffing levels in terms of midwives and consultants we can provide a more consultant-led serviceâ. He said the current maternity service numbers do not allow for that and that a request in relation to increased staffing would be made to the Minister for Health. He was responding to comments from the clinical director of the National Maternity Hospital who said staffing levels in Irish maternity hospitals were unacceptably low. The Health Information and Quality Authority report into the death of Savita Halappanavar published yesterday found significant deficiencies in the care of critically ill women in maternity hospitals. It pointed to 13 âmissed opportunitiesâ that, had they been identified and acted upon, could have resulted in a different outcome for Ms Halappanavar, who died in University Hospital Galway last October. Hiqa identified shortcomings in maternity care generally and has called for a national review of maternity services. Dr Boylan described the report as an âappalling indictment of State failures over many yearsâ in the provision of a safe maternity service infrastructure, with the lack of staff a key issue. âIf you take the minimum recommended number of consultant obstetricians for the number of births, not including gynaecology, there should be at least 200 in the state, but thereâs 120, so we are far behind.â âIn the National Maternity Hospital we have the equivalent of eight consultants, whereas if we were in Denmark or Norway or Sweden, weâd have about 50.â He also said staffing levels in Irish maternity hospitals are 30 per cent lower than recommended international standards. Mr Boylan also identified a number of failings in the HIQA report, including that while it identified failings in the care of Ms Halappanavar, it did not state what staff in University Hospital Galway should have done differently in this case. He also said the law on terminations âundoubtedly inhibitedâ the medical team in Galway from intervening and delivering Ms Halappanavar when intervention by delivery would have saved her life. Dr Boylan said this aspect was âdeliberately left out of the reportâ because the question was not asked because it was not in the terms of reference and that this was a âdeliberate omission on the part of the HSE which commissioned the report.â âThe State commissioned the report but didnât ask the obvious question,â he told RTÃâs Morning Ireland.

Health chief says medical card cuts âagainst HSE adviceâ Health chief says medical card cuts âagainst HSE adviceâ Letter to Reilly seen as attempt to deflect blame for proposed cuts from HSE Minister for Health Dr James Reilly. The director general of the HSE Tony OâBrien has told the Government that deep cuts that are to be implemented in spending on medical card services next year are being taken âagainst the advice of the HSE and the Department of Healthâ. The comments are contained in a confidential letter sent Minister for Health James Reilly last Monday that accompanied the HSEâs service plan for 2014. Highly-placed sources said that in the seven-page covering letter, Mr OâBrien maintained that the plan provided for cuts in spending of â¬133 million on medical cards â higher than the â¬113 million in cuts which had previously been suggested. However the tone of the letter has been interpreted by some in Government as Mr OâBrien signalling that he did not agree with the scale of the proposed cuts and that the responsibility for any fallout from the measures would lie elsewhere, other than in the HSE. The HSE has been asked to make overall savings of â¬666 million next year. There has already been considerable controversy this year over medical cards with the opposition claiming that thousands of people have had these withdrawn. The Government has argued that there has been no change in policy on medical cards. In the budget the Government set a target for the HSE to generate savings of â¬113 million on medical cards next year. Elsewhere Mr OâBrien indicated that while the Haddington Road agreement would deliver savings on payroll costs next year, a plan would need to be developed to realise significant amounts of the â¬248 million which the Government had sought to be generated. Pensions The letter has raised eyebrows in some quarters of the Government, where it is considered as an attempt to refight the recent rows over the spending estimates for 2014. The Online News has learned the service plan also proposes that health staff should be excluded from measures agreed by the Government that personnel across the public service who retire before next August can do so with their pensions calculated on the pre-pay cut salaries that applied before the Haddington Road agreement. The plan proposes that HSE management should be permitted to assign a specific date for staff who want to retire rather than having potentially large numbers departing at the same time next summer. The move is aimed at generating savings on the payment of lump sums for retiring personnel. Sources said the HSE also indicated in the plan that it would not be in a position to provide planned follow-up care for women who received faulty breast implants. The Department of Health said a review of the plan was ongoing. Comments are closed for this article.
Highbury will be our Cup final Highbury will be our Cup final Arsenal is a very special place for me because it is one of the few away games I remember going to when I was a boy. I can't remember what the year was but I was so young I was in short trousers. My father worked for English Steel Corporation, he was a crane driver and worked 12-hour shifts. Every year they had a trip to London and in this particular year they were going to London to watch Arsenal play. I remember him smuggling me on to the bus then into the Imperial Hotel, which I remember vividly, and then smuggling me over the turnstiles at Highbury. I remember looking across at the massive clock which has gone now and it is a memory I will never forget. It was a marvellous game, the Arsenal fans were absolutely brilliant and all the Sheffield United fans mixed with them. We lost 1-0 but our centre-half Joe Shaw was, for me, the best player in the world that day. On Saturday my son, who at three-and-a-half-years is a similar age to what I was, is going to be on the pitch before the game, while my daughter is the mascot. I think it will have the same effect on him - I don't think you forget things like that. I think the next time I went to Highbury was when I took a team there. When I was at Notts County we went there in the top flight and lost 2-0, but I took Huddersfield down there for the second leg of the League Cup and got a draw. I think they expected to get a cricket score because they beat us 5-0 in the first leg. Ian Wright was in the team and George Graham made one or two comments that made us pretty determined and had they not equalised late on we would have won that leg. They are a club I admire a lot. After we played Arsenal in the semi-final in 2003 the number of letters and messages I got from Arsenal fans regarding the behaviour of our fans and our team was quite outstanding and it just shows they are a great set of supporters. Everybody will be making an issue of that game at Old Trafford. I felt personally hard done by. You don't mind getting beat but in this particular case I think everybody saw their goal - scored by Freddie Ljungberg - was a travesty and should not have been allowed. I got fined for comments I made about referee Graham Poll, though I would not take any of those back. But that's how it has gone for us. The higher you go means you have to have Premier League referees and we have never really done very well with them. I would have liked a Football League official but Neale Barry, who is an experienced referee, has been awarded the game and you have to get on with it. That said, I think we will need more than help from the referee on Saturday after watching them demolish Crystal Palace on Monday. I turned it off after they scored three goals in about eight minutes and watched Bambi with the kids. Since I have watched the Premiership there have been a number of players who I think have been absolutely out of this world and would have paid anything to watch. One was Eric Cantona and another was Gianfranco Zola, who I thought was absolutely fantastic. Arsenal have two of those type of players. I still cannot believe some of Dennis Bergkamp's touches. His movement, footballing brain and awareness - and at nearly 36 - is incredible. I don't think any adjective is good enough to describe Thierry Henry. For me he is the Rolls Royce of Arsenal and the Premiership itself. No doubt they will be thinking of resting a few players for their Champions League game on Tuesday, but I am doing the same for our Championship game with Plymouth! That is a far more important game for us. Arsenal is like our Cup final, I feel like we have already got to the final - we have earned the money we set out to earn for the club and now we can enjoy our day out. Plymouth is the next big game for me and we have to be ready for that. Whatever team Arsenal play it is going to be a hell of a difficult task to get anything - we are just thinking about being respectable. After looking at Palace the other night I think you will probably get odds of 100-1 for us to win - and that's in a two-horse race. People ask me if we have done anything different in our preparations this week? We have...nothing! The players have been too exhausted after playing for almost an hour with 10 men on Sunday that they have not been able to do anything. They have done stretches and warm downs but very little football because of tiredness. On Thursday we will work on something but when it comes to dealing with Bergkamp and Henry I will probably say to my defenders just close your eyes and get your fingers crossed. When they are on their game there is not much you can do about them. Comments are closed for this article.
Honohan says Government is right to exit bailout without credit line Honohan says Government is right to exit bailout without credit line Fiscal discipline key to keeping finances on an even keel, says Central Bank governor Governor of the Central Bank of Ireland Patrick Honohan: âI actually favour the clean exit though a case can be made for the other approach.â Photograph: Gareth Chaney Collins Colin Gleeson The governor of the Central Bank Patrick Honohan has said he is in favour of the Governmentâs decision to exit the bailout without a credit line. Speaking on RTEâs Prime Time last night, he said there were risks attached â but that there are âways of protecting against risksâ. âI actually favour the clean exit though a case can be made for the other approach,â he said. âWeâve come to the end of an important stage in the restabilisation of the Irish economy. Going ahead now there are a lot of other things that help us move forward apart from a precautionary credit line for another year. âI volunteered my advice to Michael Noonan. I gave a balance between two options. In no way was it like the last time three years ago. I wasnât saying this is definitely the way to go one way or the other. âI felt the Government could choose between the options here and I waited to see what they would say. They opted for a clean exit and actually I would have done the same for Ireland.â Asked about the practical benefits of exiting the bailout without a credit line, Mr Honohan said it was a âstatement of intentâ from the Government before entering the markets. âFrom now on we are dealing with markets and convincing markets that we, Ireland, are credit-worthy and a credible counterpart. This is a statement of intent that the Government intends to continue on a path of discipline in its approach and action to support economic recovery. âEconomic growth and fiscal disciple are the two things that keep our finances on an even keel. By going in this way, I think it helps convince the markets.â Mr Honohan said there are still many obstacles for Dublin to overcome in terms of ensuring a return to healthy economic growth for Ireland. âItâs a constant negative that growth is so much below potential in the Euro zone,â he said. âThere is no dispute about this. Six quarters of recession have been followed by two quarters of very low growth so that is a weak environment in which to sustain and build the Irish recovery.â In terms of when people on the ground might begin to see an improvement in their day-to-day lives, he said the signs were pointing in âa positive directionâ. âThe growth has started to recover. I donât want to be too optimistic but I have to say the signs are all in a positive direction. It isnât being felt by a large number of people. Some are feeling it but a large number are not and they will not get back to the living standards of five years ago â thatâs for sure â but the direction is positive on a range of fronts.â Comments are closed for this article.
Ireland âcajoled into taking one for the teamâ Ireland âcajoled into taking one for the teamâ Willem Buiter, global chief economist with Citigroup: âThey [Ireland] have been given a bit . . . but it doesnât add up to the extra burden put on the Irish taxpayerâ Christopher McKinley Ireland has an âexceptional claimâ to have its banks recapitalised by the European Stability Mechanism (ESM), the euro-zone bailout fund, according to Citigroup chief economist Willem Buiter . âThe Irish sovereign has on its books at least â¬30 billion â possibly up to â¬60 billion â worth of debt that is only there because Ireland was cajoled [and] forced into taking one for the team,â he said yesterday at an Irish Life pension conference in Convention Centre Dublin. Mr Buiter said that in 2010 the Government wanted to âbail-inâ Anglo-Irish Bank, forcing the bankâs creditors, including senior bondholders, to absorb some of the lenderâs losses by having part of the debt they were owed written off. However, Mr Buiter said Ireland was urged not to do so by Germany, the United States and the then head of the European Central Bank , Jean-Claude Trichet. âI think Europe owes Ireland somewhere between â¬30 and â¬60 billion,â he said, adding that he hoped the continent would âcough upâ. âThey [Ireland] have been given a bit . . . but it doesnât add up to the extra burden put on the Irish taxpayer,â he said. Last week German finance minister Wolfgang SchÃ¤uble reiterated the countryâs opposition to using the ESM to recapitalise Irish banks directly. Mr Buiter said he expected European leaders to reconsider their stance and noted that Ireland should seek to enter another back-up or âprecautionaryâ bailout programme when it exits its current one at the end of this year. He said that when somebody offers you a âvirtually free option which gives you free insuranceâ it would take a brave person to turn it down. âBelt and braces are better than braces alone,â he said. âIreland would be well advised to take the insurance of a light precautionary standby programme.â Comments are closed for this article.
Liver disease specialist Dr Sanjeev Arora set up project Echo. Liver disease specialist Dr Sanjeev Arora set up project Echo. Christopher McKinley Waiting lists for rheumatology consultants could be significantly reduced by an online initiative to treat patients, which will be launched in Kildare tomorrow. Some 20 GPs around Ireland will be taught best-practice methods for treating conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis through video-conferencing with specialists and experts operating out of Connolly Hospital in Blanchardstown, Dublin 15. The initiative is part of project Echo (Extension for Community Healthcare Outcomes), which aims to improve healthcare for complex conditions in rural and distant communities all over the world. Liver disease specialist Dr Sanjeev Arora , who set up project Echo, said that this would create new âcentres of expertiseâ throughout the country which could reduce consultation waiting times to just âa few weeksâ. It is also believed that early treatment of conditions, along with reducing travel costs and the need to see specialists, could help to generate â¬20 million in savings. Quality of care Rheumatologist Dr Trevor Duffy , who will be guiding the project from Blanchardstown, believes the initiative will also lead to patients getting a better quality of care. More than 40 healthcare institutions worldwide have now used Echo to treat 15 different clinical specialities including asthma, pain and diabetes. When Dr Arora first established the project 10 years ago, it was designed to enhance treatment of hepatitis C. The disease affects about 170 million people worldwide, but only 2 per cent of patients are treated. There was an eight-month waiting list for patients attending Dr Aroraâs clinic at the University of New Mexico, a state where more than 35,000 people are affected. Dr Arora said that even though effective treatments existed, less than 5 per cent had received them and âpatients were dyingâ. At the time no GPs in the state were treating hepatitis C. Patients had to visit Dr Arora, or another specialist, on more than a dozen separate occasions so that they could receive the necessary injections. âPoor people couldnât get to see me because they would have often lived hundreds of miles away,â he told The Online News. âThey couldnât access it because of long waits and long distances to travel.â Dr Arora recruited 20 primary care providers, such as family physicians, to train to specialist level. A best practice protocol for treatment was created and shared with each of these people. Over the internet, they then co-managed their patients with specialists at the university. âWithin a year of doing this, they actually became experts,â Dr Arora said, adding that the level of care they delivered was as good as that delivered at the university clinic and better than the average specialist. âThen we tried it in rheumatology, substance use and mental health disorder. We found that it worked on many, many diseases,â he said. Dr Arora believes that using the Echo process to treat rheumatological conditions in Ireland could also be highly effective. Mental health The initiative will be launched when he addresses the National Primary Care Conference at Newbridge Primary Care Centre tomorrow, where a mental health care conference will also be taking place.
McLeish ready for criticism McLeish ready for criticism Rangers manager Alex McLeish accepts he is going to be criticised after their disastrous Uefa Cup exit at the hands of Auxerre at Ibrox on Wednesday. McLeish told Online News Radio Five Live: "We were in pole position to get through to the next stage but we blew it, we absolutely blew it. "There's no use burying your head in the sand, we know we are going to get a lot of criticism. "We have to take it as we have done in the past and we must now bounce back." McLeish admitted his team's defending was amateurish after watching them lose 2-0 to Guy Roux's French side. "I'm very disappointed because we didn't give ourselves a chance, losing the first goal from our own corner. It was amateur," he added. "The early goal in the second half gave us a mountain to climb and we never created the same kind of chances as we did in the first half. "It's difficult to take positives from the game. We've let the fans down." Return to results
Mexicans tracking unhappy Juninho Mexicans tracking unhappy Juninho Mexican outfit Red Sharks Veracruz hope to sign Juninho if the Brazilian decides to leave Celtic frustrated at his lack of first-team action. Their president, Gustavo Parente Sanchez, says Juninho "does not wish to remain in Scottish football anymore". Agent Brian Hassell insists that the 31-year-old Brazilian midfielder is determined to win back his place. "But, if the manager is not going to pick him, that's a different ball game," he told The Sun. "That's something we'd have to look at. Juninho deserves respect. He is not a little kid." Hassell warns that Juninho could reconsider his future at Celtic unless he is given a run of games by the end of the January transfer window. Juninho was signed from Middlesbrough during the summer, but he has failed to live up to high expectations and has lost his place to 18-year-old Aiden McGeady. "He has 50 caps for Brazil and he's the best signing Celtic ever made," insisted Hassell. "He wants to play for Martin O'Neill, but does Martin O'Neill want to play him? "Juninho is not someone who has come through the Celtic ranks. He deserves much more respect." Sanchez is bullish about his hopes of prising Juninho from the Scottish champions, although Hassell believes Mexico would not be his preferred destination. "We have already spoken with Juninho and he said, if he has no firm offer from a club in Spain, Veracruz will be his destination," Sanchez told his club's official website. Celtic manager O'Neill is no respecter of reputations. "The onus is on Juninho to force his way into the team," he said. "Players get a game on merit. That's the way it has always been and that is certainly the case at Celtic Park." Return to results
Millions to miss out on the net Millions to miss out on the net By 2025, 40% of the UK's population will still be without internet access at home, says a study. Around 23 million Britons will miss out on a wide range of essential services such as education and medical information, predicts the report by telecoms giant BT. It compares to 27 million, or 50%, of the UK, who are not currently online. The idea that the digital divide will evaporate with time is "wishful thinking", the report concludes. The study calls on the government and telecoms industry to come up with new ways to lure those that have been bypassed by the digital revolution. Although the percentage of Britons without home access will have fallen slightly, those that remain digital refuseniks will miss out on more, the report suggests. As more and more everyday tasks move online and offline services become less comprehensive, the divide will become more obvious and more burdensome for those that have not got net access, it predicts. The gap between "have-nets" and "have-nots" has been much talked about, but predictions about how such a divide will affect future generations has been less discussed. BT set out to predict future patterns based on current information and taking account of the way technology is changing. Optimists who predict that convergence and the emergence of more user-friendly technology will bridge the digital divide could be way off mark, the report suggests. "Internet access on other devices tends to be something taken up by those who already have it," said Adrian Hosford, director of corporate responsibility at BT. Costs of internet access have fallen dramatically and coverage in remote areas have vastly improved over the last year but the real barrier remains psychological. "There is a hard rump of have-nots who are not engaging with the net. They don't have the motivation or skills or perceive the benefits," said Mr Hosford. As now, the most disadvantaged groups are likely to remain among low income families, the older generation and the disabled. Those on low incomes will account for a quarter of the digital have-nots, the disabled will make up 16% and the elderly nearly a third by 2025, the report forecasts. Organisations such as BT have a responsibility to help tackle the problem, said Mr Hosford. The telco has seen positive results with its Everybody Online project which offers internet access to people in eight deprived communities around Britain. In one area of Cornwall with high levels of unemployment, online training helped people rewrite CVs and learn skills to get new jobs, explained Mr Hosford. Such grassroot activity addressing the specific needs of individual communities is essential is the problem of the digital divide is to be overcome, he said. "If we don't address this problem now, it will get a lot worse and people will find it more difficult to find jobs, education opportunities will be limited and they'll simply not be able to keep up with society," he said. The Alliance for Digital Inclusion, an independent body with members drawn from government, industry and the voluntary sector has recently been set up to tackle some of the issues faced by the digital refuseniks.

Mobile TV tipped as one to watch Mobile TV tipped as one to watch Scandinavians and Koreans, two of the most adventurous groups of mobile users, are betting on mobile TV. Anders Igels, chief executive of Nordic operator Teliasonera, tipped it as the next big thing in mobile in a speech at the 3GSM World Congress, a mobile trade fair, in Cannes this week. Nokia, the Finnish handset maker, is planning a party in Singapore this spring to launch its TV to mobile activities in the region. Consultancy Strategy Analytics of Boston estimates that mobile broadcast networks will have acquired around 51 million users worldwide by 2009, producing around $6.6bn (Â£3.5bn) in revenue. SK Telecom of South Korea, which is launching a TV to mobile service (via satellite) in May plans to charge a flat fee of $12 a month for its 12 channels of video and 12 channels of audio. It will be able to offer an additional two pay TV channels using conditional access technology. Mr Shin-Bae Kim, chief executive of SK Telecom, also at 3GSM, said: "We have plans to integrate TV with mobile internet services. "This will enable viewers to access the mobile internet to get more information on adverts they see on TV." There will be 12 handsets available for the launch of the Korean service. LG Electronics of South Korea was demonstrating one at 3GSM that could display video at 30 frames a second. Footage shown on the handset was clear and watchable. A speech on mobile TV by Angel Gambino of the Online News also drew a large crowd, suggesting that even those mobile operators and equipment vendors which are not particularly active in mobile TV yet are starting to look into it. But all is not simple and straightforward in the mobile TV arena. There is a battle for supremacy between two competing standards: DVB-H for Digital Video Broadcasting for Handsets and DMB for Digital Multimedia Broadcasting. Dr Chan Yeob Yeun, vice president and research fellow in charge of mobile TV at LG Electronics, said: "DMB offers twice the number of frames a minute as DVB-H and does not drain mobile batteries as quickly." The Japanese, Koreans and Ericsson of Sweden are backing DMB. Samsung of South Korea has a DMB phone too that will be one of those offered to users of the TU Media satellite mobile TV service to be launched in Korea in May. Nokia, by contrast, is backing DVB-H, and is involved in mobile TV trials that use its art-deco style media phone, which has a larger than usual screen for TV or visual radio (a way of accompanying a radio programme with related text and pictures). Mobile operators O2 and Vodafone are among the operators trialling mobile TV. But even if the standards battle is resolved, there is the thorny issue of broadcasting rights. Ms Gambino says the Online News now negotiates mobile rights when it is negotiating content. For those not convinced mobile users will want to watch TV on their handsets, Digital Audio Broadcasting may provide a good compromise and better sound quality than conventional radio. Developments in this area are continuing. At a DAB conference in Cannes, several makers of DAB chips for mobiles announced smaller, lower- cost chips which consume less power. Among the chip companies present were Frontier Silicon and Radioscape. The jury is still out on whether TV and digital radio on mobiles will make much money for anyone. But with many new services going live soon, it won't be long before the industry finds out. Return to results
Mobile games come of age Mobile games come of age The Online News News website takes a look at how games on mobile phones are maturing. A brief round-up follows but you can skip straight to the reviews by clicking on the links below. If you think of Snake when some mentions "mobile games" then you could be in for a bit of a surprise. This is because mobile games have come a long way in a very short time. Even before Nokia's N-Gage game phone launched in late 2003, many mobile operators were realising that there was an audience looking for something to play on their handset. And given that many more people own handsets than own portable game playing gadgets such as the GameBoy it could be a very lucrative market. That audience includes commuters wanting something to fill their time on the way home, game fans looking for a bit of variety and hard core gamers who like to play every moment they can. Life for all these types of player has got immeasurably better in the last year as the numbers of titles you can download to your phone has snowballed. Now sites such as Wireless Gaming Review list more than 200 different titles for some UK networks and the ranges suit every possible taste. There are ports of PC and arcade classics such as Space Invaders, Lunar Lander and Bejewelled. There are also versions of titles, such as Colin McRae Rally, that you typically find on PCs and consoles. There are shoot-em-ups, adventure games, strategy titles and many novel games only found on handsets. Rarely now does an action movie launch without a mobile game tie-in. Increasingly such launches are all part of the promotional campaign for a film, understandable when you realise that a good game can rack up millions of downloads. The returns can be pretty good when you consider that some games cost Â£5. What has also helped games on mobiles thrive is the fact that it is easier than ever to get hold of them thanks to technology known as Wap push. By sending a text message to a game maker you can have the title downloaded to your handset. Far better than having to navigate through the menus of most mobile operator portals. The number of handsets that can play games has grown hugely too. Almost half of all phones now have Java onboard meaning that they can play the increasingly sophisticated games that are available - even the ones that use 3D graphics. The minimum technology specifications that phones should adhere to are getting more sophisticated which means that games are too. Now double key presses are possible making familiar tactics such as moving and strafing a real option. The processing power on handsets means that physics on mobile games is getting more convincing and the graphics are improving too. Some game makers are also starting to take advantage of the extra capabilities in a mobile. Many titles, particularly racing games, let you upload your best time to see how you compare to others. Usually you can get hold of their best time and race against a "ghost" or "shadow" to see if you can beat them. A few games also let you take on people in real time via the network or, if you are sitting close to them, via Bluetooth short-range radio technology. With so much going on it is hard to do justice to the sheer diversity of what is happening. But these two features should help point you in the direction of the game makers and give you an idea of where to look and how to get playing. TOO FAST TOO FURIOUS (DIGITAL BRIDGES) As soon as I start playing this I remember why I never play driving games - because I'm rubbish at them. No matter if I drive the car via joystick or keypad I just cannot get the hang of braking for corners or timing a rush to pass other drivers. The game rewards replay because to advance you have to complete every section within a time limit. Winning gives you cash for upgrades. Graphically the rolling road is a convincing enough evocation of speed as the palm trees and cactus whip by and the city scrolls past in the background. The cars handle pretty well despite my uselessness but it was not clear if the different models of cars were appreciably different on the track. The only niggle was that the interface was a bit confusing especially when using a joystick rather than the keypad to play. FATAL FORCE (MACROSPACE) A futuristic shooter that lets you either play various deathmatch modes against your phone or run through a series of scenarios that involves killing aliens invading Earth. Graphics are a bit cartoon-like but only helps to make clear what is going on and levels are well laid out and encourage you to leap about exploring. Both background music and sounds effects work well. The scenarios are well scripted and you regularly get hints from the Fatal Force commanders. Weapons include flamethrowers, rocket launchers, grenades and at a couple of points you even get chance to use a mech for a short while. With the right power-up you can go into a Matrix-style bullet time to cope with the onslaught of aliens. The game lets you play via Bluetooth if others are in range. Online the game has quite a following with clans, player rankings and even new downloadable maps. Return to results
Molby says Gravesen is Real deal Molby says Gravesen is Real deal Jan Molby is convinced fellow Dane Thomas Gravesen will be a major success when he leaves Everton for Real Madrid. Gravesen is set to join the Spanish giants after the clubs agreed a Â£2m-plus fee for the player. Molby told Online News Sport: "It is a little bit of a surprise, but there is no doubt the talent is there with Thomas. "It is there for everyone to see. I'm sure he will do a good job. They will be looking for him to be the strong man, but he has exceptional ability." Gravesen is out of contract at the end of the season and would be able to leave on a free transfer but Real are expected to pay up to Â£2.5m to sign the midfielder in January. Molby said: "The strength of the majority of the players at Real is going forward, and maybe not having a lot of defensive qualities. "Thomas has been playing more of a free role this season at Everton, but when he plays for Denmark he has a lot of defensive duties and he can do that as well. "Real will want Thomas to sit in there and make them defensively sound, with all the superstars going forward. But he can be trusted with the ball, and if he does venture forward he is more than good enough to do some fancy work." Gravesen is a strong personality and a major figure at Everton - but he will be reduced to the ranks among the big names assembled at The Bernabeu. Molby said: "Thomas likes to be the leader and he wouldn't go down as a 'galactico' signing. "It will be interesting to see what happens the first time he gets upset with Zinedine Zidane, Ronaldo or Raul for not tracking back - but that's all part of the way he is. "He is a strong personality and he has to keep that if he is to function at 100%. But it is a once in a lifetime opportunity and I don't think he will spoil it by being too petulant. "He has had a very, very good season at Everton. I always felt he was a very good player, a better player than he had shown at Everton. "He has played well for Denmark at European Championships and World Cups and now he's showing that form for Everton. As Everton have progressed he's got better and better." Molby believes Everton's hopes of qualifying for Europe would be dealt a devastating blow if Gravesen leaves. He said: "It would be a massive, massive setback. People talk about the success of Tim Cahill, Lee Carsley playing well in the holding role, Marcus Bent's goals and the work of the defensive boys - but the catalyst is always Thomas Gravesen. "For Everton to lose Gravesen and that extra bit of quality he gives you that wins matches would be a real blow. There are not a lot of players around like that." But Molby said Gravesen's respect for Everton manager David Moyes means he may yet stay. He added: "If there are any doubts, then I know he really likes David Moyes and enjoys living on Merseyside. "I'm sure the two of them will have a chat, but it is always difficult to turn down Real Madrid." Return to results
More power to the people says HP More power to the people says HP The digital revolution is focused on letting people tell and share their own stories, according to Carly Fiorina, chief of technology giant Hewlett Packard. The job of firms such as HP now, she said in a speech at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES), was to ensure digital and physical worlds fully converged. She said the goal for 2005 was to make people the centre of technology. CES showcases 50,000 new gadgets that will be hitting the shelves in 2005. The tech-fest, the largest of its kind in the world, runs from 6 to 9 January. "The digital revolution is about the democratisation of technology and the experiences it makes possible," she told delegates. "Revolution has always been about giving power to the people." She added: "The real story of the digital revolution is not just new products, but the millions of experiences made possible and stories that millions can tell." Part of giving people more control has been about the freeing up of content, such as images, video and music. Crucial to this has been the effort to make devices that speak to each other better so that content can be more easily transferred from one device, such as a digital camera, to others, such as portable media players. A lot of work still needs to be done, however, to sort out compatibility issues and standards within the technology industry so that gadgets just work seamlessly, she said. Ms Fiorina's talk also touted the way technology is being designed to focus on lifestyle, fashion and personalisation, something she sees as key to what people want. Special guest, singer Gwen Stefani, joined her on-stage to promote her own range of HP digital cameras which Ms Stefani has helped design and which are heavily influenced by Japanese youth culture. The digital cameras, which are due to go on sale in the US by the summer, are based on the HP 607 model. The emphasis on personalisation and lifestyle is a big theme at this year's CES, with tiny, wearable MP3 players at every turn and rainbow hues giving colour to everything. Ms Fiorina also announced that HP was working with Nokia to launch a visual radio service for mobiles, which would launch in Europe early this year. The service will let people listen to radio on their mobiles and download relevant content, like a track's ringtone, simultaneously. The service is designed to make mobile radio more interactive. Among the other new products she showcased was the Digital Media Hub, a big upgrade to HP's Digital Entertainment Centre. Coming out in the autumn in the US, the box is a networked, high-definition TV, cable set-top box, digital video recorder and DVD recorder. It has a removable hard drive cartridge, memory card slots, and Light Scribe labelling software which lets people design and print customised DVD labels and covers. It is designed to contain all a household's digital media, such as pre-recorded TV shows, pictures, videos and music so it can all be managed in one place. The hub reflects the increasing move to re-box the PC so that it can work as part of other key centres of entertainment. Research suggests that about 258 million images are saved and shared every day, equating to 94 billion a year. Eighty per cent of those remain on cameras. Media hubs are designed to encourage people to organise them on one box. Ms Fiorina was one of several keynote speakers, who also included Microsoft chief Bill Gates, to set out what major technology companies think people will be doing with technologies and gadgets in the next 12 months. In a separate announcement during the keynote speech, Ms Fiorina said that HP would be partnering MTV to replace this year's MTV Asia music award. MTV's Asia Aid will be held in Bangkok on 3 February, and is aimed at helping to raise money for the Asian tsunami disaster. Comments are closed for this article.
Most hospital and nursing home workers ignoring calls to get vaccination Most hospital and nursing home workers ignoring calls to get vaccination Just one hospital nurse in eight has received the flu vaccine, according to a survey by the Health Protection Surveillance Centre. Photograph: Matt Kavanagh/The Online News Just one hospital nurse in eight is getting the winter flu vaccine despite repeated campaigns by the HSE to encourage greater uptake among health workers. The proportion of all health workers getting vaccinated is declining in both hospitals and long-term care facilities, according to a survey by the HSEâs Health Protection Surveillance Centre. Overall, 17.4 per cent of healthcare workers in hospitals received the jab last winter, down slightly from 18 per cent the previous winter. The survey reveals wide variations between staff groups and regionally. Dublin North-East fared best with a 27.8 per cent uptake, compared to HSE West where only 10.7 per cent of staff got vaccinated. Health and social care professionals had a 25.1 per cent uptake, compared to 12.2 per cent among nurses. In long-term facilities such as nursing homes, just 15 per cent of staff were vaccinated, down from 18 per cent the previous year. Dublin North-East had the highest rate and West was lowest, at under 10 per cent. Here, medical and dental staff had the lowest uptake, at 11.3 per cent. There was a sharp fall in the proportion of residents who were vaccinated, from 88 per cent to 73 per cent. The survey expresses concern at the absence of vaccination policies in long-term facilities, despite national recommendations. It suggests improving access to vaccination clinics, incentives and providing timely reminders as ways of raising the rate of uptake. A high uptake of the flu vaccine among healthcare workers is recognised as an important way of controlling infection and reducing the risk of transmission between staff and patients. Recent influenza outbreaks have tended to occur in setting with a low uptake among staff. Beaumont Hospital in Dublin has the highest uptake of staff, at 39 per cent, while at the hospital with the worst record, Lourdes Orthopaedic Hospital in Kilcreene, Kilkenny, just 3 per cent got the flu vaccine. None of the medical staff at this hospital got vaccinated. Last winter, over 450 people were hospitalised as a result of flu and 32 people died. Flu activity continued over three months and 72 outbreaks were recorded in residential care facilities for the elderly. The HPSC, which regards these figures as a minimum, estimates that between 200 and 500 flu-related deaths occur during most seasons. Research has pointed to a number of reason why healthcare workers are reluctant to get vaccinated, including fears about side effects, doubts about the efficacy of the vaccine and a belief that they are healthy and donât need it.

Most people who suffer heart attacks experience crucial delays in treatment because their symptoms do not appear as âHollywood-styleâ fast-onset events. Prevailing expectations and perceptions about the symptoms of heart attacks are a major factor in pre-hospital delays in treatment, a study by scientists at the school of nursing and midwifery in Trinity College Dublin found. Almost 900 patients in five hospitals were examined for the study, which looked at the type of symptoms they experience when having a heart attack and the length of time it took for them to get to hospital. The researchers found 65 per cent of patients experienced slow-onset acute coronary syndrome involving slow, milder and more intermittent symptoms. The rest experienced the classic fast-onset event characterised by sudden, intense and severe chest pain, tightness and discomfort. The type of symptoms directly influenced the time it took patients to get to an emergency department or treatment by paramedics, the study in the Journal of Emergency Medicine found. Patients with slow-onset symptoms took on average 1Â½ times longer to arrive at an emergency department than those with fast-onset symptoms. They were more likely to first phone or visit their GPs. Delays in treating a heart attack can have a significant impact on a personâs chances of survival and future health. Anyone experiencing a heart attack should receive life-saving treatment within two hours of the attack at most. The slow-onset heart attack patients in this study had an average 3Â½-hour pre-hospital delay, considerably outside the recommended optimum time for treatment, compared with two hours for the fast-onset patient group. Dr Sharon OâDonnell, director of undergraduate teaching and learning at Trinityâs nursing school, said clinicians had to be aware that most heart attacks have a slow onset and that this group of patients needed to be assessed and treated as quickly as possible.

New charges to push health insurance premiums up New charges to push health insurance premiums up Insurers claim Government plan to increase private patient fees will cost them â¬100m Dr James Reilly: decided to stick with proposed new rates for private patients treated in public hospital from the beginning of next year which would see insurers charged â¬1,000 a night for subscribers accommodated in a single room in a public teaching hospital Health insurers have warned that subscribers will face even higher increases in premiums from January on foot of a Government announcement on private patient charges late on Friday which they maintain could add close to â¬100 million to their costs. This comes on top of the reduction of tax relief on health insurance announced in the budget in October and the Governmentâs recent increase in stamp duty which insurers maintain could see the net cost of subscriptions rise by 15 per cent next year. In a letter sent on Friday evening to the health insurance industry, the Department of Health said Minister for Health James Reilly had decided to stick with proposed new rates for private patients treated in public hospital from the beginning of next year. These rates â which would see insurers charged â¬1,000 a night for subscribers accommodated in a single room in a public teaching hospital â have proven to be hugely controversial in the sector. The Minister had argued last summer that the Governmentâs intention was that the new rates would generate only â¬30 million in additional revenue next year. However insurers have disputed this projection. They maintain that a report on the proposed charges, which they commissioned from consultants Deloitte, forecast that the measures would cost them â¬115.5 million. Some insurers have argued that the new rates could realise as much as â¬130 million for the Government. In the letter, the Department of Health said it had been advised by the regulatory body for the sector, the Health Insurance Authority , that had the new rates been introduced in 2012 they would have generated an additional â¬82 million-â¬94 million in revenue. The department said that in framing the health spending estimates for 2014 it had forecast that private in-patients would use 758,000 bed days in public hospitals next year. It said that, given a fall-off in private patient activity in public hospitals compared with 2012, the proposed measures would generate additional revenue of â¬39 million. The Department of Health forecast overall that public hospitals would receive â¬560 million in respect of private patients treated in their facilities next year. Earlier this month Dr Reilly said the stamp duty for health insurance products providing âadvancedâ insurance cover would increase from â¬350 to â¬399 for an adult and from â¬120 to â¬135 a child. In the budget, the Government introduced a cap of â¬1,000 on the level of health insurance premium which attracted tax relief for adults, and â¬500 for children. Previously, tax relief of 20 per cent was available for the full cost of health insurance policies. The move saw an immediate rise in the net price paid for health insurance for people subscribing to plans costing more than â¬1,000. Subscribers to more expensive health insurance plans were hit hardest, with the net price for top-level plans increased by some 20 per cent. Last week GloHealth said it was raising the cost of plans by between 5 per cent and 10 per cent by the end of December. Aviva is expected to announce a price rise this week.

New concerns over childrenâs hospital site New concerns over childrenâs hospital site An Taisce calls for site to be moved from St Jamesâs Hospital to land near Coombe St Jamesâs Hospital in Dublin. An Taisce says the âapparent failureâ to co-locate the proposed new national childrenâs hospital with a maternity hospital, as recommended in a number of expert reports, âsends alarm bells ringingâ. Photograph: Brenda Fitzsimons An Taisce has called on the Government to move the site for the proposed new national childrenâs hospital from St Jamesâs Hospital to land beside the Coombe Hospital nearby. In a letter to Taoiseach Enda Kenny, the group warns that the Government is âsleepwalkingâ into a situation where the new hospital wonât be co-located with a maternity hospital. It says the project could fall foul of planning laws by failing to provide for co-location with a maternity hospital, leading to further delays. âUnless action is taken now, this reality will only be brought home to the wider public as the planning process unfolds â a time when it is too late to remedy the problem,â the letter from An Taisce policy director James Nix states. One year ago, the Government announced that the childrenâs hospital, the biggest capital project to be undertaken during its term in office, is to be built at St Jamesâs. The much-delayed project was originally supposed to be built at the Mater Hospital in Dublinâs north city, but this plan changed after planning permission was refused. Sick babies However, even after the hospital is built at St Jamesâs, an average of 500 very sick babies would have be transported by ambulance from maternity hospitals for treatment in the childrenâs hospital. Over 40 paediatricians from Our Ladyâs Childrenâs Hospital in Crumlin said last year it was critical to locate the new project next to a maternity hospital where such high-risk babies could be delivered. Minister for Health James Reilly says the new hospital, which the Programme for Government committed to building by 2016, will now be ready in 2018. An Taisce says the âapparent failureâ to co-locate the childrenâs hospital with a maternity hospital, as recommended in a number of expert reports, âsends alarm bells ringingâ. âTo fail to provide for maternity co-location would be to engage in project splitting. Project splitting would, in turn, fall foul of basic requirements set out in Irish and European planning law, bringing about a repeat of the previous delay all over again.â An Taisce says Mr Kenny can âsteer the project on to the right courseâ by extending the Governmentâs decision of last November to the entire Dublin Midlands hospital group which includes St Jamesâs and the Coombe and moving the project to a 15-acre site adjacent to the Coombe. It says this land, which is controlled by Nama and Dublin City Council , offers outstanding benefits for co-locating with the maternity hospital in the Coombe. The land is larger than the site available at St Jamesâs, has more access points and would allow for vital space to be preserved at St Jamesâs for the expansion of cancer facilities there, Mr Nix argues. âUnpardonableâ âIt would be unpardonable to find out in five or 10 yearsâ time that there remained insufficient space left for a maternity hospital; hence the need to right the course now, rather than run a clear risk.â The new hospital will bring together the three existing Dublin childrenâs hospitals at Crumlin, Tallaght and Temple Street. Eilish Hardiman started work as chief executive of the Childrenâs Hospital Group on Friday and work has started to decant existing activities on the site at the west end of St Jamesâs in order to make way for the new building.

Northern Irelandâs Minister for Enterprise Arlene Foster said she welcomed âpositive signsâ the local economy was improving. Photograph: Paul Faith/PA The Northern Ireland economy will grow at a faster rate than anticipated this year, up from 0.2 per cent to around 0.5 per cent, according to revised forecasts. According to the latest economic commentary from the Northâs Department of Enterprise, the local economy is showing âsigns of improvementâ, with projected growth levels of 1.8 per cent predicted for next year. Independent forecasts from London-based Oxford Economics suggest that Northern Irelandâs gross value added (GVA) â which measures productivity in the North â will be over Â£1 billion higher in 2016 than was previously anticipated. According to Oxford Economic, unemployment in Northern Ireland peaked last year and will not spike again next year as was initially predicted. The latest research shows that Northern Ireland was hit harder and for longer by the downturn than the rest of the UK. It also highlights that the outlook in Northern Ireland is currently âmore stableâ. The Northâs Minister for Enterprise Arlene Foster said she welcomed âpositive signsâ that the local economy was improving. Labour market âWhilst the Northern Ireland economy has been more severely impacted compared with elsewhere in the UK, we are now seeing encouraging trends from a range of labour market indicators, businesses now reporting increased activity, house prices potentially levelling off and positive growth in exports,â the Minister said.â Return to results
Number filing new climbs falls from six-month high Number filing new climbs falls from six-month high A job seeker talks with a recruiter at a career fair in San Francisco, California. Photograph: David Paul Morris/Online News The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits dropped from a six-month high last week, but remained elevated as California continued to deal with a backlog related to computer problems. Initial claims for state unemployment benefits fell 15,000 to a seasonally adjusted 358,000, the Labor Department said today. Economists polled by Online News had expected first-time applications to rise to 335,000 last week. A Labor Department analyst said claims in California, which has experienced technical problems during a conversion to a new computer system, remained at similar levels as in the prior week. There had not been a perceptible increase in filings last week from non-federal workers furloughed because of the just-ended government shutdown, the analyst said. The two-week partial shutdown of the federal government ended last night after the US Congress passed an 11th hour deal to temporarily fund the government through mid-January and to raise the countryâs borrowing authority until February 7th. During the week ended October 5th, the first week of the shutdown, there were 70,068 claims from furloughed federal workers. Still the underlying trend of claims remains consistent with a steady labor market. The four-week moving average for new claims, which irons out week-to-week volatility, rose 11,750 to 336,500. Last weekâs claims data covered the survey period for Octoberâs nonfarm payrolls count. But without payrolls data for September, which was delayed because of the shutdown, it is difficult to clearly check the pulse of the labour market. Apart from the spike during the week ending August 5th, new claims for jobless aid have generally pointed to fewer layoffs. The claims report showed the number of people still receiving benefits under regular state programs after an initial week of aid fell 43,000 to 2.86 million in the week ended October 5th.

Opinion: Facility needs to be located beside a maternity hospital Opinion: Facility needs to be located beside a maternity hospital It is hazardous to transport newborns in need of urgent medical care from one hospital to another. Photograph: Matt Kavanagh A year ago today, the Government announced that the new national childrenâs hospital would be built at St Jamesâs Hospital in Dublin. The news was greeted with a mixture of approval and relief; here was Irelandâs biggest and arguably best-run hospital landing the plum capital project to be built under the current Government. It seemed that at last the vision of providing top-notch care for the nationâs children in a purpose-built facility was getting back on track after the debacle surrounding the Mater site, torpedoed on planning grounds. The new hospital wonât be ready as was promised in time for the anniversary of the 1916 Rising, whose principals vowed in the Proclamation to âcherish all the children of the nation equallyâ. But things would be heading the right way. Scant progress On the surface, not much has happened in the year. Minister for Health James Reilly sent in a team of his officials to warm seats on the old board overseeing the project and it took months to set up two new boards and fill them. Itâs taken a year to appoint a chief executive and there have been delays in putting out a tender. This ground can be made up quickly if the structures work efficiently and the planning application is successful, but there is a far more fundamental question. It isnât âwhen will the hospital be built?â but âis it being built in the right place?â Weâve been here before. We built two Luas lines that didnât join up and are spending hundreds of millions making up for that mistake. Now it is planned to spend over â¬500 million building a state-of-the-art childrenâs hospital, without locating it beside a maternity hospital. Itâs the equivalent of building two light rail lines that never meet. Hereâs why. There are about 500 high-risk pregnancies in Ireland each year and, in many, the mothers involved are booked in advance into a maternity hospital. Many of the babies born require urgent medical attention in a childrenâs hospital. They might have life-threatening cardiac or respiratory conditions that require immediate paediatric intervention. As reports into the death of Savita Halappanavar reminded us, none of the Dublin maternity hospitals has an intensive-care unit or high-dependency unit. Danger to babies Currently, these newborns are transported in a hazardous fashion by ambulance to one of the childrenâs hospitals in Dublin. After the new hospital is built, they will still have to be transported by ambulance, with all the risks that involves. This is hardly âjoined-up thinkingâ. There are two ways of dealing with the problem: build a new maternity hospital beside the childrenâs hospital at St Jamesâs or move the childrenâs hospital to a site beside a maternity hospital. There is no appetite to revisit the decision to award the childrenâs hospital to St Jamesâs. There is, theoretically, space to build a maternity hospital beside the new childrenâs hospital there. However, the site is cramped and access is poor, the building cost would be high and it is doubtful whether the money can be found for many years. But rather than changing the Governmentâs decision, why not tweak it, as An Taisce has suggested, by moving the site down the road from St Jamesâs to land beside the nearby Coombe Maternity Hospital in Dublin 8? The two hospitals are closely linked and are now in the same Dublin Midlands hospital group.The two hospitals will share bosses, budgets and facilities; in effect, they will be indivisible. The Coombe site is controlled by State agencies (Nama and Dublin City Council), so it can be purchased without difficulty. Because itâs a greenfield site, planning permission presents fewer difficulties. An Taisce has claimed the hospital could be built there for â¬130 million less than at St Jamesâs. Switching to the Coombe would also free up the back end of St Jamesâs for an upgrading of cancer facilities to world-class standards. No location is ideal. For the sake of the children of Ireland and, following the Mater fiasco, for the sake of national pride, this project has to go ahead. But in the right place. .

Over half of homes valued below â¬150,000 for property tax Over half of homes valued below â¬150,000 for property tax Just 0.2 per cent of home-owners say their property worth more than â¬1 million The latest property tax statistics show 24.9 per cent of people said their property was valued at less than â¬100,000. More than half of Irelandâs homeowners have told the Revenue Commissioners their house or apartment is worth less than â¬150,000 for the purposes of the local property tax. The latest property tax statistics show 24.9 per cent of people said their property was valued at less than â¬100,000 while 28.6 per cent said their property was worth between â¬100,001 and â¬150,000. Just 0.2 per cent of the population said their property was worth more than â¬1 million. There are in excess of 25,000 claims for exemption from returned property tax assessments, with over 1,000 property owners seeking exemption due to pyrite damages. Louth and Donegal have the lowest compliance rates at 84 per cent, while DÃºn Laoghaire-Rathdown in South Co Dublin has the highest compliance rate at 92 per cent. The statistics show more than â¬200 million has been collected by the end of September, with the overall property tax compliance rate now at 90 per cent. In a further breakdown of the property tax regime, the Revenue also gave details on exemptions. Some 4.7 per cent of homes have been classed as pyrite damaged; 4.3 per cent are owned by a person who is severely incapacitated; 16.1 per cent are classed as being in ghost estates; and another 17.1 per cent are lying empty after a developer failed to get a buyer. Another 15 per cent are classed as long-term illness and 0.1 per cent are diplomatic buildings. Most people who have paid the tax have used a credit or debit card while almost one third paid by cheque, or an equivalent.

An Irish-born, US-based yeast boffin who likes nothing more than distilling a drop of the craythur, Lyons told me he is buying a church in which to make his whiskey. Do you think they will call it The Holy Spirit? Tale of two stills Lyons bought two stills last year and sent them to Ireland before he had given a thought about where to house them. They have been effectively kipping on the couch of The Carlow Brewing Company ever since. Lyons revealed, however, he has agreed to buy St James Church near the Guinness Storehouse, where he now hopes to house them. The property deal is subject to due diligence and the whole proposal is subject to planning. When does he think it will happen? âWhenever they let me,â he said.

Players sought for $1m prize Players sought for $1m prize UK gamers are getting a chance to take part in a $1m tournament thanks to one of the country's top teams. The Four-Kings clan is staging a Pop Idol type competition to find new members who can take on the world's best in the lucrative tournament. Four-Kings hopes the open qualifiers will turn up gamers good enough to beat all comers at the Painkiller game. Top players also get a contract with the Four-Kings team which will pay travelling expenses for the contest. UK gamers have until 12 November to register their interest in taking part and can sign up via the Four-Kings, Jolt.co.uk and Painkiller tournament websites. Philip Wride, who co-manages the Four-Kings team, said online qualifiers will be held from 16-28 November to find the best eight players of the Painkiller game. He said the clan was running the contest because Four-Kings does not currently have any players that excel at Painkiller. These eight players will be brought together in London on 3-5 December for the Bloodline Tournament that will find the best two players. The event will be filmed and the final cut made available online for others to watch. The movie is being put together by Simon Bysshe who has shot many other films about pro-gaming that have been widely shared online. Said Mr Bysshe: "Painkiller is a new game and the opportunity is there for a new player to step up." Painkiller has been described as a game that adds a few modern touches, such as improved graphics, to the old-fashioned first-person shooter. These two players will be put forward as the UK's entrants to the Cyberathlete Professional League $1m Painkiller contest that will take place throughout 2005. The event is being billed as the CPL World Tour and will be arranged around ten separate tournaments at different locations around the world. Travel expenses to all the stops on the tour will be paid by Four-Kings for the two UK players who make the grade. The top prize at each stop on the world tour will be $15,000. A further $150,000 will be given to the winner of the Grand Final due to be held in December 2005. Mr Wride said any gamer that wins a few tour stop tournaments and the grand final will have a very good year. The first stop on the world tour will be Istanbul, Turkey from 10-13 February. A total of $50,000 in cash prizes is on offer. The CPL has said that it picked a one-on-one game such as Painkiller to make it easier for spectators to follow the action. Counter-Strike, by far the most popular online game, pits teams against each other and can be confusing to follow if those watching are not familiar with the layout of the maps on which it is played. The decision to pick Painkiller was greeted with surprise by many gamers, as it was widely expected that Doom 3 would be chosen as the one-one-one title. Comments are closed for this article.
Post-election negotiations are not expected to finish before December Post-election negotiations are not expected to finish before December German chancellor Angela Merkel with colleagues in Berlin yesterday. Photograph: Tobias Schwarz/Online News Seven weeks after Germanyâs federal election, Berlinâs government quarter resembles the land that time forgot. When the German people spoke, they left Angela Merkelâs Christian Democratic Union (CDU) just short of an absolute majority. She is still talking with her ostensible rivals in the Social Democratic Party (SPD) about forming a second grand coalition. The negotiations are likely to continue until the end of the month. After that SPD leaders have promised to put any final deal to rank-and-file members in a postal vote. A result is not likely until mid-December. For the rest of Europe , that means no real progress likely until next year on pressing EU projects, such as outstanding details of banking union. At this rate Ireland is likely to have exited its EU/IMF programme long before any meaningful talks on outstanding bailout business occur â in particular what happens with its nationalised bank debt. âThereâll be no agreement on any of that before the new government is sworn in,â said one CDU negotiator yesterday. Things are progressing so slowly and smoothly that the news-parched Spiegel Online website pleaded with the prospective coalition partners yesterday: âPlease just have a row!â While politicians elsewhere in Europe grapple with crisis- driven political problems, German political priorities are in a parallel universe. For instance the biggest concern of the Christian Social Union (CSU), Dr Merkelâs Bavarian allies, is a toll for foreign motorists on German motorways. With Bavarian roads a popular corridor for western Europe traffic to the Alps and Italy , this vote-winning promise helped the CSU to secure an absolute majority in Septemberâs state election there. Failing to deliver will cost the CSU dear, but neither the SPD nor CDU are enthused. The most likely way to implement the levy, and stay within European law, is to toll all motorists who use the autobahns and then give German drivers a rebate on the motor tax. The trouble with this model is that the bigger your car â and thus your road tax â the more you are likely to save on a write-off, sending a dubious environmental signal. Another problem is that the only feasibility studies, all favouring the project, were written by the company likely to collect the toll. Womenâs pensions While the CSU frets over tolls, CDU leader Merkel toils over her pension promises. On the campaign trail, she vowed to end a situation where older women who raised children, and missed out on making retirement payments, now have lower pension entitlements than younger women. The CDU insist it is a matter of social justice, but critics suggest the promise was a way to buy votes. More than half of over-70 German women, those set to benefit from the reform, voted for the CDU. Now Dr Merkel has to deliver on a promise with an estimated annual cost of â¬6.5 billion, half of what Germanyâs education and research ministry spends in a year. The SPD, standing firm on its demand for an â¬8.50 statutory minimum wage, has pension demands of its own. It wants to see workers who have worked 45 years retire as early as 63 years of age without losing pension payments. Add up all these pension promises and you top â¬20 billion annually in a country where the demographic timebomb is ticking. Some coalition agreement has been reached so far: a limit on rent increases in urban areas; a law to close Germanyâs 20 per cent gender pay gap; lower subsidies for renewable energy and slower progress building off-shore wind parks. But the messy work, such as divvying up cabinet posts, lies ahead, as does the financing of their political largesse: the SPD wants tax cuts for top earners; the CDU/CSU disagree. Yesterday one CSU negotiator said ominously: âNothingâs agreed until everythingâs agreed.â The longer talks drag on, the less attractive the idea of a grand coalition is to German voters. Almost 60 per cent liked the idea on election night, now just 44 per cent approve; a third of voters are turned off, up from a quarter in the same period. And all the while, Germanyâs talks inch forward. Return to results
Praveen Halappanavar highlights lack of independent role in disciplinary process Praveen Halappanavar highlights lack of independent role in disciplinary process Praveen Halappanavar says there should be an external component to the review. Photograph: Brenda Fitzsimons Savita Halappanavarâs husband, Praveen, has criticised the lack of outside independent involvement in the disciplinary process announced for staff involved in her care. The actions of all staff members in University Hospital Galway who were involved in Ms Halappanavarâs care are to be reviewed taking account of the coronerâs inquest and the Health Service Executive (HSE) and Health Information and Quality Authority (Hiqa) investigations into her death last October. Appropriate action would be taken in the light of these proceedings, Bill Maher, chief executive of the West/North West Hospital group, said yesterday in a statement released after a five-hour meeting of the group board on Thursday evening. âI believe that in many instances there will be no case to answer. As part of the disciplinary process, if we believe it appropriate we will refer individuals to the Irish Medical Council and the Nursing and Midwifery Board.â However, Gerard OâDonnell, solicitor for Mr Halappanavar, said last night his client believed there should be an external, independent component to the disciplinary process, which is to be led by Mr Maher. Accountability He said he welcomed the fact that the HSE was moving towards âsome element of accountabilityâ and he recognised the people were entitled to due process. Mr Maherâs statement revealed that the Medical Council and the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland have âalready advanced to preliminary hearings in some instancesâ. He promised full co-operation with the two regulatory bodies and promised to refer the inquest transcripts and findings, and the HSE and Hiqa reports, to them âto help restore public confidenceâ. However, Mr OâDonnell said it was news to him that the regulatory bodies were already holding preliminary hearings and he would be writing to them to ascertain the nature of these proceedings. The Medical Council said that as a matter of policy it never confirms whether it had received or was investigating individual complaints. Details of complaints were made available to the public only if an inquiry was held in public. Last weekâs Hiqa report into Ms Halappanavarâs death, after she was admitted to University Hospital Galway while 17 weeks pregnant and miscarrying, identified 13 âmissed opportunitiesâ which, had they been identified and acted upon by the hospital, âmay potentially have resulted in a different outcome for herâ. Mr Maher said considerable progress had been made in implementing the recommendations from the HSE investigation and the inquest. These include the implementation of early-warning scoring systems; the education of all staff in the recognition, monitoring and management of sepsis and septic shock; the introduction of a new, multidisciplinary team- based training programme in the management of obstetric emergencies, including sepsis; the completion of specialist bereavement counselling training for key staff in the maternity unit; and improved communications procedures for doctorsâ handovers. He said these recommendations were being implemented in all hospitals across the group and not just in UHG. Return to results
QPR keeper Day heads for Preston QPR keeper Day heads for Preston Queens Park Rangers keeper Chris Day is set to join Preston on a month's loan. Day has been displaced by the arrival of Simon Royce, who is in his second month on loan from Charlton. QPR have also signed Italian Generoso Rossi. R's manager Ian Holloway said: "Some might say it's a risk as he can't be recalled during that month and Simon Royce can now be recalled by Charlton. "But I have other irons in the fire. I have had a 'yes' from a couple of others should I need them." Day's Rangers contract expires in the summer. Meanwhile, Holloway is hoping to complete the signing of Middlesbrough defender Andy Davies - either permanently or again on loan - before Saturday's match at Ipswich. Davies impressed during a recent loan spell at Loftus Road. Holloway is also chasing Bristol City midfielder Tom Doherty. Return to results
Rangers seal Old Firm win Rangers seal Old Firm win Goals from Gregory Vignal and Nacho Novo gave Rangers a scrappy victory at Celtic Park that moves them three points clear of the champions. Rangers had rarely threatened until Celtic goalkeeper Rab Douglas let defender Vignal's 25-yard drive slip through his grasp and into the net. Opposite number Ronald Waterreus had been Rangers' hero, saving superbly from Craig Bellamy and John Hartson. Striker Novo secured victory, lobbing Douglas with eight minutes remaining. It ended Celtic's 11-game unbeaten run at home in Old Firm derbies and gave Rangers manager Alex McLeish his first victory at the home of his Glasgow rivals. Celtic had won their last six meetings on their home pitch, including twice already this season. They started confidently, with new signing Bellamy, on loan from Newcastle United, given his Celtic debut up front with Wales international colleague John Hartson and Chris Sutton dropping into midfield. It took Bellamy just four minutes to threaten, taking on Marvin Andrews before delivering a low drive that was held by Waterreus at the second attempt. He had an even better chance after Hartson dispossesed Sotiris Kyrgiakos and sent his strike partner clear with only the goalkeeper to beat. But Waterreus did well to beat away Bellamy's disappointing low drive from 16 yards. Waterreus came to the rescue again when the ball fell to Hartson just inside the box and the Dutch goalkeeper made a brave block. It was an Old Firm return for Barry Ferguson as McLeish stuck by the side that thumped four goals past Hibernian. But Rangers found Celtic harder to break down and Douglas was not threatened until 10 minutes after the break. Dado Prso turned inside Neil Lennon only for the Celtic goalkeeper to beat away his powerful 18-yard drive. A great defensive header by Andrews prevented Hartson pouncing from five yards out. Hartson foxed Vignal at the edge of the Rangers box, but the striker's shot on the turn was again beaten away by Waterreus. Rangers were beginning to dominate the midfield and Vignal, collecting a knock back from Fernando Ricksen, broke the deadlock, Douglas somehow letting the Frenchman's dipping drive slip through his grasp. Novo pounced on a moments' hesitation in the Celtic defence to latch on to a long ball from Ricksen and lob the ball over the advancing Douglas. Ricksen appeared to be hit by a coin, but it could not prevent Rangers' celebrations at the final whistle. : Douglas, McNamara, Balde, Varga, Laursen, Petrov, Lennon, Sutton, Thompson, Bellamy, Hartson.

Researchers hail âturning pointâ in Alzheimerâs treatment Researchers hail âturning pointâ in Alzheimerâs treatment New approach focused on root cause of brain diseases has positive effect on mice It could be a decade before the research leads to a pill that could be taken by people with Alzheimerâs disease. A new British study has raised the prospect of a pill that can treat brain diseases such as Alzheimerâs by halting the death of neurons. The research, performed on sick mice, is at a very early stage and it could be a decade or more before any medicine suitable for patients is developed. But experts say the findings are highly significant, and one predicted that they would be judged by future generations as an historic turning point. The Medical Research Council (MRC) team focused on the root cause of many degenerative brain diseases, including Alzheimerâs and Parkinsonâs â abnormally shaped proteins that stick together in clumps and fibres. When enough misshapen protein builds up in the brain it can trigger a reaction that results in the death of nerve cells. Other approaches have sought to stop or limit the accumulation of the abnormal protein, whose structure is folded the wrong way. Instead, the MRC researchers targeted the harmful way brain cells react to misfolded proteins. Using a drug injected into the stomachs of mice through a mouth tube, they flipped a cellular switch from âoffâ to âonâ to prevent neurons dying. Five weeks after treatment one group of mice remained free of symptoms such as memory loss, impaired reflexes and limb dragging. They also lived longer than untreated animals with the same brain disease. The scientists stress human trials are a long way off and point out that the mice suffered serious side effects, including significant weight loss and raised blood sugar. But they also believe the research demonstrates in principle the possibility of developing an oral treatment â a pill or swallowed liquid â that can protect the brain from neurodegenerative disease. The research, reported in the journal Science Translational Medicine, duplicated previous results achieved by the same team by means of genetic engineering. As in the earlier study, a neurodegenerative disease caused by abnormal prion proteins was induced in the mice. Prion diseases, which include Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD), are rare in humans but share the same underlying cause â misfolded proteins â as more common conditions such as Alzeimerâs. Lead scientist Professor Giovanna Mallucci , from the MRC Toxicology Unit at the University of Leicester, said: âOur previous study predicted that this pathway could be a target for treatment to protect brain cells in neurodegenerative disease. So we administered a compound that blocks it to mice with prion disease. We were extremely excited when we saw the treatment stop the disease in its tracks and protect brain cells, restoring some normal behaviours and preventing memory loss in the mice. âWeâre still a long way from a usable drug for humans â this compound had serious side effects. But the fact that we have established that this pathway can be manipulated to protect against brain cell loss, first with genetic tools and now with a compound, means that developing drug treatments targeting this pathway for prion and other neurodegenerative diseases is now a real possibility.â The experimental drug, known as GSK2606414, is made by pharmaceutical giants GlaxoSmithKline. It targets an enzyme called PERK which plays a key role in the response of neurons to the build-up of misfolded proteins in the brain. As part of a natural defence mechanism, the neurons react by switching off their production of new proteins. Ultimately, this leads to their death. By blocking PERK, the new drug stops this happening, thereby allowing the cells to survive. A key property of the compound is its ability to penetrate the âblood brain barrierâ â a natural shield that prevents toxic substances entering the brain, but also acts as a major obstacle to drug treatments. Commenting on the research, Professor Roger Morris , from the Department of Chemistry at Kingâs College London, said: âThis is the first convincing report that a small drug, of the type most conveniently turned into medicines, stops the progressive death of neurons in the brain as found, for instance, in Alzheimerâs disease. âTrue, this study has been done in mice, not man; and it is prion disease, not Alzheimerâs, that has been cured. However, there is considerable evidence that the way neurons die in both diseases is similar; and lessons learned in mice from prion disease have proved accurate guides to attenuate the progress of Alzheimerâs disease in patients.â - PA
Ronaldinho denies Blues interest Ronaldinho denies Blues interest Fifa World Player of the Year Ronaldinho says he has no intention of leaving Barcelona to join Chelsea. "I never said I wanted to play for Chelsea. I'm very happy where I am and want to carry on where I am," he said. "I want to be part of the history of Barcelona as a winning player. Barcelona has given more to me than I have to them." The Brazilian added: "From the first day I have had lovely surprises. Barcelona, for me, is perfect." Ronaldinho's words will reassure Barca after the Brazilian previously said he was interested in moving to England. He was quoted as saying: "What Chelsea are doing is absolutely amazing. I respect them a lot and can see maybe see myself living in London one day." Barca meet Chelsea in the last 16 of the Champions League and Ronaldinho is expecting a tough time against the London outfit. "I hope we can reach the final of the Champions League, but it is a very strong competition," he said. "Chelsea are one of the highest-ranking teams." Comments are closed for this article.
Sanchez targets NI win in Warsaw Sanchez targets NI win in Warsaw Northern Ireland manager Lawrie Sanchez has targeted the 30 March game in Poland as their most important in the World Cup qualifying campaign. While fans are savouring the prospect of playing England at Old Trafford four days earlier, Sanchez knows the Polish clash holds the key to second place. "If we do not beat Poland the group will be almost dead. They will be pretty sure of second," said Sanchez. "I would like to beat England but the Poland game is most important." Sanchez's side are currently fourth in Group Six with three points while the Poles are second with nine. So, with four games left, Northern Ireland need to make up ground in Warsaw. "I do not think qualifying for this World Cup is closed yet but we have to beat Poland to keep it open," said Sanchez. "If we do not make it this time, then there is the European Championship. I want us to get closer and closer to qualifying. "I want to get Northern Ireland back in the finals of a major competition and I also aim to get into the top 100 of the Fifa rankings. We are well capable of that." Before the World Cup qualifiers, Canada visit Belfast for a 9 February friendly and Sanchez will be giving some fringe players the opportunity to catch his eye. "We have one or two injuries and suspensions at the moment," added Sanchez. "Stuart Elliott is injured and Michael Hughes and James Quinn are suspended for the England game so it gives me the chance to have a look at other players who might come into the equation. "It will be nice to get back to Belfast for a home game and it is about time we put an end to our run without a home win." Northern Ireland have not won at home under Sanchez. Indeed, their last Windsor success was back in September 2001 when they beat Iceland in the last World Cup campaign. Comments are closed for this article.
Scaling the popularity stakes Scaling the popularity stakes Climbing, in all its forms, has gone from being a tiny niche activity to being one of the countryâs fastest-growing sports with thousands of participants Lucy Mitchell competing at the ODON Irish Lead Climbing Championship at Awesome Walls, Dublin on her way to becoming Senior Female Champion.

Photograph: John Banyard Previous Image Next Image Previous Images More Images Harry McGee Up until about a handful of years ago, says Damien OâSullivan, you might have got 50 or 60 people out climbing in Dublin on a weekend day, and perhaps as many more around the country. Nowadays, you will often get 500 or more. Theyâre either rock climbing in Dalkey or Glendalough or Fair Head in Co Antrim or Alladie in Co Clare; or bouldering in a myriad of sites around Co Wicklow; or using the growing number of indoor climbing and bouldering walls â of which the impressive Gravity in Inchicore and the tremendous Awesome Walls in Finglas are the latest and shiniest additions. Fastest-growing sports Vertical climbing has gone from being a tiny niche activity (with a small cohort of enthusiasts) to being one of the countryâs fastest-growing sports with thousands of participants. OâSullivan, the talent development officer of Mountaineering Ireland , is a climber himself and has witnessed its burgeoning popularity at first hand. It might not yet be the second most popular sporting activity, as it is in Austria, nor a national sport, as it in France, but Ireland has some of the best cliff-faces and crags for rock-climbing in the world, including the extraordinary and difficult cliffs of Fair Head. âI suppose the increase in popularity is a combination of a bunch of things. There has been a move towards more outdoor sports and less team sports. New facilities have been built like Awesome, Gravity and Play at Height [in Dingle]. Bouldering is becoming more popular. There is better gear, there are better mats and more opportunities,â says OâSullivan. Bouldering is more technical climbing that is done without a rope and usually involves a âproblemâ that can be overcome in a few moves. The routes donât go very high and protection from a fall is provided by a thick mat. Indoor and sports climbing involves using a rope, harness and tight-fitting rock shoes with pointed rubber soles. The climber clips the rope into bolted carabiners dotting the upward route during ascent. In outdoor traditional climbing, there are no bolts â climbers place nuts or injection-like camming devices into cracks and fissures in the rock as they progress upwards. OâSullivan says the attractions of the sport are many. âIt is a gender-neutral sport. It does not matter what age you are or what body type you have.â Brightest talents The proof of that was the ODON Irish Lead Climbing Championship held in Awesome Walls recently. One of the brightest talents is 16-year old Dominic Burns from Rosetta in Belfast who is ranked number one in the world for bouldering in his age group (a massive achievement considering that millions climb across the world). He came second in the senior competition to another amazing climber, Alex Waterhouse . .

Seamen sail into biometric future Seamen sail into biometric future The luxury cruise liner Crystal Harmony, currently in the Gulf of Mexico, is the unlikely setting for tests of biometric technology. As holidaymakers enjoy balmy breezes, their ship's crew is testing prototype versions of the world's first internationally issued biometric ID cards, the seafarer's equivalent of a passport. Along with the owner's picture, name and personal details, the new Seafarers' Identity Document incorporates a barcode representing unique features of its holder's fingerprints. The cards are due to be issued in February next year, in line with the revised UN Convention on Seafarers' Identity Documents of June 2003. Tests currently under way in the Caribbean are designed to ensure that new cards and their machine readers, produced by different companies in different countries, are working to interoperable standards. Results of the current tests, which involve seafarers from a wide range of occupations and nationalities, will be published by the International Labour Organisation (ILO) by the end of November. Crystal Cruises, which operates the Crystal Harmony, is exploring the use of biometrics but has not yet committed to the technology. Authenti-corp, the US technology consultancy, has been working with the ILO on its technical specifications for the cards. "If you're issued a seafarer's ID in your country, you want to be sure that when the ship lands in a port in, say, my country you can validate yourself using whatever equipment we have installed," Authenti-corp's CEO, Cynthia Musselman, told the Online News's Go Digital programme. She said French, Jordanian and Nigerian nationals would be the first seafarers to get the new ID cards since their countries have already ratified the convention. It aims to combat international terrorism whilst guaranteeing the welfare the one million seafarers estimated to be at sea. The convention highlights the importance of access to shore facilities and shore leave as vital elements to a sailor's wellbeing and, therefore, it says, to safer shipping and cleaner oceans. "By increasing security on the seas as well as border control and protection, the cards will hopefully reduce the number of piracy problems around the world," said Ms Musselman. "It should be a safer environment for seafarers to work in, and will allow people protecting their borders to have confidence that the people getting off the ship are, in fact, seafarers."

Small Firms Association calls for creation of bank for entrepreneurs Small Firms Association calls for creation of bank for entrepreneurs Access to credit a concern after departures of Danske and ACC, says chairman AJ Noonan Danske, which has 100,000 personal and 10,000 business customers, was the second bank in a week to announce plans to close. Photograph: Eric Luke/The Online News The decision of lenders such as Danske Bank to pull the plug on their Irish operations will put further pressure on small businesses when it comes to accessing credit, Small Firms Association chairman AJ Noonan has warned. Danske, which has 100,000 personal and 10,000 business customers, was the second bank in a week to announce plans to close after ACCBank had last weekend said it was handing back its banking licence and closing its remaining branches in Ireland. Calling for the Government to establish a State bank to help small firms, Mr Noonan said one in four firms is still finding it challenging to access credit. He questioned whether the troikaâs departure would lead to âparity of esteemâ for entrepreneurs and small business in accessing finance and credit. âWe now need to see the banks lending to more challenging but viable businesses to ensure they can access the credit they require for working capital and investment.â Troika departure Mr Noonan said it was âimperativeâ the Government spell out exactly what the departure of the troika and regaining of our economic sovereignty means. âWill it mean that our pension contributions will be safe from further levies and taxes?â He added that AIB and Bank of Ireland claim they are lending, promoting âhuge grant approval ratesâ. âThere are low drawdown rates though. The price of the loan is too high for the small firm to meet, or they would find it too hard to meet the terms and conditions. They thus donât draw down the loan.â He said the banks should re-examine their lending policies and why so many loans are approved but not drawn down. Separately yesterday, Permanent TSB said it would increase the number of products and services it offers to banking customers in Ireland, following the moves by Danske and ACC. PTSB said it intended to bring forward the introduction of a number of initiatives, including the provision of increased resources for small businesses. Addressing the Small Firms Association annual lunch yesterday, Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport Leo Varadkar said raising the credit review threshold and improvements to the R&D tax credit in the budget were good things for small businesses but not enough. âBusinesses need more customers and more domestic demand. There is the possibility of further stimulus in a few months using the proceeds from the sale of Bord GÃ¡is and the power plants.â He said Ireland has âvery high marginal tax ratesâ which was affecting the retail market. âIf we could provide a middle income tax cut in the next budget or the one after, that would stimulate domestic demand.â Comments are closed for this article.
Smartphones suffer Skulls attack Smartphones suffer Skulls attack Owners of some Nokia smartphones are being warned to watch out for malicious wallpaper. Those downloading the software could find all the icons on their 7610 phone swapped for images of skulls. When installed the malicious program also locks many of the 7610's functions making it hard to use and harder to repair. The program is only the latest in a series of viruses produced to attack mobile phones. The file, nicknamed Skulls, is thought to have surfaced on shareware sites where people can pick up free add-ons, such as wallpaper, games and ringtones, for their phones Symbian said that it was not sure if the damage Skulls does was intentional or simply a result of bad programming. Soon after being discovered the file is thought to have been removed from the sites that were unwittingly harbouring it. The program is masquerading as software that creates new background images and themes for the main screen of the 7610 phone. The Skulls program is labelled as a file called: 7610.extended.theme.manager.zip. Once installed the program replaces all the icons on the main page with skulls and replaces all the working applications, such as contacts, calendar, notebook etc with non-working versions so the phone becomes almost useless. The only thing the phone can do is make and take calls. A statement by Symbian played down the significance of the malicious program and said few people would fall victim to it as users have to go through several steps to install it, one of which includes ignoring a security warning. Symbian said that the spread of the Skulls program was likely to be limited as the program cannot travel from one phone to another by itself. Despite this Finnish anti-virus lab F-Secure said it had sporadic reports of 7610 owners being caught out by it. The firm has produced guidance for users caught out to help them remove the program and get their phone working again. The Skulls program is thought to have been written by a malicious hacker using the alias Tee-222. Symbian phones produced by Sony Ericsson, Motorola, BenQ, Arima and Fujitsu are unaffected by the Skulls program. Return to results
Souness delight at Euro progress Souness delight at Euro progress Boss Graeme Souness felt Newcastle were never really in danger of going out of the Uefa Cup against Heerenveen. An early own goal followed by an Alan Shearer strike earned them a 2-1 win and a place in the Uefa Cup last 16. "Obviously with winning in the first leg it gave us a great advantage," he said after the 4-2 aggregate victory. "We got our goals early and in the minds of some players the job was done but then they got a goal and perhaps made us a bit nervous." Shearer's goal moved him within 12 of Jackie Milburn's club scoring record of 200 for the Magpies. But Souness said he did not think beating the record would have any bearing on his decision to retire at the end of the season. "I think if he got it this year he would want to stay next year anyway," he added. "He struck the ball very well - he always has done - and I think it was the power and pace that beat the goalkeeper." Souness also paid tribute to Laurent Robert, who was at the heart of much of United's attacking play. "In the first half he did really well and did everything you want from a wide player. More of the same in future please," he said. Comments are closed for this article.
Survival time for common cancers shorter in Ireland compared to European average Survival time for common cancers shorter in Ireland compared to European average Bulgaria, Slovakia and Poland had some of the poorest survival rates for certain cancers People in the Republic diagnosed with some common cancers have a shorter survival time compared with the European average, research published this morning has found. The five-year survival following diagnosis for cancer of the colon is 52 per cent compared with a 57 per cent average across 29 European countries, the latest Eurocare report shows. Survival times for cancers of the kidney and ovary are also shorter for people living in the UK and Ireland . However survival for other cancers such as tumours in the rectum, prostate and breast as well as melanoma skin cancers are higher than the European average. The results, published today in the medical journal Lancet Oncology are based on data from national cancer registries. Researchers compared five-year survival from diagnosis for more than 9 million adults and over 60,000 children diagnosed with cancer between 2000 and 2007. Eastern European countries such as Bulgaria , Slovakia and Poland had some of the poorest survival rates for certain cancers usually associated with a good prognosis. But the gulf in survival between east and west is closing, with evidence that some eastern European countries with previously poorer survival are catching up. However an accompanying editorial warns that more detailed information is required to allow for a better interpretation of Eurocare data. âRegistries should record more sociodemographic information and more details about investigation, staging, treatment, recurrences, and second-line treatment,â it says. The study authors acknowledge that interpreting cancer survival differences is complex. âLonger survival may be due to better treatments or to earlier diagnosis that improves the efficacy of existing treatments. However other factors such as tumour biology, lifestyle, presence of other concomitant diseases . . . can directly or indirectly influence survival,â they note. Director of the National Cancer Control Programme, Dr Susan OâReilly said cancer diagnosis and treatment in Ireland had undergone major changes in recent decades, most notably with the introduction of the National Cancer Control Programme in 2007. As a result, she said, she would expect to see favourable changes in cancer survival rates over the coming five to 10 years. Return to results
Taoiseach stresses need to reduce deficit in address to business leaders Taoiseach stresses need to reduce deficit in address to business leaders Kenny says Governmentâs main objective is to fix public finances Dan Doctoroff, ceo and president of Online News, at the Convention Centre, Dublin where he addressed the Dublin Chamber of Commerce Annual Dinner, with Bernard Byrne of AIB, Liam Kavanagh, president of the Dublin Chamber of Commerce, and Gina Quinn, CEO of the Dublin Chamber of Commerce. Photograph: Brenda Fitzsimons Charlie Taylor Restoring Irelandâs reputation for prudent financial management is key to getting more investment and jobs into the country, Taoiseach Enda Kenny has said. Addressing more than 1,600 business leaders at the annual Dublin Chamber of Commerce dinner in the Convention Centre last night, Mr Kenny also said that while agreement has been reached to ensure that spending cuts and tax increases will be less than previously forecast, next weekâs Budget will still be difficult for many. Mr Kenny said the Governmentâs main objectives in the Budget is to continue the job of fixing the public finances in order to exit the bailout later this year and to invest in the creation of jobs. The Taoiseach said the Government remains committed to reducing the deficit to below 5 per cent next year and below 3 per cent by 2015. âThe gap between day-to- day Government spending and tax receipts is still one of the highest in the euro zone. It is also unsustainable,â he said. Mr Kenny used his speech to highlight the role that Dublin plays in driving the national economy. Claiming that the cityâs best days are still to come, he said much work has been done in recent years to transform the capital from âan underdeveloped resource to a modern, cosmopolitan and creative cityâ. âDublin has become a true international city. And as such Dublin is now competing for investment and jobs with competitor cities all over the world,â he said. The greatest way to commemorate Dublin in 1916 will be for our capital city, 100 years on in 2016, to be a vibrant, attractive, and successful city.â The chief executive and president of Online News Dan Doctoroff said Irelandâs decision to make difficult decisions and keep investing during recessionary times will help it to recover. Mr Doctoroff, who also served as deputy mayor for economic development and rebuilding of New York following the September 11th attacks in 2001, said constant investment, radical self-awareness and the ability to think big are key skills needed to rebuild economies. Praising the decisions taken over the past five years to bolster the economy, he said Ireland would emerge stronger than before. âThe challenge of thinking big is that it doesnât always show up in the next quarterly GDP report,â he said. âIn Ireland your determination to keep investing in the things that really matter has allowed you to become a place where Irish entrepreneurs are building and creating jobs and taking ideas to the world.â âBad tasteâ Director of personal, business and corporate banking at AIB Bernard Byrne told business leaders the excesses of the past, both within the banking industry and further afield, had âleft us with a bad taste and a strong desire for the opposite regime to prevail.â He added that the banking system was close to being back on track. âWhile the work is not completed, the significant restructuring of the industry that has seen â¬70 billion of loans delivered across the industry and massive shrinkage of headcount are more in the past than a future prospect,â he said. âThe signs of the return to profitability are strong and 2013 will prove to have been the watershed year where the debate about credit provisions is finally laid to rest with the pillar banks seeing 2014 as the year when profits exceed provisions for the first time. We are within touching distance of the self-financing viable banks that are so badly needed.â Grounds for optimism President of Dublin Chamber of Commerce Liam Kavanagh said there were grounds for optimism about the economy but that more needed to be done to get the country back on track. Calling for the retention of the 9 per cent Vat rate, he also stressed the need to retain the current corporation tax rate to attract foreign investment. Mr Kavanagh also stressed the need for a directly elected mayor for the capital. âDublin needs its own âpolitical championâ. The Chamber believes that Dublin should have a directly elected Mayor. But that office must have real executive power and authority to drive the promotion of enterprise, innovation, tourism and transport for the city,â he said. Return to results

Tapping-up row is so much hot air Tapping-up row is so much hot air The big talking point of the week is the issue of making illegal approaches or 'tapping up' a player. As usual, the issue is probably blown out of proportion, but I don't think anyone in football will deny there is a problem with the rules as they apply to recruiting players. I read somewhere at the weekend that they did a straw poll and questioned every player at a particular club as to how he got there. Just about every one said the first approach was through their agent, or a third party or somebody involved with the club. On that basis, under the rules as they stand, they all got there illegally. That's the name of the game these days, I'm afraid. Not that I have ever tapped a player up - I wouldn't dream of it! I know there is a school of thought that says the rules that apply in football just wouldn't be tolerated in the outside business world. In business, if you want to change jobs, you can simply go and have a chat with another prospective employer. But in football you're not allowed to do that. Football does have strange anomalies. For example, the game has a disciplinary procedure where there is no evidence but you can still find yourself in trouble. It's the sort of thing that wouldn't happen in a court of law. Compared to the outside world, football does have some very restrictive practices, and a lot of them have to be looked at, but if you want to be part of it, you have to adhere to the rules. You try and do things the right way, but it's like buying a house. If you do things properly and play by the rules you'll find yourself gazumped. But I don't think the tapping situation is as bad as people say, a lot of it is hot air. By its very nature, the only people who would be approached are the top players who are in demand anyway. I don't think you would find too many approaches being made to bad players. The Championship is building up to an exciting climax, and in beating us 2-0 last week, Ipswich gave signs of what a good team they are. I think a place in the top two is beyond our reach, but any one of 11 teams could make the play-offs and there are still 15 games to go. Of course the play-offs are exciting for fans, but they're not great for the heart-rates of managers. I think I've been involved in five play-off finals now and they should really come with a government health warning. Ideally, you wouldn't want to be involved in the play-offs, and the way to do that is to finish in the top two, but I think that is beyond us now. We've got a decent run-in, we're still trying to strengthen the squad and by the time the next league game comes round I would hope we've got somebody in. But that brings me on to another matter, and the fact that the next game is more than a week away because of international matches. You're always concerned about your players getting injured and some clubs withdraw their players more than others. I always try and let our players go out for international games - it keeps them happy. But the other thorny issue with internationals is that of wages. I think that while players are on international duty, their wages should be paid by their countries. Sometimes, they can be away for a week or more, but the clubs still have to find their wages, even though the player is denied to them for that period of time. Of course, if a player is injured while on international duty, it's the clubs who have to pay his wages while he's out of action and recovering. I think the associations of the country involved should bear some share of the responsibility. Return to results
The future in your pocket The future in your pocket If you are a geek or gadget fan, the next 12 months look like they are going to be a lot of fun. The relentless pace of development in the hi-tech world and rampant competition in many of its sectors, particularly among mobile phone firms, all suggests that 2005 is going to be a very good year. To begin with, 2005 will be the year that third-generation (3G) mobile phones become inescapable. The 3 network launched in 2003, Vodafone launched its consumer service in November, Orange followed in early December and T-Mobile and O2 are due to launch in 2005. The main result of these launches will likely be a slew of good deals for consumers as operators try to poach new customers from rivals and convince existing users to trade up. Already the extra capacity in 3G networks lets 3 offer good deals on voice calls at rates that will probably have to be matched by the other operators. But the shift in technology and low cost of voice calls means that operators lose a significant chunk of their revenue. "Show me an operator that believes their voice business can sustain them, and I'll write their obituary" said Niel Ransom, chief technology officer at Alcatel. Instead operators are likely to push all other things that 3G phones can do such as video messaging and other multimedia capabilities. Already camera phones look set to challenge digital cameras and are likely to win more fans as multi-megapixel devices go on sale. But 3G will not have everything its own way. It will face competition from emerging technologies such as Wimax. This wireless technology can boost data transmission speeds up to 75 megabits per second and works over distances of up to 30 miles. Kent is likely to be the site of the UK's first Wimax network which is due to go live in 2005 and it could be the way that rural areas get high-speed net access. Analyst firm Telecom View predicts that Wimax will steal a lot of market share from 3G and will be a clear winner. Bob Larribeau, principal analyst at Telecom View, said the better return on investment offered by technologies such as Wimax could dent the possible returns of 3G networks. And the growing ubiquity of wi-fi must not be forgotten either. The technology is popping up in more places than ever and its wider use is only held back by the price differences across countries and suppliers. Moves to unite mobile and fixed phones look set to get more emphasis in 2005 too. For a start, BT looks set to roll out its Bluephone project during the next 12 months. The service revolves around a hybrid device that uses the mobile networks when you are out and about but switches back to the fixed line when you are at home. Fixed line phones will also start to get much more serious competition from a technology that has the formidable name of Voice over IP (Voip). Voip routes calls via the net instead of the fixed line phone network. Anyone with a broadband connection, which is now more than 50% of the UK's net using population, can use Voip and could slash their monthly phone bills if they used it. Telecommunications regulator Ofcom has declared 056 to be the area code for Voip calls and 2005 is likely to see a lot more consumer-focused Voip call services starting up. Home broadband services will also start to increase in speed as dwindling numbers of new users signing force the pace of competition. If 2004 has been the year of the portable music player, they 2005 looks like it will be the year of the portable media player. Motorola has just announced a deal with Apple to produce a phone that works with the iTunes service and other hybrid gadgets that sport a big memory and lots of other functions will become commonplace. The pace of advancement in storage media will continue mean that the cost per megabyte of memory will plummet. Some of those devices will sport huge hard drives letting you store more data than you ever wanted or knew you had. Convergence could mean that single-function devices start to dwindle in number. Instead every gadget will be able to do almost anything and communicate almost any way you want. The only downside is that consumers will face a series of tough choices as they are confronted by a bewildering array of gadgets each with an enormous numbers of features and vast data holding capacities. But that is the kind of problem most gadget fans can live with. Return to results
Think-tank delivers one of its most upbeat assessments on economy Think-tank delivers one of its most upbeat assessments on economy Prof John Fitzgerald of the ESRI: âOur view is itâs safer to do the â¬3 billion this yearâ The Government risks missing its fiscal targets for next year by opting for a budgetary adjustment of less than â¬3.1 billion, the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI) has warned. In its latest quarterly economic commentary the think-tank delivered one of its most upbeat assessments on the economy since the financial crash, forecasting gross national product (GNP) growth rates of 2 per cent for this year and 2.7 per cent for 2014, well ahead of current Government predictions. However, it warned the reduced budgetary target of â¬2.5 billion, signalled by Minister for Finance Michael Noonan yesterday, could trigger another round of austerity measures in next yearâs budget if the Governmentâs growth forecasts fail to materialise. In its analysis the institute predicted the public finances would come in ahead of target this year, with borrowing at around 7 per cent of GDP, below the troika ceiling target of 7.5 per cent. It said it continued to hold the view that âthe most prudent course of actionâ was to implement an adjustment of â¬3.1 billion in next weekâs budget. Troika target This level of adjustment would reduce the budget deficit to 4.5 per cent of GDP by the end of next year, it said, significantly below the troika target of 5.1 per cent, which would allow the Government end the current sequence of austerity budgets. âOur view is itâs safer to do the â¬3 billion this year, but if they [the Government] do â¬2.5 billion they may get away with it provided the growth forecasts are correct,â said Prof John FitzGerald of the ESRI. Having predicted in July that Irelandâs GNP, a more accurate measure of the countryâs economic activity, would grow by 1.2 per cent this year and 0.5 per cent in 2014, the institute revised these figures upwards to 2 per cent and 2.7 per cent respectively. While it cautioned that the forecasts were heavily reliant on growth predictions in the euro zone and elsewhere, the ESRI said there were now âdefinite signs of recoveryâ coming from several sectors of the economy. The instituteâs forecasts are more optimistic than the Department of Financeâs own projections released yesterday, which predicted GNP would grow by 1 per cent this year and by 1.4 per cent in 2014. However, the ESRI lowered its predictions for GDP growth, the widest measure of wealth created by an individual country, to 0.5 per cent this year and 2.6 per cent for 2014. It cited falling profits in some of Irelandâs biggest pharmaceutical companies as a result of a âpatent cliffâ. Blockbuster drugs Over the last couple of years a number of big blockbuster drugs produced here, most notably cholesterol drug Lipitor, have fallen out of patent. In its commentary the institute said the âclearest signalâ of recovery was reflected by the continued growth in employment and the downward slide in unemployment, which it predicted would fall below 300,000 this year, and continue on a downward trajectory in 2014. It forecast that unemployment would hover at around 13 per cent next year, which was higher than the Department of Financeâs forecast of 12.6 per cent. For the first six months of the year, the ESRI noted, there was an increase of 27,300 in total employment, compared with the first half of 2012. While agriculture, forestry and fishing remained the source of the largest increases in employment, the institute said it believed these sectors may be artificially inflated and that improving employment conditions were more likely coming from expansions within the services sector. .

Three consultants forced to emigrate every month, IHCA conference told Three consultants forced to emigrate every month, IHCA conference told âBrain drainâ caused by poor work conditions, lower pay and budget cuts Ian Carter, the HSEâs director of acute services: warned of further dysfunction if the Government kept taking money out of the system. Photograph: Dave Meehan. Hospital consultants are emigrating at the rate of three a month because of deteriorating working conditions, lower pay and âunrelentingâ budget cuts, their annual conference has heard. The Irish Hospital Consultantsâ Association warned at the weekend of a âbrain drainâ forcing some of the countryâs best consultants to leave the country and seek work overseas. Younger consultants have as little as half an hour a fortnight of operating theatre time because of a lack of beds, nurses and anaesthetists, the conference also heard. Vacant posts Doctors often go overseas when training to improve their skills but the IHCA says it is virtually unprecedented for mid-career senior consultants with positions in Irish hospitals to emigrate again, as they are now. One in five consultant posts in the public system are either vacant or filled on a temporary basis. Speaking at the conference in Maynooth, Co Kildare, IHCA president Denis Evoy said the continued degradation of consultantsâ working conditions and contracts was changing the medical landscape in Ireland and creating a system that cannot cater for its patients. âIrelandâs health service is being run with a focus on the implementation of declining annual budget rather than encouraging excellence across the system and making patients the priority.â Mr Evoy said as Ireland competed globally for medical staff it could not recruit and retain the most talented doctors and consultants. âThe brightest and best graduates, having finished prestigious fellowships, are accepting well-resourced and well-remunerated posts in America, Australia and New Zealand . The prolonged expectation of the HSE that consultants will endure declining working conditions, uncompetitive contracts and systems failures that result in compromised patient care cannot continue. The inability to appoint permanent consultants with appropriate contracts is impacting on patients directly through growing waiting lists, longer waiting times and cancellations of elective surgery.â The system was dealing with an additional 230,000 patients a year while budgets were about 25 per cent lower, he pointed out. Frontline staff could not continue delivering the services expected of them while maintaining âacceptableâ levels of patient care. Closures needed He suggested a âre-alignmentâ of resources, to include the closure at night of half the countryâs 28 24-hour emergency departments. He acknowledged the proposal was politically controversial but added that âwe just canât go onâ staffing emergency departments in close proximity to each other. Kilkenny and Waterford , which both have 24-hour facilities, are just 20 minutes apart, while Loughlinstown was six miles away from St Vincentâs in Dublin. The consolidation of cancer care into eight centres from an original 31 had greatly improved outcomes for patients, he pointed out. Prof Paddy Broe , president of the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland , said many consultants were spending long hours doing non-medical work while others struggled to get even half a day of operating time each week. Young surgeons risked becoming deskilled, and the system risked them becoming disaffected if left idle. He said the college had changed its training system after noticing a fall in the number and quality of applicants to study surgery, and an increase in the dropout rate. HSE national director of acute hospitals Ian Carter warned of further dysfunction if the Government kept taking money out of the system. He said the premise put forward by the Department of Public Expenditure that the health services were inherently inefficient had to be challenged. Mr Carter said the budget had been cut by 22 per cent since 2008 and much cutting had been crude, for purely fiscal reasons. Return to results
UK economy grows at fastest pace in three years UK economy grows at fastest pace in three years GDP increases by 0.8% in third quarter of year, new figures show British chancellor of the exchequer George Osborne said the 0.8% rise in UK economic output,showed the âcountry is on the path to prosperityâ. Photograph: Nigel Roddis/Getty Images The UK economy grew at its fastest pace for three years in the third quarter of the year as gross domestic product (GDP) increased by 0.8 per cent, official figures showed today. It was the third successive period of improving output and the best performance since the second quarter of 2010, the Office for National Statistics said. The figures, which were in line with expectations, saw all sectors of the economy grow, including a 2.5 per cent surge in construction. Chancellor George Osborne said on Twitter: âThis shows that Britainâs hard work is paying off & the country is on the path to prosperity.â Overall GDP was 1.5 per cent ahead of the same period last year â a strong comparison with a time when the economy was boosted by the Olympics and Paralympics. The year-to-year rise is higher than the 1.3 per cent improvement at the end of this yearâs second quarter. But the economy remains 2.5 per cent off its pre-recession peak at the start of 2008. During the third quarter, construction was boosted by new work on private housing and private commercial building as well as domestic home repair and maintenance. Housebuilders have been buoyed by the Governmentâs Help to Buy scheme, which recently launched a new phase offering mortgage guarantees. However, construction remains 12.5 per cent off its pre-crisis peak. Production grew by 0.5 per cent, though this remains 12.8 per cent off its 2008 level, while within this manufacturing improved 0.9 per cent in the third quarter. It is 8.9 per cent off the level five years ago. Meanwhile, the powerhouse services sector, which represents three-quarters of economic output, grew by 0.7 per cent and is now 0.6 per cent above its pre-crisis peak. The largest contributions here came from business services and finance, followed by distribution, hotels and restaurants. PA .

Virus poses as Christmas e-mail Virus poses as Christmas e-mail Security firms are warning about a Windows virus disguising itself as an electronic Christmas card. The Zafi.D virus translates the Christmas greeting on its subject line into the language of the person receiving infected e-mail. Anti-virus firms speculate that this multilingual ability is helping the malicious program spread widely online. Anti-virus firm Sophos said that 10% of the e-mail currently on the net was infected with the Zafi virus. Like many other Windows viruses, Zafi-D plunders Microsoft Outlook for e-mail addresses and then uses mail-sending software to despatch itself across the web to new victims. To be infected users must open up the attachment travelling with the message which bears the code for the malicious bug. The attachment on the e-mail poses as an electronic Christmas card but anyone opening it will simply get a crude image of two smiley faces. The virus' subject line says "Merry Christmas" and translates this into one of 15 languages depending of the final suffix of the e-mail address the infected message has been sent to. The message in the body of the e-mail reads: "Happy Holidays" and this too is translated. On infected machines the virus tries to disable anti-virus and firewall software and opens up a backdoor on the PC to hand over control to the writer of the virus. The virus is thought to have spread most widely in South America, Italy, Spain, Bulgaria and Hungary. The original Zafi virus appeared in April this year. "We have seen these hoaxes for several Christmases already, and personally I prefer traditional pen and paper cards, and we recommend this to all our clients too," said Mikko Hypponen, who heads F-Secure's anti-virus team.

Warning over Windows Word files Warning over Windows Word files Writing a Microsoft Word document can be a dangerous business, according to document security firm Workshare. Up to 75% of all business documents contained sensitive information most firms would not want exposed, a survey by the firm revealed. To make matters worse 90% of those companies questioned had no idea that confidential information was leaking. The report warns firms to do a better job of policing documents as corporate compliance becomes more binding. Sensitive information inadvertently leaked in documents includes confidential contractual terms, competitive information that rivals would be keen to see and special deals for key customers, said Andrew Pearson, European boss of Workshare which commissioned the research. "The efficiencies the internet has brought in such as instant access to information have also created security and control issues too," he said. The problem is particularly acute with documents prepared using Microsoft Word because of the way it maintains hidden records about editing changes. As documents get passed around, worked on and amended by different staff members the sensitive information finds its way into documents. Poor control over the editing and amending process can mean that information that should be expunged survives final edits. Microsoft, however, does provide an add-on tool for Windows PCs that fixes the problem. "The Remove Hidden Data add-in is a tool that you can use to remove personal or hidden data that might not be immediately apparent when you view the document in your Microsoft Office application," says the instructions on Microsoft's website. Microsoft recommends that the tool is used before people publish any Word document. A tool for Apple machines running Word is not available. Workshare surveyed firms around the world and found that, on average, 31% of documents contained legally sensitive information but in many firms up to three-quarters fell in to the high risk category. Often, said Mr Pearson, this sensitive information was invisible because it got deleted and changed as different drafts were prepared. However, the way that Windows works means that earlier versions can be recalled and reconstructed by those keen to see how a document has evolved. Few firms have any knowledge of the existence of this so-called metadata about the changes that a document has gone through or that it can be reconstructed. The discovery of this hidden information could prove embarrassing for companies if, for instance, those tendering for contracts found out about the changes to terms of a deal being negotiated. The research revealed that a document's metadata could be substantial as, on average, only 40% of contributors' changes to a document make it to the final draft. Problems with documents could mean trouble for firms as regulatory bodies step up scrutiny and compliance laws start to bite, said Mr Pearson. Return to results
Web radio takes Spanish rap global Web radio takes Spanish rap global Spin the radio dial in the US and you are likely to find plenty of Spanish-language music. But what you will not find is much Spanish-language hip-hop. Hip-hop and rap are actually quite popular in the Spanish-speaking world, but local artists are having trouble marketing their work abroad. But now, a US company is bringing rap and hip-hop en espanol to computer users everywhere. Los Caballeros de Plan G are one of Mexico's hottest hip-hop acts. They have a devoted fan base in their native Monterrey. But most Mexican hip-hop fans, not to mention fans in most of the Spanish-speaking world, rarely get a chance to hear the group's tracks on the radio. "You can't really just go on the radio and listen to hip-hop in Spanish... it's just not accessible," says Manuel Millan, a native of San Diego, California. "It's really hard for the Spanish hip-hop scene to get into mainstream radio. You usually have a very commercialised sound and the groups are not really known around the country or around the world." Millan and two friends set out to change that - they wanted to make groups like Los Caballeros de Plan G accessible to fans globally. Mainstream radio stations were not going to play this kind of music, and starting their own broadcast station was economically impossible. So, Millan and his friends launched a website called latinohiphopradio.com. The name says it all: it is web-based radio, devoted to the hottest Spanish language rap and hip-hop tracks. The site, which is in both in English and Spanish, is meant to be easy to navigate. All the user has to do is download a media player. There are no DJs. It is just music streamed over the net for free. Suddenly, with the help of the website, Los Caballeros de Plan G are producing "export quality" rap. The web might be just the right medium for Spanish language hip-hop right now. The genre is in what Millan calls its "infant stage". But the production values are improving, and artists such as Argentina's Mustafa Yoda are pushing to make it better and better. Mustafa Yoda is currently one of the hottest tracks on latinohiphopradio.com. "He's considered the Eminem of Argentina, and the Latin American hip-hop scene," Millan says. "He really hasn't had that much exposure as far as anywhere in the world, but he's definitely the one to look out for as far as becoming the next big thing in the Spanish-speaking world." Currently, the Chilean group Makisa is also in latinohiphopradio.com's top 10, as is Cuban artist Papo Record. "Every country's got it's own cultural differences and they try to put those into their own songs," Millan says. Latinohiphopradio.com has been up and running for a couple of months now. The site has listeners from across the Spanish speaking world. Right now, Mexico leads the way, accounting for about 50% of listeners. But web surfers in Spain are logging in as well - about 25% of the web station's traffic comes from there. That is not surprising as many consider Spain to be the leader in Spanish-language rap and hip-hop. Millan says that Spain is actually just behind the United States and France in terms of overall rap and hip-hop production. That might be changing, though, as more and more Latin American artists are finding audiences. But one Spaniard is still firmly in latinohiphopradio.com's top 10. His name is Tote King and Manuel Millan says that he is the hip-hop leader in Spain. On his track Uno Contra Veinte Emcees, or One Against 20 Emcees, Tote King shows he is well aware of that fact. "It's basically him bragging that he's one of the best emcees in Spain right now," Millan says. "And it's pretty much true. He has the tightest productions, and his rap flow is impeccable, it's amazing." Latinohiphopradio.com is hoping to expand in the coming year. Millan says they want to include more music and more news from the world of Spanish language hip-hop and rap.

Wenger dejected as Arsenal slump Wenger dejected as Arsenal slump Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger claimed their display in the 3-1 defeat against Bayern Munich was "our worst peformance in the Champions League". Kolo Toure's late goal gives the Gunners hope for the second leg, but Wenger said: "The only positive is that we are still in the tie. "The players are really down in the dressing-room. I feel we really turned in a bad performance. "At 3-0 we faced a real struggle, but 3-1 at least gives us a chance." Goalscorer Toure was also at fault for two goals, and Wenger said: "We need to help Toure rebuild his confidence as he is low at the moment." Wenger also tried to stay upbeat himself, adding: "But there is enough time for crying. I could cry - maybe it would be easier - but life goes on. "In this job, you have good and bad nights. This was a bad night - but I still have confidence in the quality of my players, as well as their spirit and desire." But Wenger's Bayern counterpart Felix Magath was in no mood to celebrate either. He said: "I am far from happy despite the win. My players failed to try and score a fourth to kill the tie and then conceded the late goal. "Arsenal are fully capable of scoring several goals against us on their own turf." Arsenal keeper Jens Lehmann, whose personal rivalry with Bayern goalkeeper Oliver Kahn was not helped by the result, said: "Do I blame myself for the third goal? As a goalkeeper, I always blame myself. "I just know the goals were very easy against us. In my time here, we have never conceded three easy goals like that - but sometimes it happens. "It would have been impossible to go through at 3-0 - but with the goal we have chances. Everything is now possible." Return to results
â¬125 million State-backed investment fund to back medium-sized Irish businesses. â¬125 million State-backed investment fund to back medium-sized Irish businesses. Richard Bruton, our relentlessly jolly Minister for Job Announcements, looked particularly pleased with himself yesterday at the launch of the new â¬125 million State-backed investment fund for medium-sized Irish businesses. Richard Bruton , our relentlessly jolly Minister for Job Announcements, looked particularly pleased with himself yesterday at the launch of the new â¬125 million State-backed investment fund for medium-sized Irish businesses. The fund will take equity stakes in medium-sized Irish firms with growth potential. The State agency Enterprise Ireland has coughed up a quarter of the fund, while AIB , which may as well be a state agency, has committed â¬20 million. The rest of the cash will come from foreign investors, surely the main reason for Brutonâs jollity. It is one thing to have foreign investors crawling all over the country seeking out distressed asset buys, building Viagra factories or coining it on Irish Government bonds. It is another thing altogether to attract foreign cash into the State to be risked on existing indigenous, growing businesses. During the boom, the capital structure of the entire economy became lopsided. Much of the equity that would ordinarily have been available to invest in growing Irish businesses was diverted instead towards property deals, where the returns were much higher. This forced many growing Irish firms to rely too heavily on debt financing instead, although if there wasnât a property angle to the deal the banks were less interested. How ironic, then, to see that the property industry is effectively barred from applying to the fund launched yesterday. The â¬125 million is just a tiny fraction of the cash needed to help alleviate the capital famine that has starved the indigenous economy in recent years. But itâs a welcome start. .

Ajax refuse to rule out Jol move Ajax refuse to rule out Jol move Ajax have refused to reveal whether Tottenham's boss Martin Jol is on the Dutch champions' shortlist to become the Amsterdam club's new coach. Jol, who has coached in his native Holland, has guided Spurs to the Premiership's top eight. An Ajax spokesman told Online News Sport: "The coach must fit our profile - a coach who understands the Dutch league and offensive and distinctive football. "We need to find a solution soon, so someone is in place for next season." Ronald Koeman quit as Ajax boss last week after their exit from the Uefa Cup. Jol has been linked with the vacant post at Ajax, with reports saying he has fallen out with Spurs' sporting director Frank Arnesen. But in a statement on Spurs' website, Jol said: "I'm happy here, I'm not in discussion with anyone else, I don't want to go elsewhere." Ajax have enlisted the help of Dutch legend Johann Cruyff, currently a consultant at Barcelona, to help find a new head coach. Cruyff has admitted he has been impressed by the way former RFC Waalwijk coach Jol has turned round Spurs' fortunes since taking over from Jacques Santini. Tonny Bruins Slot and Ruud Krol are currently in charge of Ajax, who are third in the Dutch league. Comments are closed for this article.
Apple makes blogs reveal sources Apple makes blogs reveal sources Apple has won its legal fight to make three bloggers reveal who told them about unreleased products. The bid to unmask the employees leaking information was launched in December 2004 following online articles about Apple's Asteroid product. Now Apple has won the right to see e-mail records from the three bloggers to root out the culprit. A lawyer for the three bloggers said the ruling set a dangerous precedent that could harm all news reporters. Apple's lawsuit accused anonymous people of stealing trade secrets about the Asteroid music product and leaking them to the PowerPage, Apple Insider and Think Secret websites. All three are Apple fan sites that obsessively watch the iconic firm for information about future products. Apple is notoriously secretive about upcoming products which gives any snippets of information about what it is working on all the more value. The lawsuit to reveal the names of the leakers was filed against the Power Page and Apple Insider sites. The separate legal fight with Think Secret has yet to be resolved. In the ruling handed down this week by Santa Clara County Superior Court Judge James Kleinberg, Apple can now get its hands on e-mail records from the bloggers' net providers. In making his ruling, Judge Kleinberg said that laws covering the divulging of trade secrets outweighed considerations of public interest. California has so-called "shield" laws which protect journalists from prosecution if what they are writing about can be shown to be in the public interest. The Judge wrote: "...it is not surprising that hundreds of thousands of 'hits' on a website about Apple have and will happen. But an interested public is not the same as the public interest". Judge Kleinberg said the question of whether the bloggers were journalists or not did not apply because laws governing the right to keep trade secrets confidential covered journalists, too. The Electronic Frontier Foundation, which is acting as legal counsel for Power Page and Apple Insider, said the ruling had potentially wide implications. "Anyone who reports on companies or the trade press should be concerned about this ruling," said EFF lawyer Kurt Opsahl. Mr Opsahl said the EFF was planning to appeal against the ruling because the bloggers were journalists and US federal laws stop net firms handing over copies of e-mail messages if the owner of that account does not give their consent.

Argonaut founder rebuilds empire Argonaut founder rebuilds empire Jez San, the man behind the Argonaut games group which went into administration a week ago, has bought back most of the company. The veteran games developer has taken over the Cambridge-based Just Add Monsters studios and the London subsidiary Morpheme. The Argonaut group went into administration due to a severe cash crisis, firing about half of its staff. In August it had warned of annual losses of Â£6m for the year to 31 July. Jez San is one of the key figures in the UK's games industry. The developer, who received an OBE in 2002, was estimated to have been worth more than Â£200m at the peak of the dotcom boom. He founded Argonaut in 1982 and has been behind titles such as 1993 Starfox game. More recently it was behind the Harry Potter games for the PlayStation. But, like all software developers, Argonaut needed a constant flow of deals with publishers. In August it warned of annual losses of Â£6m, blaming delays in signing new contracts and tough conditions in the software industry. The group's three subsidiaries were placed in administration a week ago, with Mr Sans resigning as the company's CEO and some 100 staff being fired. After the latest round of cuts, there were 80 workers at Argonaut headquarters in Edgware in north London, with 17 at its Morpheme offices in Kentish Town, London, and 22 at the Just Add Monsters base in Cambridge. Mr San has re-emerged, buying back Morpheme and Just Add Monsters. "We are pleased to announce the sale of these two businesses as going concerns," said David Rubin of administrators David Rubin & Partners. "This has saved over 40 jobs as well as the substantial employment claims that would have arisen had the sales not been achieved." Mr Rubin said the administrators were in talks over the sale of the Argonaut software division in Edgware and were hopeful of finding a buyer. "This is a very difficult time for all the employees there, but I salute their commitment to the business while we work towards a solution," he said. Some former employees are angry at the way cash crisis was handled. One told Online News News Online that the staff who had been fired had been "financially ruined in the space of a day".

Arsenal 1-1 Sheff Utd Arsenal 1-1 Sheff Utd Andy Gray's 90th-minute penalty earned Sheffield United a deserved FA Cup replay against 10-man Arsenal. Robert Pires' close-range finish looked to have sent the Gunners into the quarter-finals. But referee Neale Barry pointed to the spot after Philippe Senderos' handball and Gray sent the keeper the wrong way. In an incident-packed game, Arsenal captain Dennis Bergkamp was controversially sent off in the first half for a shove on Danny Cullip. And Cullip subsequently had a headed goal disallowed as United took advantage of a makeshift Arsenal team. Gunners boss Arsene Wenger, already without Sol Campbell, Ashley Cole and Edu, opted to rest Patrick Vieira and Thierry Henry. And while they looked promising going forward, the defence never looked comfortable, particularly against set-pieces. They suffered an early scare when Gray was given a free header but keeper Manuel Almunia palmed away his attempt at the second opportunity. Blades boss Neil Warnock had earmarked Bergkamp as Arsenal's key man and Phil Jagielka was charged with keeping a close eye on the Dutchman. The veteran striker was nonetheless controlling Arsenal's attacking play until his departure. He came closest to giving Arsenal a first-half lead when he saw his curling shot brush the top of the net. However, his influence was brought to an abrupt end after 35 minutes in an incident which began with a late challenge on Cesc Fabregas. A melee ensued and referee Barry picked out Bergkamp, who seemed only to push Cullip, for punishment, leaving Wenger incredulous. The controversy continued in a frantic end to the half. Cullip thought he had put his side ahead when he flicked home Leigh Bromby's long throw-in - but the referee saw a foul. The half ended on another sour note when Fabregas left Nick Montgomery motionless with a shocking late tackle. Fabregas was lucky to escape with just a booking, but Montgomery was perhaps luckier to get up from the challenge. The second half began in relative calm but burst into life again when Reyes was denied a penalty - and seconds later was booked for an ugly challenge on Jon Harley. Arsenal looked to have avoided a replay when Pires tapped in 12 minutes from the end after United keeper Paddy Kenny had parried Fabregas' shot. But Senderos handled Cullip's hooked shot giving Gray the chance to equalise - and he took it with aplomb. The replay will be at Bramall Lane on Tuesday 1 March. - Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger: "The boys responded very well (to Bergkamp's sending-off). "The second half was all us and we had three good chances to score a second goal. In the end we got caught. "But overall the performance was good. The young lads can be very proud." - Sheffield United manager Neil Warnock: "It is a fantastic result for me personally and the club. "It is not very often that you come to a place like this and get the right result. It looked like it was going to be a bit cruel. "I didn't think we deserved to lose. When they scored I think everyone wrote us off but we have got a lot of character in the team."

Bad e-mail habits sustains spam Bad e-mail habits sustains spam The 'bad behaviour' of e-mail users is helping to sustain the spam industry, a new study has found. According to a survey conducted by security firm Mirapoint and market research company the Radicati Group, nearly a third of e-mail users have clicked on links in spam messages. One in ten users have bought products advertised in junk mail. Clicking on a link in a spam message can expose people to viruses and alert spammers to live e-mail accounts. The fact that one in ten e-mail users are buying things advertised in spam continues to make it an attractive business, especially given that sending out huge amounts of spam costs very little, the report concludes. "This preliminary data is surprising and somewhat shocking to us," said Marcel Nienhuis, market analyst at the Radicati Group. "It explains why e-mail security threats including spam, viruses and phishing scams continue to proliferate," he said, accusing users of "bad e-mail behaviour". Spammers are increasingly hooking into whatever happens to be flavour of the month, according to security firm Clearswift. It has recently seen a rise in the number of spam messages offering phoney Sony PSP giveaways. And, in perhaps a nod to the popularity of the American drama series Desperate Housewives, it has also seen a dramatic rise in junk mails purporting to give details of women looking for casual sex. But rather than finding a companion, users who click on such mail will find themselves redirected to porn sites, where they run the risk of downloading spyware on to their PC. Clearswift has seen a 180% rise in sex-related spam over the course of the last month. "Without casting aspersions, those likely to respond to these kind of adverts will be invariably hoping that 'one thing leads to another' but aside from the fact that these mails are bogus, clicking on any link within a spam mail can lead to a whole host of unwanted problems," said Alyn Hockey, Clearswift's director of research. Sexually explicit terms make up 14% of security firm Sophos' top 50 word that spammers most commonly try to disguise in order to beat anti-spam filters. Spammers will deliberately misspell a word or use digits instead of letters in an attempt to by-pass anti-spam software, said Graham Cluley, senior technology consultant for security firm Sophos. "The list of words most commonly hidden by the spammers from anti-spam software reveals that most spam is about the old favourites: money, drugs and sex," said Mr Cluley. But anti-spam filters can only be part of the solution to the menace of junk e-mail. "People must resist their basic instincts to buy from spam mails. Spammers are criminals, plain and simple. If no-one responded to junk e-mail and didn't buy products sold in this way, then spam would be as extinct as the dinosaurs," he said. Return to results
Bayern Munich 3-1 Arsenal Bayern Munich 3-1 Arsenal Arsenal's Champions League hopes hang by a thread after a nightmare performance against Bayern Munich. Claudio Pizarro took advantage of Kolo Toure's mistake to volley Bayern ahead after only four minutes. And Pizarro profited from more poor defending by Toure to head Mehmet Scholl's free kick past goalkeeper Jens Lehmann 12 minutes after half-time. Hasan Salihamidzic volleyed a third on 64 minutes, but Toure pulled a vital goal back with only two minutes left. It salvaged something from a dreadful display by Arsene Wenger's side, and the fact that they failed to create a serious chance until the final minutes underlines the size of the task they face in the second leg at Highbury. The Gunners were forced to restrict Ashley Cole to a place on the bench when he failed to recover from a virus - and their problems worsened inside four minutes. Oliver Kahn's long clearance was met by a poor headed clearance by Toure, and Pizarro met it first time on the volley from 12 yards to give Jens Lehmann no chance. Arsenal had failed to make any attacking impact, and they lost another key figure 10 minutes before the interval, when Edu limped off with a hamstring injury to be replaced by Mathieu Flamini. Their first moment of threat came four minutes before the interval, when Gael Clichy's shot was deflected narrowly wide with Kahn well beaten. Lehmann, jeered throughout by the Bayern crowd because of his bad relationship with Germany's number one goalkeeper and arch-rival Kahn, came to Arsenal's rescue after 51 minutes. Ze Roberto's cross was met on the full by Roy Makaay, and Lehmann reacted brilliantly to turn his effort over the top. But there was no escape after 57 minutes as Bayern doubled their lead, and it was another nightmare moment for Toure. Pizarro lost Toure from Scholl's free-kick and he headed powerfully past Lehmann, who had no chance. And Bayern were out of sight seven minutes later as Arsenal's Champions League hopes looked to have been extinguished. Lehmann could only palm out Martin Demichelis' cross, and Salihamidzic finished with a flourish with a side-footed volley at the far post. But Arsenal grabbed at a slender lifeline when Toure bundled home from close range after Patrick Vieira had hit the post.

Bellamy fined after row Bellamy fined after row Newcastle have fined their Welsh striker Craig Bellamy two weeks' wages - about Â£80,000 - following his row with manager Graeme Souness. But Bellamy, 25, has not been put on the transfer list, although he did not train with the first team on Tuesday. Magpies chairman Freddy Shepherd told the Newcastle Evening Chronicle: "It is not about money. It is about a player thinking he is bigger than this club. "No individual is, be it the chairman, the manager or a player." Souness dropped Bellamy for Sunday's game against Arsenal, claiming the Welshman had feigned injury after being asked to play out of position. "When I heard what the manager was saying I was in shock," Bellamy said. "I thought 'not only has he gone behind my back, he's lying'," he said in response to Souness' remarks. And the Wales international refused to apologise. "I won't apologise because I have done nothing wrong," he told the Evening Chronicle. "There's no doubt about it, I am out of here." The difficult relationship between Souness and Bellamy boiled over at the weekend, and has led to a war of words in the media. Bellamy's claim that Souness had lied about the background to the bust-up was strongly denied by Shepherd, who accused the striker of "cheating" the club. "I wish to put the record straight regarding the Bellamy situation," said Shepherd. "Craig walked off the training ground saying his hamstring was tight (on Friday), but what he failed to reveal was that he had told other members of the squad before training that he intended to feign injury. "When Graeme discovered this he immediately ordered Bellamy to attend a meeting in my office. "At that meeting Bellamy admitted to Graeme and I that he had told the players that he was going to "fake" an injury in training and walk off. "He also agreed at that meeting to apologise to his team-mates for his behaviour. He didn't do this which resulted in the action taken by the manager at the weekend, which I fully support. "In my book this is cheating on the club, the supporters, the manager and his own team-mates. "He is paid extremely well and I consider his behaviour to be totally unacceptable and totally unprofessional." Bellamy's latest outburst would appear to make his chances of a first-team recall remote. But even before Newcastle said the player would not be sold, Bellamy insisted he had no intention of handing in a transfer request. "I don't want the fans to think for one minute that I wouldn't play for this club," he said. "I'd play anywhere for this club, even in goal. "It's a very difficult situation for me at the moment but I'd never ask to leave this club. "This club means so much to me. I couldn't do it because I know I couldn't come back here and play against Newcastle. It would hurt too much." Comments are closed for this article.
Benitez delight after crucial win Benitez delight after crucial win Liverpool manager Rafael Benitez admitted victory against Deportivo La Coruna was vital in their tight Champions League group. Jorge Andrade's early own goal gave Liverpool a 1-0 win. And Benitez said: "We started at a very high tempo and had many chances. It is a very important win for us and we could have scored more goals. "We were very good defensively and also good on the counter attack. We are pleased but move on to the next game." Igor Biscan was outstanding in midfield after replacing injured Xabi Alonso, and Benitez said: "He played very well. "It is important to have all the players ready and a good squad so you can play more games at a high level." Benitez added: "It is all back in our own hands now, it was a great win for us and I was delighted with what I feel was the best Liverpool I have seen. "As far as my feelings about winning in Spain, that is really not important. "I want to see us win away matches in the Champions League, that it was in Spain was not my first consideration. "As far as I am concerned it is important for Liverpool to win, it is not important in what country it is in." Benitez added: Benitez said: "We had a problem before the start, it was decided that Xabi could not play more than 45 minutes. "But in the end because of the way that (Dietmar) Hamann and (Igor) Biscan performed, we did not need to change things until right at the end of the match. "Depor are a good team and if you allow them to keep possession they can be very dangerous indeed. "But we knew that if we hit them on the counter-attack it would make them nervous, and that is how it worked out." Deportivo coach Javier Irureta said: "Liverpool played very well and we just could not break them down. "I know we have now gone six games at home in Europe without scoring, but that does not reflect our overall performances. "But this time we did not play well and we lacked imagination. "The goal was a bad mistake and a big blow to our confidence. Players who usually want the ball at that stage did not want it. "I know we are bottom of the group, but as long as there is hope of qualifying, we will hang on to that." Return to results
Big war games battle it out Big war games battle it out The arrival of new titles in the popular Medal Of Honor and Call of Duty franchises leaves fans of wartime battle titles spoilt for choice. The acclaimed PC title Call of Duty has been updated for console formats, building on many of the original's elements. For its part, the long-running Medal of Honor series has added Pacific Assault to its PC catalogue, adapting the console game Rising Sun. Call of Duty: Finest Hour casts you as a succession of allied soldiers fighting on World War 2 battlefronts including Russia and North Africa. It is a traditional first-person-viewed game that lets you control just one character, in the midst of a unit where cohorts constantly bark orders at you. On a near-identical note, Medal of Honor: Pacific Assault does all it can to make you feel part of a tight-knit team and plum in the middle of all-out action. Its arenas are the war's Pacific battles, including Guadalcanal and Pearl Harbour. You play one character throughout, a raw and rather talkative US soldier. Both games rely on a carefully stage-managed structure that keeps things ticking along. When this works, it is a brilliant device to make you feel part of a story. When it does not, it is tedious. A winning moment is an early scene in Pacific Assault, where you come under attack at the famous US base in Hawaii. You are first ushered into a gunboat attacking the incoming waves of Japanese planes, then made to descend into a sinking battleship to rescue crewman, before seizing the anti-aircraft guns. It is one of the finest set-pieces ever seen in a video game. This notion of shuffling the player along a studiously pre-determined path, forcibly witnessing a series of pre-set moments of action, is a perilous business which can make the whole affair feel stilted rather than organic. The genius of something like Half Life 2 is that it skilfully disguises its linear plotting by various means of misdirection. This pair of games do not really accomplish that, being more concerned with imparting a full-on atmospheric experience. Call of Duty comes with a suitably bombastic score and overblown presentation. Finest Hour has a similar determination, framing everything in moody wartime music, archive footage and lots of reflective voice-overs. Letting you play a number of different roles is an interesting ploy that adds new dimensions to the Call of Duty endeavour, even if it sacrifices the narrative flow somewhat. The game's drawback could be said to be its format; tastes differ, but these wartime shooters often do seem to work better on PC. The mouse control is a big reason why, along with the sharper graphics a top-end computer can muster and the apparent notion that PC games are allowed to get away with a bit more subtlety. Call of Duty on PC was more detailed, plot-wise and graphically, and this new adaptation feels a little rough and ready. Targeting with the PS2 controller proved tricky, not helped by unconvincing collision-detection. You can shoot an enemy repeatedly with zero question as to your aim, yet the bullets will just refuse to hit him. Checkpoints are so few and far between that when you get shot, which happens regularly, you are set harshly far back, and will find yourself covering vast tracts of scorched earth again and again. The game wants to be a challenge, and is, and many players will like it for that. It is as dynamic a battlefield simulator as you will experience and even if it is not as refined as its PC parent, the sense of being part of the action is thoroughly impressive. Both of these games feature military colleagues who are disturbingly bad shots and prone to odd behaviour. And in Pacific Assault in particular, their commands and comments are irritatingly meaningless. But the teamwork element in titles like this is superficial, designed to add atmosphere and camaraderie rather than affect the gameplay mechanics at all. Of the two games, Pacific Assault gets more things right, including little points like auto-saving intelligently and having tidier presentation. It engages you very well and also looks wonderful, making the most of the lush tropical settings that are reminiscent of the glorious Far Cry, although we had to ramp up the settings on a high-spec machine to get the most out of them. Finest Hour is by no means bad, and it is only because the PC original was so dazzling that this version sometimes feels underwhelming. Those looking for a wartime game with plenty of atmosphere and a hearty abundance of enemies to shoot will be contented. But they will also have a niggling puzzlement as to why it does not break a little more ground rather then just being competent. Return to results
Bookies pay out on Spurs 'goal' Bookies pay out on Spurs 'goal' A bookmaker will pay out to punters who bet on Pedro Mendes to score the first goal in Tottenham's controversial game against Manchester United. The match at Old Trafford finished goalless after Mendes' long-range shot was fumbled by home keeper Roy Carroll. TV replays showed the ball went over the line, but the incident was missed by the referee and his assistant. William Hill is to honour bets on 20-1 chance Mendes to score first, although rival firm Ladbrokes will not. Hills spokesman Graham Sharpe admitted only a handful of customers had backed Mendes to score first. Bets struck at 11-2 on Mendes to score at anytime during the match will also be settled. "We have decided to pay out to - the admittedly few - customers who would have definitely been on a winner had the goal been given as it quite obviously should have been," said Sharpe. Meanwhile, Paddy Power bookmakers will refund all losing bets on Spurs to win the match. The Irish firm is now offering odds of just 7-2 that a video referee is used in the 2005 FA Cup final. But not everyone will be celebrating, with Britain's biggest bookmaker Ladbrokes refusing to bend the rules. "As much as we sympathise with punters who backed Spurs, the referee's decision is final," said spokesman Balthazar Fabricius. "Besides which, if we were to pay out on bad refereeing decisions, we'd be paying out every week. We want better refereeing as much as punters do." And the William Hill concession does not apply to correct score or outright bet results. "No-one can say for sure what the final score would have been had the Mendes goal been allowed - after all, in the past United have scored twice in the final minute of a match," said Sharpe.

Britain pledges access to tax evasion-busting database Britain pledges access to tax evasion-busting database Government hopes to put more pressure on firms seeking to hide wealth and profits A new database of company ownership details, designed to expose international money laundering and tax evasion schemes, will be opened up to public scrutiny, British prime minister David Cameron has said. The plan advances Mr Cameronâs efforts to push money laundering and tax evasion to the top of the global agenda, and follows up on a debate at the G8 summit of the eight of the worldâs wealthiest states in June. The âbeneficial ownership registerâ goes beyond the existing registration of corporations and shareholders by untangling deliberately opaque ownership structures to help authorities track down those who are using low-tax regimes overseas to illegally reduce their tax bills. By making the data public, a decision taken after a consultation with businesses and pressure groups, the government hopes to put more pressure on firms and individuals seeking to hide wealth and profits. âFor too long a small minority have hidden their business dealings behind a complicated web of shell companies - and this cloak of secrecy has fuelled all manners of questionable practice and downright illegality,â Mr Cameron said at an conference in London promoting open governance. Mr Cameron urged other countries to follow suit. At Juneâs G8 summit he was unable to secure a concrete agreement from leaders to guarantee they would take similar steps, only a promise that they would draw up a plan to provide more data on company ownership. The question of how much tax corporations pay - especially when the government has imposed cuts on ordinary people to reduce Britainâs debt pile - has been highlighted by disclosures that companies such as Starbucks and Amazon pay little or no tax into British coffers, provoking a public and political uproar. While they operate within the rules to minimise their tax burden, it is hoped the new register will shine a light on firms illegally evading paying tax. Britainâs register will hold information on those who have 25 per cent or more of a companyâs shares or voting rights, or who otherwise control the way it is run, the government said. However, Mr Cameron confirmed it would not cover complex trust structures which can also be used in tax avoidance schemes. Campaigners said that by making the first move with the register, Britain had set a welcome precedent for others. Mr Cameronâs attempts to cut tax evasion have been complicated by the fact that Britain is seen as a market leader in giving access to offshore tax havens in former British colonies.

As a telecoms company, BT is moving to a content distribution strategy, Andrew Burke, chief of BT's new Entertainment unit told the IPTV World Forum. "We want to be an entertainment facilitator," he said on the opening day of the London conference. The Online News is also trialling a service to play programmes over the net and has not ruled out offering it to non-licence fee payers overseas. The corporation's Interactive Media Player (iMP) is its first foray into broadband TV - known as IPTV (Internet Protocol TV). "We see several opportunities for delivering the type of content that normally broadcasters find it difficult to get to viewers," said BT's Andrew Burke. With more people on broadband, and connection speeds increasing, telcos around the world are looking for new ways to make money from it. Increased competition between net service providers, encouraged by Ofcom, has eroded BT's position in the market. It is looking for a good return on its investment in the technology which has made broadband over ADSL a reality. It also sees delivering TV over broadband as a way of getting high-definition (HD) content to people sooner than they will be able to get it through conventional, regular broadcasts. The Online News's iMP has just finished successful technical trials and is set for much larger consumer trials later in 2005. Before it officially launches, the Online News must show the government how it offers value for money. Delivering programmes over broadband offers clear public value, says the Online News, because it gives people more control, and more choice. IPTV is a similar idea to VoIP services, like Skype. Both use broadband net connections to carry information, like video and voice, in packets of data instead of conventional means. Since it uses internet technology, IPTV could mean more choice of programmes, more, more interactivity, tailored programming, and more localised content outside of conventional satellite, digital cable, and terrestrial broadcasts. It is all part of the larger changing TV technology landscape and, like personal digital video recorders (PVRs), gives people much more control over TV. Broadcasters see IPTV and PVRs as both as a threat and an opportunity. The Online News recognises that TV over broadband is a reality and aims to innovate with it, said Rahul Chakkara, controller of Online Newsi's 24/7 interactive TV services. The iMP is based on peer-to-peer technology, and lets people download programmes the Online News owns the rights to for up to seven days after broadcast. "IPTV enables us to take back that programme to our audience at different times," said Mr Chakkara. "So we can tell our audience that that programme they paid for [via the licence fee], they can access it any time they want." It helps, said Mr Burke, that people are more au fait with terms like "digital", "interactive", now that digital TV reaches more than 56% of UK homes. According to Benoit Joly from broadband telecoms firm Thales, 30% of Europe cannot get satellite TV or digital TV. They could get IPTV though. Analysts say that IPTV will account for 10% of the digital TV market in Europe alone by the end of the decade. What needs to happen now, agree analysts, is for connection speeds to be bumped up to handle the service; 20Mbps connections would be ideal. BT does not see itself as a broadcaster of IPTV services, rather as an "enabler", said Mr Burke. Its strategy is a "hybrid" approach, he explained, where over-the-air conventional broadcasts are supplemented with content over broadband. Initially appealing to niche markets, like sports fans, it will widen out. But IPTV could be used for home-monitoring, "pet cams", localised news services, and local authority TV, too says BT. It even suggests that it could target those households in the UK that do not own a computer, 40% of the country. Broadband to them would not be about data and the net - that could come later for them - but about cheap phone calls and more choice of TV programmes. Home Choice already offers 10,000 hours of shows and channels, delivered over broadband to homes in London. With a broadband net subscription, you can also get your TV and phone service. Through content deals and partnerships, it offers satellite as well as terrestrial channels, and bespoke channels based on what viewers pick and choose from its catalogues. It aims to expand nationally, but is seeing a lot of success with what it offers its 15,000 subscribers now, and aims to double uptake as well as reach by the summer. Although still at a very early stage, IPTV is another application for broadband that underlines its growing prominence as a backbone network - another utility like electricity. Return to results
But employment subindex falls, suggesting expansion is barely generating employment growth But employment subindex falls, suggesting expansion is barely generating employment growth US manufacturing output grew at its fastest pace in nine months, new data showed. Photographer: Scott Eells/Online News US manufacturing rebounded this month after hitting a one-year low in October and output grew at its fastest pace in nine months, an industry report showed today. The overall pace of improvement in the goods-producing sector remained modest, though, and hiring in November slowed. Financial data firm Markit said its âflash,â or preliminary, U.S. Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index rose to 54.3, an eight-month high, from 51.8 in October. Novemberâs reading comfortably beat economistsâ estimate of 52.4. Output grew at its fastest clip in nine months after nearly flat-lining in October. The subindex jumped to 57.1 from 50.6. Respondents linked the rebound partly to the end of Octoberâs partial government shutdown and a rise in demand from domestic and overseas customers. Recent readings suggest the manufacturing output will grow 0.6 per cent in the fourth quarter and 2.3 per cent for the year, said Markit chief economist Chris Williamson . But the employment subindex fell to 52.2 from 52.7, suggesting that âeven (the current) pace of expansion is barely generating any employment growth,â Mr Williamson said. That, along with persistently low inflation, will likely leave the Federal Reserve in no rush to start scaling back stimulus until sometime in the new year, he added. Markitâs âflashâ reading is based on replies from about 85 per cent of the US manufacturers surveyed. A final reading will be released on the first business day of the following month.

Cabs collect mountain of mobiles Cabs collect mountain of mobiles Gadgets are cheaper, smaller and more common than ever. But that just means we are more likely to lose them. In London alone over the past six months more than 63,000 mobile phones have been left in the back of black cabs, according to a survey. That works out at about three phones per cab. Over the same period almost 5,000 laptops and 5,800 PDAs such as Palms and Pocket PCs were left in licensed cabs. Even the great and good are not immune to losing their beloved gadgets. Jemima Khan reportedly left her iPod, phone and purse in a cab and asked for them to be returned to her friend who turned out to be Hugh Grant. As the popularity of portable gadgets has grown, and we trust more of our lives to them, we seem to be forgetting them in ever larger numbers. The numbers of lost laptops has leapt by 71% in the last three years. This has left Londoners, or those travelling by cab in the capital, as the world's best at losing laptops, according to the research by the Licensed Taxi Drivers Association and Pointsec, a mobile-data backup firm. More than twice as many laptops were left in the back of black cabs in London as in any of the nine other cities (Helsinki, Oslo, Munich, Paris, Stockholm, Copenhagen, Chicago and Sydney) where the research into lost and found gadgets was carried out. By contrast Danes were most adept at losing mobile phones being seven times more likely to leave it behind in a cab than travellers in Germans, Norwegians and Swedes. Top of the range phones can carry enormous amounts of data - enough to hold hundreds of pictures or thousands of contact details. Given that few people back up the data on their PC it is a fair bet that even fewer do so with the phone they carry around. You could be losing a fair chunk of your life in the back of that cab not least because many people collect numbers on their phone that they do not have anywhere else. Equally, phones let you navigate through contacts by name so many people have completely forgotten their friends' numbers and could not reconstruct them if they had to. This growing habit of losing gadgets explains the rise of firms such as Retrofone which lets people buy a cheap old-fashioned phone to replace the tiny, shiny expensive one they have just lost. Briton's growing love of phones has also led to the creation of the Mobile Equipment National Database that lets you register the unique ID number of your phone so it can be returned to you in the event of it being lost or stolen. According to statistics 50% of all muggings and snatch theft offences involve mobiles. Millions of gadgets are now logged in the database and organisations such as Transport For London regularly consult it when trying to re-unite folk with their phones and other gadgets. For the drivers, finding a mobile in the back of their cab is one of the more pleasant things many have found. The survey of what else has been left behind included a harp, a dog, a hamster and a baby. Comments are closed for this article.
Call for public health policy on need for elderly to take calcium Call for public health policy on need for elderly to take calcium Dr Miriam Casey of St Jamesâs Hospital: âIf you want to prevent bone fractures, milk is probably the easiest way to approach this.â Photograph: Brenda Fitzsimons / THE IRISH TIMES Just 40 per cent of patients attending the bone fracture clinic in St Jamesâs Hospital drink sufficient milk every day for their bone health, although the need for it is âdrilled into themâ, a consultant geriatrician has said. Dr Miriam Casey has called for a public health policy on the need for elderly people to take enough calcium to prevent osteoporosis. Speaking at the Joint Irish Nutrigenomics Organisation (JINGO) symposium in Dublin last week, Dr Casey said there was a compelling case for a diet-based approach to calcium and Vitamin D intake, as only half of patients who are recommended vitamin supplements actually take them. âBone is made up of collagen into which calcium is deposited, bone is very much dependent what you are eating. If you want to prevent bone fractures, milk is probably the easiest way to approach this.â According to an American study, the cohort of elderly people with the lowest bone density also had the lowest level of milk intake. The lower the bone density, the higher the risk of fracture. She deemed it necessary for elderly people to eat meat twice a day because the animal protein in it helps prevent osteoporosis, but only 2.3 per cent of patients actually take that amount of meat. The Trinity, University of Ulster and Department of Agriculture Study (TUDA) is examining the effect of diet and genetics on the elderly cohort in the population, both north and south. Broken bones in the elderly can be of serious consequence even leading to death. The main complication of osteoporosis is hip fracture and 20 per cent of those who have it will die from complications within the first year. Dr Casey cited a recent study in France , Netherlands and Sweden which illustrated how increasing the intake of dairy products is a very cost-effective way of preventing osteoporosis. The report found that if elderly people can be persuaded to ingest one glass of milk a day, one yoghurt and 30 grams of cheddar, it can make a significant difference in terms of the risk of hip fracture. On an annual basis, it would prevent 2,023 hip fractures in France, 455 in the Netherlands and 132 in Sweden, according to the study. The cost of such provision ranges from a paltry â¬0.44 a day in the Netherlands to â¬0.68 in Sweden. This compares to an average cost to the health service of between â¬114,000 (Sweden) to â¬129,000 in France for the first year after a hip fracture. Return to results
Desailly backs Blues revenge trip Desailly backs Blues revenge trip Marcel Desailly insists there is no chance of history repeating itself when Chelsea take on Barcelona on Wednesday. The French star was part of the Chelsea side crushed 5-1 at the Nou Camp in the Champions League quarter-final second leg in 2000. "Things will be totally different this time," he told Online News Sport. "Now everyone knows about Chelsea and is a little bit afraid of them. They are one of the major clubs in Europe and the pressure will be on Barcelona." Chelsea have not played Barcelona since that quarter-final tie five years ago. The Blues had looked destined to progress after winning the first leg at Stamford Bridge 3-1, courtesy of two goals from Tore Andre Flo and one by Gianfranco Zola. But they collapsed in the second leg, going down to strikes from Rivaldo (2), Luis Figo, Dani and Patrick Kluivert. Former Chelsea captain Desailly, who is now playing for Al-Gharafa in Qatar, says there is no comparison between that side and the current Blues team, who are top of the Premiership. "Mentally they are much stronger, even though a lot of their players are young," the 36-year-old said. "We made some mistakes at the Nou Camp in 2000 - a lot of them were individual mistakes. "It would not happen now. This team has a new motivation and a different mentality." World Cup winner Desailly saw huge changes during his time at Stamford Bridge. He was signed for Â£4.6m from AC Milan in 1998 by Ruud Gullit and went on to play under Gianluca Vialli and Claudio Ranieri. But the biggest change occurred when billionaire Roman Abramovich bought the club in 2003. Desailly says the Russian's arrival helped to instil a winning mentality at the club as well as a demand for success. "The whole of Chelsea is different now - the chairman, the manager and all the players," he said. "Everything is new and there is a huge determination to win. "Since that game in 2000, Chelsea have gained more experience in Europe and were very close to reaching the Champions League final last season." Desailly is one of the most decorated players in the history of football. He won the 1998 World Cup and 2000 European Championship with France, the Champions League in 1993 with Marseilles and 1994 with AC Milan, two Serie A titles and the FA Cup in 2000 with Chelsea. He is now winding down his career in Qatar, alongside the likes of Frank Lebeouf, Josep Guardiola, Titi Camara, Gabriel Batistuta and Christophe Dugarry. So he is full of admiration for two of his colleagues from the great Milan side of the mid-90s who are likely to line up against Manchester United on Wednesday - Paolo Maldini and Alessandro Costacurta. "I'm happy that they have managed to play so long at a high level," he said. "I made a vow to Costacurta that as long as he plays, I will continue to play. "And it's amazing that Paolo has managed to play at such a high level for such a long time." Comments are closed for this article.
Doctors have warned against the over-use of antibiotics. Doctors have warned against the over-use of antibiotics. Photograph: Brenda Fitzsimons/The Online News A casual attitude to antibiotics is damaging their effectiveness and we seeing an alarming global rise in so-called âsuperbugsâ, doctors in Ireland have warned. Consultant microbiologist Dr Fidelma Fitzpatrick, HSE/RCPI clinical lead, said there was a rise in drug-resistant bacteria that cause pneumonia and meningitis, MRSA and E.coli. Misuse of antibiotics threatened to undermine the progress made in medicine over recent decades. Their overuse also made patients less likely to respond to treatment. Launching the action on antibiotics campaign to mark European Antibiotic Awareness Day, Dr Fitzpatrick said: âTaking antibiotics when they arenât needed means that they might not work when you really need them for a serious infection. âThat is why the action on antibiotics campaign - supported by the Department of Health , Health Service Executive , Irish College of General Practitioners (ICGP), Irish Pharmacy Union , Royal College of Physicians and Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland - is aiming to raise public awareness on the correct use of antibiotics and to preserve this precious resource for the use of future generations.â She said antibiotics had âutterly transformed modern medicineâ. âBefore antibiotics were available, common injuries such as cuts and scratches that became infected could result in death or serious illness because there was no treatment available. âThankfully, this does not happen anymore as we have antibiotics available to treat these infections. However antibiotics must be used appropriately and by misusing them we face the risk of returning to the pre-antibiotic era.â Clinicians warned that antibiotics should be used only as prescribed and only when needed. They would not work for colds or flu. In addition, patients should always finish a prescribed course of antibiotics â even if they felt a lot better. President of the ICGP, Dr Seamus Cryan said that the organisation had been actively encouraging lower usage rates for a number of years across its membership. Leaflets and posters are being circulated to all GPs and pharmacies nationwide to promote the campaign. Comments are closed for this article.
EA to take on film and TV giants EA to take on film and TV giants Video game giant Electronic Arts (EA) says it wants to become the biggest entertainment firm in the world. The US firm says it wants to compete with companies such as Disney and will only achieve this by making games appeal to mainstream audiences. EA publishes blockbuster titles such as Fifa and John Madden, as well as video game versions of movies such as Harry Potter and the James Bond films. Its revenues were $3bn (Â£1.65bn) in 2004, which EA hoped to double by 2009. EA is the biggest games publisher in the world and in 2004 had 27 titles which sold in excess of one million copies each. Nine of the 20 biggest-selling games in the UK last year were published by EA. Gerhard Florin, EA's managing director for European publishing, said: "Doubling our industry in five years is not rocket science." He said it would take many years before EA could challenge Disney - which in 2004 reported revenues of $30bn (Â£16bn) - but it remained a goal for the company. "We will be able to bring more people into gaming because games will be more emotional." Mr Florin predicted that the next round of games console would give developers enough power to create real emotion. "It's the subtleties, the eyes, the mouth - 5,000 polygons doesn't really sell the emotion. "With PS3 and Xbox 2, we can go on the main character with 30,000 to 50,000 polygons," he said. "With that increased firepower, the Finding Nemo video game looks just like the movie, but it will be interactive." Mr Florin said that more than 50% of all EA's games were sold to adults and played by adults, but the perception remained that the video game industry was for children. "Our goal is to bring games to the masses which bring out emotions." EA said the video game industry was now bigger than the music industry. "Nobody queues for music anymore." "You can't ignore an industry when people queue to buy a game at midnight because they are so desperate to play it," he said, referring to demand for titles for such as Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas and Halo 2. Jan Bolz, EA's vice president of sales and marketing in Europe, said the firm was working to give video games a more central role in popular culture. He said the company was in advanced stages of discussions over a reality TV show in which viewers could control the actions of the characters as in its popular game The Sims. "One idea could be that you're controlling a family, telling them when to go to the kitchen and when to go to the bedroom, and with this mechanism you have gamers all over the world 'playing the show'," said Mr Bolz. He also said EA was planning an international awards show "similar to the Oscars and the Grammys" which would combine video games, music and movies. Mr Bolz said video games firm had to work more closely with celebrities. "People will want to play video games if their heroes like Robbie Williams or Christina Aguilera are in them." Mr Florin said the challenge was to keep people playing in their 30s, 40s and 50s. "There's an indication that a 30 year old comes home from work and still wants to play games. "If that's true, that's a big challenge for TV broadcasters - because watching TV is the biggest pastime at present." Return to results
Euro zone recovery comes to near halt Euro zone recovery comes to near halt Pace of euro zone recovery slows more than expected as French economy shrinks The â¬9.5 trillion euro zone economy pulled out of its longest recession in the previous quarter, but record high unemployment, lack of consumer and market confidence continue to choke a more solid rebound. Photograph: Mal Langsdon/Online News The euro zone economy all but stagnated in the third quarter with Franceâs recovery fizzling out and slower expansion in Germany. The â¬9.5 trillion economy pulled out of its longest recession in the previous quarter, but record high unemployment, lack of consumer and market confidence continue to choke a more solid rebound. In the three months to September, the combined economy of the 17 countries sharing the euro grew by a slower than expected 0.1 per cent. In the previous quarter it rose 0.3 per cent - the first expansion in 18 months. The euro fell to a session low in reaction to todayâs news. The French economy contracted by 0.1 per cent, snuffing out signs of revival from robust growth in the previous three months. It had been expected to post quarterly growth of 0.1 per cent and has now shrunk in three of the last four quarters. German growth slowed to 0.3 per cent, from a robust 0.7 in the second quarter, but Europeâs largest economy clearly remains in much better shape and its performance matched forecasts. France is becoming a focus for concern within the currency area. The Bank of France predicts the economy will expand by 0.4 per cent in the last quarter of the year but the governmentâs labour and pension reforms are widely viewed as too timid. âIt was particularly disappointing to see France suffer a renewed dip of 0.1 per cent quarter-on-quarter in GDP which highlights concern about its underlying competitiveness,â Howard Archer, an economist with IHS Global Insight, said. A report on French competitiveness by the Paris-based Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development warned that it is falling behind southern European countries that have cut labour costs and become leaner and meaner. âTo reduce the economic lag and lost time, France needs to keep up structural reforms,â OECD chief Angel Gurria said. The report will be hard for the government to ignore since it was commissioned by president Francois Hollande . German growth was fuelled by domestic demand. Exports faltered, another indication of the malaise gripping the rest of the euro zone. âPositive impulses came exclusively from inside Germany,â said the German Statistics Office. The European Commission forecasts the currency area will shrink by 0.4 per cent over 2013 as a whole before growing by a modest 1.1 per cent in 2014. It sees expansion accelerating to 1.7 per cent in 2015. However, with unemployment in the region running above 12 per cent and one in two young people out of work in Greece and Spain, talk of recovery rings hollow. Compounding the French gloom, private sector payroll data showed some 17,000 jobs were destroyed in the third quarter, while inflation slowed in October to 0.7 per cent, the weakest level in four years, when France was emerging from a deep recession. Italy matched Franceâs performance, shrinking by 0.1 per cent. The Netherlands eked out 0.1 per cent growth. A senior Italian official told Online News this week that the euro zoneâs third largest economy would return to growth in the last three months of the year, expanding by as much as 0.5 per cent and ending nine quarters of slippage. The government is forecasting growth of 1.1 per cent next year but most analysts are less upbeat. The median forecast of economists polled by Online News pointed to 2014 growth of just 0.5 per cent. Spain reported last month that it had pulled clear of recession in the third quarter, albeit with quarterly growth of just 0.1 per cent, putting an end to a recession stretching back to early 2011. Portugal is still struggling with austerity as part of its bailout plan yet managed to grow by 0.2 per cent in the third quarter following stunning 1.1 percent expansion in the seocnd quarter. Unlike other embattled euro zone states, unemployment has started to fall there too. Doubts about an unsteady Italian coalition governmentâs ability to push through economic reforms remain a major concern for the euro zone, but France is climbing the worry list fast. Both Spain and Portugal have had the outlook on their credit ratings raised to stable in recent days while Standard & Poorâs cut Franceâs rating to AA from AA+, still well above its Iberian neighbours but narrowing the gap.

Exercise may be more effective treatment than drugs Exercise may be more effective treatment than drugs Review of trials shows being active just as good as medicine in many common conditions Hitting the road could be as effective as popping the pills according to new BMJ research. Photograph: Thinkstock Exercise may be just as effective as drugs at treating common diseases, according to a large study. The research, on more than 339,000 people, found being active was just as good as medicine for those with existing heart disease and in the prevention of diabetes. It also appeared to be a more effective treatment than drugs for people who had suffered a stroke. Experts at the London School of Economics, Harvard Medical School and Stanford University School of Medicine in the United States examined the findings of 305 trials on four conditions: pre-diabetes, heart disease, stroke and heart failure. Of the studies, 57 looked specifically at the effect of exercise and included 14,716 people. More than 200 trials examined drug treatment for the conditions, such as the effects of statins, beta blockers and antiplatelet therapy on preventing significant illness in those with heart disease. The results showed that exercise was just as effective as drugs in treating people with heart disease and whose blood sugar control suggested they were at high risk of diabetes. The results on heart failure were more unclear, with diuretic drugs being found to be more effective than exercise and all other types of drug treatment. The findings were most impressive for stroke, with exercise found to be more beneficial than drug treatment. Writing online in the British Medical Journal (BMJ), the team concluded: âOur analysis suggests that exercise potentially had similar effectiveness to drug interventions with two exceptions. âIn the case of stroke rehabilitation, exercise seemed to be more effective than drug interventions. In heart failure, diuretics outperformed all comparators, including exercise.â The experts said their findings suggest âexercise interventions should therefore be considered as a viable alternative to, or alongside, drug therapy. âIndeed, an increasing number of experts recommend prescribing an âexercise pillâ as a preventive strategy to reduce morbidity and mortality.â Drug regulators should also consider forcing pharmaceutical companies to compare drugs with exercise rather than just a placebo. âIn cases where drug options provide only modest benefit, patients deserve to understand the relative impact that physical activity might have on their condition,â they added. The team said in Britain only 14 per cent of adults exercise regularly at a time when prescription drug use has risen sharply. An average of 17.7 prescriptions for every person were dispensed in England in 2010, compared with 11.2 in 2000. The authors point out that the amount of trial evidence on the mortality benefits of exercise is considerably smaller than that on drugs, and this may have had an impact on their results. Amy Thompson , senior cardiac nurse at the British Heart Foundation , said: âAn active lifestyle brings many health benefits. These researchers suggest doctors should think more about prescribing exercise to ward off heart disease and stroke. âHowever, there is limited evidence comparing the effect of exercise to that of drugs. Further research is needed to contrast the two treatments before we can draw any firm conclusions. âMedicines are an extremely important part of the treatment of many heart conditions and people on prescribed drugs should keep taking their vital meds. âIf you have a heart condition or have been told youâre at high risk of heart disease, talk to your doctor about the role that exercise can play in your treatment.â - Press Association Comments are closed for this article.
Featured: 'Brainwave' cap controls computer 'Brainwave' cap controls computer A team of US researchers has shown that controlling devices with the brain is a step closer. Four people, two of them partly paralysed wheelchair users, successfully moved a computer cursor while wearing a cap with 64 electrodes. Previous research has shown that monkeys can control a computer with electrodes implanted into their brain. The New York team reported their findings in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. "The results show that people can learn to use scalp-recorded electroencephalogram rhythms to control rapid and accurate movement of a cursor in two directions," said Jonathan Wolpaw and Dennis McFarlane. The research team, from New York State Department of Health and State University of New York in Albany, said the research was another step towards people controlling wheelchairs or other electronic devices by thought. The four people faced a large video screen wearing a special cap which, meant no surgery or implantation was needed. Brain activity produces electrical signals that can be read by electrodes. Complex algorithms then translate those signals into instructions to direct the computer. Such brain activity does not require the use of any nerves of muscles, so people with stroke or spinal cord injuries could use the cap effectively. "The impressive non-invasive multidimensional control achieved in the present study suggests that a non-invasive brain control interface could support clinically useful operation of a robotic arm, a motorised wheelchair or a neuroprosthesis," said the researchers. The four volunteers also showed that they could get better at controlling the cursor the more times they tried. Although the two partially-paralysed people performed better overall, the researchers said this could be because their brains were more used to adapting or that they were simply more motivated. It is not the first time researchers have had this sort of success in brain-control experiments. Some teams have used eye motion and other recording techniques. Earlier this year, a team at the MIT Media Labs Europe demonstrated a wireless cap which read brain waves to control a computer character. Return to results
Federal Reserve could cut interest it pays on banksâ reserves Federal Reserve could cut interest it pays on banksâ reserves Central bank offered no hints on when it could âtaperâ its quantitative easing Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke said rates were likely to stay low âfor a considerable time after the asset purchases end.â Photograph: Andrew Harrer/Online News The US Federal Reserve could cut the interest it pays to banks on their reserves in a dramatic move to offset an eventual slowing of its $85 billion-a-month asset purchases. The central bank offered no hints on when it could âtaperâ its quantitative easing, reiterating that it might make the move âin coming monthsâ. But the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committeeâs discussion of alternatives suggests it is keen to slow its buying. Cutting the extra interest on reserves that banks hold with the Fed would drive down already-low overnight interest rates further, probably to a few basis points, hurting bank profits but adding extra stimulus to the economy. According to the minutes of its October meeting, most FOMC officials thought such a move âcould be worth considering at some stageâ as a way to signal continued easy monetary policy after they start to slow asset purchases. The Fed had an extensive discussion of policy plans at the meeting, indicating it is keen to taper the asset purchases that have driven global financial markets for the last year, but also that it wants to offset reduced purchases with a new form of easing. The option that won the most obvious support was a cut in the 25 basis points of interest that the Fed pays to banks on the $2.5 trillion in reserves they have accumulated as a result of its asset buying programme. Another possibility was to add language to the Fedâs statement to describe what would trigger a rise in interest rates. It could also say that rates are likely to rise only slowly when they do eventually take off. Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke used such language in a speech on Tuesday. He said rates were likely to stay low âfor a considerable time after the asset purchases endâ. The minutes show Federal Reserve officials still expect to âtrimâ their asset buying in the coming months as a result of improvement in the labour market. But they also considered scenarios where they would lower purchases before âan unambiguous further improvement in the outlook was apparentâ. â
Ferguson fears Milan cutting edge Ferguson fears Milan cutting edge Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson said his side's task against AC Milan would not be made any easier by the absence of Andriy Shevchenko. Milan's talismanic European footballer of the year misses Wednesday's Champions League first-leg tie after fracturing his cheekbone. "It's a loss (to Milan), but it could be worse if they didn't have such quality to bring in," Ferguson said. "How much they miss him I think they'll know tomorrow night." Ferguson said Milan's front line would still represent a formidable challenge for his defenders. "They can play Rui Costa and play Kaka forward. They can bring Serginho in and they can play (Jon Dahl) Tomasson," he said. Ferguson's own goalscoring talisman Ruud van Nistelrooy is fit again, but the Scot admitted he was unsure whether to start the Dutchman, who has not played for three months. "Ruud is the best striker in Europe. What I have to judge is whether he will struggle with the early pace after being out for so long," he said. "His ability puts him in with a big shout but it is a major decision." Ferguson, though, is confident his young players, particularly Wayne Rooney and Cristiano Ronaldo, are up to the task. "We have an opportunity to win this cup this year, no question about that," he declared. "With the maturity we see every week in Ronaldo and Rooney, the return of Van Nistelrooy and the form of Roy Keane, Paul Scholes and Ryan Giggs, we must have a fantastic chance." It is a view shared by Rooney, who believes "if we can get past Milan, we have a great chance". "As soon as I knew we were playing Milan, I got excited. Looking at the draw, it is anyone's trophy but we have every chance. "Hopefully, we can get to that final in Turkey and bring the cup back to Manchester." Milan coach Carlo Ancelotti said his team were looking forward to returning to the venue where they lifted Europe's most prestigious club title two seasons ago. Milan beat Juventus in a penalty shootout after a 0-0 tie at Old Trafford and Ancelotti said: "We are all very happy to return (to Old Trafford) to play in the Champions League and this will give us great motivation." Ancelotti said he was aware of the threat United posed to his hopes of Champions League glory. "It's fundamental that we don't allow them to take control of the game. Our intention is not to adapt to their play but to play our game," he said. "They have great quality in attack, they use the wings a lot and we will have to make sure we stop them." Return to results
File-swappers ready new network File-swappers ready new network Legal attacks on websites that help people swap pirated films have forced the development of a system that could be harder to shut down. One site behind the success of the BitTorrent file-swapping system is producing its own software that avoids the pitfalls of the earlier program. A test version of the new Exeem program will be released in late January. But doubts remain about the new networks ability to ensure files being swapped are "quality copies". In late December movie studios launched a legal campaign against websites that helped people swap pirated movies using the BitTorrent network. The legal campaign worked because of the way that BitTorrent is organised. That file-sharing system relies on links called "trackers" that point users to others happy to share the file they are looking for. Shutting down sites that listed trackers crippled the BitTorrent network. One of the sites shut down by the legal campaign was suprnova.org which helped boost the popularity of the BitTorrent system by checking that trackers led to the movies or TV programmes they claimed to. Now the man behind suprnova.org, who goes by the nickname Sloncek, is preparing to release software for a new file-swapping network dubbed Exeem. In an interview with Novastream web radio, Sloncek said Exeem would combine ideas from the BitTorrent and Kazaa file-sharing systems. Like BitTorrent, Exeem will have trackers that help point people toward the file they want. Like Kazaa these trackers will be held by everyone. There will be no centrally maintained list. This, said Sloncek, should make the system less vulnerable to legal action aimed at stopping people swapping pirated movies and music. The Exeem software has been under development for a few months and is currently being tested by a closed group of users. An early public version of the software should be available before February. Sloncek said that currently only a Windows version of the software was in development. There were no plans for a Linux or Mac version. He said that costs of writing the software will be paid for by adverts appearing in the finished version of the program. Despite Suprnova administrator Sloncek's involvement with Exeem, the basic technology appears to have been developed by a firm called Swarm Systems that is based on Caribbean island Saint Kitts and Nevis. Users of the Exeem system will be able to rate files being swapped to help stop the spread of fake files, Sloncek told Novastream. Dr Johan Pouwelse, a researcher at the Delft University of Technology who studies peer-to-peer networks, said Exeem was the next evolution in file-sharing systems. But, he said, it would struggle to be as popular as BitTorrent and Suprnova because early versions were not taking enough care to make sure good copies of files were being shared. "Exeem cannot prevent pollution," he said. "The rating system in Exeem seems flawed because it is easy to insert both fake files and fake ratings," he said. Studies have shown that organisations working for record labels and movie studios have worked to undermine Kazaa by putting in fakes. By contrast moderators on Suprnova made sure files being shared were high quality. "The moderators are the difference between having a system that works and one that's full of crap like Kazaa," he said. "There is a fundamental tension between distribution and integrity," he said. Mr Pouwelse said that future versions of file-sharing systems are likely to incorporate some kind of distributed reputation system that lets moderators prove who they are to the network and rate which files are worth downloading. When big files were being shared moderation systems were key, said Mr Pouwelse. He added that the legal attacks on BitTorrent had driven people away from sites such as Suprnova but many users had simply migrated to other tracker listing sites many of which have seen huge increases in traffic. "It's hard to compete with free," he said. No-one from the Motion Picture Association of America was immediately available for comment on the file-sharing development. Return to results
Fiscal consolidation must continue, IMF says Fiscal consolidation must continue, IMF says IMF mission chief says Ireland is a good example of how to transition out of a bailout programme The head of the International Monetary Fundâs mission to Ireland said today that the country could be held up as a good example of how to transition out of a bailout programme but cautioned that âthe Government will need to continue (with) its fiscal consolidation in the next few yearsâ. Craig Beaumont, the IMFâs mission chief to Ireland, said its preference would be for a continued broadening of the tax base rather than higher income taxes, along with a further tightening of spending by the State. He said specific actions were for the Irish Government to decide. Mr Beaumont said unemployment remains too high and further action is required in tackling mortgage arrears and various sector reforms. But he said the Irish economy was showing positive signs of growth. Ireland is due to exit the IMF-EU bailout on December 15th. On whether the IMF supported a precautionary credit line for Ireland when the bailout ends, Mr Beaumont said it was ânot uncommonâ for such an arrangement to be put in place but added that Ireland was in quite a âstrong positionâ in relation to its bond yields and cash buffers, which are close to â¬25 billion. He said it was âup to the Irish authorities to decideâ if a backstop arrangement was required, adding that the IMF would be happy to consider such a request either before the December 15th exit date, or early in the 2014. Mr Beaumont confirmed that the IMF would continue with oversight of Ireland until its loans are fully repaid. IMF officials will visit here every six months and Ireland will have until December 2023 to repay the Washington DC-based bodyâs loans, he added. Return to results
Foreign-born women living in Ireland are 10 times more likely to breastfeed than their Irish counter... Foreign-born women living in Ireland are 10 times more likely to breastfeed than their Irish counterparts, a conference heard yesterday. But the absence of a breast- feeding culture in Ireland is so prevalent that these women are only 2.4 times more likely to breastfeed than their Irish counterparts after living in Ireland for 10 years. Fiona Dunleavy , a senior clinical dietitian in Dublin, told a medical symposium on nutrition in the first 1,000 days of life, that there needed to be a change in culture in Ireland to make breastfeeding the norm rather than a lifestyle choice. She recommended that teenage girls should be taught in school about the benefits of breastfeeding. Ireland has one of the lowest levels of breastfeeding rates in Europe. Initiation rates (women who start off breastfeeding) are at 50 per cent in Ireland in comparison with 80 per cent in the UK. Just 19 per cent of mothers, who have not completed the Leaving Certificate, breastfeed. For women with a degree, that figure rises to 75 per cent. Comments are closed for this article.
France starts digital terrestrial France starts digital terrestrial France has become the last big European country to launch a digital terrestrial TV (DTT) service. Initially, more than a third of the population will be able to receive 14 free-to-air channels. Despite the long wait for a French DTT roll-out, the new platform's backers hope to emulate the success of its UK free-to-air counterpart, Freeview. Recent figures from the UK's regulator Ofcom showed Freeview was more popular than the Sky digital satellite service. In the three months to September 2004, almost five times as many people signed up to the UK's free-to-air DTT service compared with Sky. Almost 60% of UK households have gone digital on at least one television set through cable, satellite or Freeview. The French DTT platform is known as TNT, which stands for TV numerique terrestre or digital terrestrial television. But it is being branded as Television Numerique pour Tous, or "digital television for all". TNT is a joint venture between public broadcaster France Televisions and a handful of cable and satellite operators. Digital terrestrial TV will launch as a free-to-air platform to start with, adding pay-TV channels later. Thirty-five contenders have bid for an additional eight frequencies on top of the 14 already allocated. "A couple of years ago, DTT had a bad image," said Olivier Gerolami, chief operating officer of TNT. "But everyone's impressed with DTT in the UK, Italy and Germany, and they realise it is a very good idea. "France is the poorest market in Europe in terms of free-to-air national channels, so it has the potential to be one of the biggest DTT markets," Mr Gerolami added in remarks quoted by the US entertainment industry paper Variety. TNT aims to reach 35% of France's population at launch, from 17 transmission sites. The transmission area will initially include Paris, Lille, Lyon and Toulouse. Eventually there will be 115 sites reaching over 80% of homes. Digital terrestrial set-top boxes are available from as little as 70 euros (Â£50). A recent survey by Mediametrie found that 70% of people interviewed were aware of DTT, and 25% were planning to buy a digital receiver. Consumer electronics companies such as Nokia, Sagem, Sony and Thomson are gearing up for production. The Conseil Superieur de l'Audiovisuel (CSA), the French broadcasting regulator, said: "Following the recent success of Freeview in the UK, some manufacturers are optimistic about sales prospects". Media analysts believe that initially the majority of viewers will buy inexpensive set-top boxes that are unable to support interactive services. The CSA said the current aim of reaching 85% of the population by 2007 was achievable, but the future of the remaining TV viewers required action by the public sector. For the most part, they are people living in mountainous or border areas, which will remain beyond the reach of digital terrestrial TV for years. Up to 15 pay-TV channels will launch on DTT between September 2005 and March 2006. Leading pay-TV operators Canal Plus and TPS have submitted bids to market bouquets of channels. Free-to-air services will be broadcast in MPEG-2 format. But pay-TV operators will be allowed to broadcast in MPEG-4 - a much better compression technology - which will potentially allow for high-definition (HD) subscription services in the future. TNT expects between 700,000 and one million DTT set-top boxes to be sold in 2005. "It is difficult to tell how quickly it will take off," said Mr Gerolami, "but we're optimistic that it will revolutionise television in France." Other analysts were less optimistic, predicting consumers would now be less likely to sign up for pay-TV subscriptions. "We think free DTT could put brakes on the underlying growth of pay-TV in France," said Henri de Bodinat, vice-president of the Arthur D. Little consultancy. Comments are closed for this article.
Further price increases expected in the months ahead Further price increases expected in the months ahead Subscribers to top-level health insurance plans face increases of about â¬800 on their policies as a result of the Governmentâs controversial decision to reduce tax relief provision in the budget last week. The main health insurance companies are to commence informing subscribers due to renew that previously-advised price levels will be adjusted upwards on foot of the tax relief cut which came into effect immediately after the budget last week. Subscribers The net price which subscribers have to pay for top-level plans will increase by about 20 per cent because of the Government move. This will see plans such as the VHIâs âhealthplus platinumâ (the former Plan E) rise by just under â¬800 for individuals. Other higher-end health insurance plans such as the VHIâs healthplus premium (the former Plan D) will increase by about 18 per cent or by nearly â¬500. The new increases will be in addition to further price hikes expected to be introduced by health insurers in the months ahead. Another Government measure, to charge for all private patients treated in public hospitals, even if not in designated private beds, will almost certainly lead to further subscripton increases after it comes into effect in January. The reduction in tax relief on subscriptions was one of the issues raised by older people at their protest at the DÃ¡il yesterday. Tax relief In the budget last week the Government put in place a cap of â¬1,000 (â¬500 for children) on the level of premiums which attracted tax relief for adults . Up to now tax relief of 20 per cent was available for the full cost of health insurance policies. Overall the introduction of the measure will see prices rise by between 3 per cent and 20 per cent, with the largest subscription hikes applying to the more expensive health insurance plans. The health insurance industry has argued that up to 1.2 million will be affected by the reduction in tax relief. The Department of Finance said the number was 577,000.

GP faces inquiry over patientâs melon-sized abdominal mass GP faces inquiry over patientâs melon-sized abdominal mass Dublin doctor allegedly failed to adequately examine mother-of-one, inquiry heard Dr Tonya Timmons denies the allegations and claims Joanne Kelly did not tell her about the symptoms she later complained of when she went to Beaumont Hospital. Photograph: The Online News A GP who allegedly failed to diagnose a patient with a life-threatening abdominal infection that created a mass the size of a melon is facing allegations of poor professional performance at a Medical Council fitness-to-practise inquiry this morning. Dr Tonya Timmons from Dublin was training at Coolock Health Centre in autumn 2011 when she treated her patient Joanne Kelly over a series of four visits. Allegations against her include that she failed to conduct an adequate examination, failed to make an adequate record of her patientâs symptoms, failed to consider any diagnosis other than nerve problem sciatica and failed to consult with her trainer in relation to her diagnosis. The doctor denies the allegations and claims Ms Kelly did not tell her the symptoms she later complained of when she went to Beaumont Hospital . Ms Kelly, a childcare worker, had four visits with Dr Timmons between August 2nd and October 4th and was diagnosed with a kidney infection and subsequently sciatica. She eventually went to the emergency unit at Beaumont Hospital and was diagnosed with abdominal actinomycosis, a rare bacterial disease that created a mass in her pelvis and required surgery and intravenous antibiotics. Giving evidence, Ms Kelly said at her last two visits to Dr Timmons she complained of symptoms including back pain, difficulty walking, dizziness, nausea, weight loss and blue lips. She was told she had sciatica, was given prescriptions for anti-inflammatory drugs and told she needed more exercise. She was also screened for post-natal depression, having given birth to her first child four months earlier. She said she explained she did get exercise as she had no car and also gave Irish dancing lessons to children. The last consultation, on October 4th, lasted five or 10 minutes, she said. âI remember leaving the consultation and going to a cafe and breaking down in tears,â she said. She went to Beaumont Hospital on October 20th after her symptoms worsened. âEnough was enoughâ, she said. Under cross-examination by Jane OâNeill BL for Dr Timmons, Ms Kelly conceded that the hospital notes taken when she was admitted did not support the timing of her symptoms which she had said she listed for Dr Timmons. Also giving evidence, Dr Samuel McConkey, a specialist in infectious diseases from Beaumont Hospital, said actinomycosis was rare and he had only seen three cases in more than 8 years practising in Ireland. He said the abdominal mass it created was the size of a melon. It was obstructing Ms Kellyâs urethra, the tube which drains fluid from the kidneys. This was âquite a serious problemâ, he said and if left untreated could lead to death. Dr McConkey also told the inquiry the abdominal mass was not palpable on admission to hospital. The case continues. Comments are closed for this article.
Global digital divide 'narrowing' Global digital divide 'narrowing' The "digital divide" between rich and poor nations is narrowing fast, according to a World Bank report. The World Bank questioned a United Nation's campaign to increase usage and access to technology in poorer nations. "People in the developing world are getting more access at an incredible rate - far faster than... in the past," said the report. But a spokesman for the UN's World Summit on the Information Society said the digital divide remained very real. "The digital divide is rapidly closing," the World Bank report said. Half the world's population now has access to a fixed-line telephone, the report said, and 77% to a mobile network. The report's figures surpass a WSIS campaign goal that calls for 50% access to telephones by 2015. The UN hopes that widening access to technology such as mobile phones and the net will help eradicate poverty. "Developing countries are catching up with the rich world in terms of access [to mobile networks]," the report said. "Africa is part of a worldwide trend of rapid rollout... this applies to countries rich and poor, reformed or not, African, Asian, European and Latin American." A spokesman for the World Summit for the Information Society (WSIS), which is meeting this week in Geneva, told the Online News News website: "The digital divide is very much real and needs to be addressed. "Some financing has to be found to help narrow the divide." On Tuesday, a meeting of the WSIS in Geneva agreed to the creation of a Digital Solitary Fund. "The fund is voluntary and will help finance local community-based projects," said the WSIS spokesman. Under the proposals agreed, voluntary contribution of 1% on contracts obtained by private technology service providers could be made to the Digital Solidarity Fund. The exact financing mechanism of the fund is to be ironed out in the coming days, said the WSIS. Sixty percent of resources collected by the fund will be made available for projects in least developed countries, 30% for projects in developing countries, and 10% for projects in developed countries.

Greece defy the odds at Euro 2004 Greece defy the odds at Euro 2004 Greece arrived in Portugal for Euro 2004 as 150-1 outsiders who had never won a match at a major tournament. Four weeks later, manager Otto Rehhagel was a legendary figure in Greece and Angelos Charisteas had written his name into footballing legend. Charisteas scored the winner in the 1-0 final victory that sank hosts Portugal. England's Wayne Rooney may have been the individual star of the tournament, but when it came to the best team, the super-efficient Greeks stole the show. Rehhagel's combination of unsung stars and shrewd tactics proved beyond the bigger names in the tournament. Greece started and finished Euro 2004 by beating Portugal, who improved throughout the competition under former Brazil coach Luiz Felipe Scolari. Favourites France were overcome 1-0 in the quarter-final while form side the Czech Republic were beaten by the same score in the semi-final. For England, another major tournament only brought more frustration. England opened against France in the Stadium of Light, and looked to be on the way to victory thanks to Frank Lampard's first-half goal. But captain David Beckham missed a penalty and with it went England's hopes of victory. Zinedine Zidane hit a last-minute equaliser from a free-kick then scored a dramatic winner. He converted from the spot after David James brought down Thierry Henry after he intercepted Steven Gerrard's pass. Enter Rooney, with two goals in the 3-0 win against Switzerland, a feat he repeated in the 4-2 win against Croatia that sealed a quarter-final place. Sadly for England, Rooney broke his foot shortly after Michael Owen had put them ahead against Portugal. Helder Postiga equalised, but England were cursing when a last-minute header by Sol Campbell was disallowed. Rui Costa put Portugal ahead, but Frank Lampard struck his third goal of the tournament to send it to penalties. Beckham's penalty miss proved crucial and when Darius Vassell also missed, Portugal keeper Ricardo sealed the win. Another man with Premiership links, Liverpool's Milan Baros, was the leading scorer with five goals in the tournament in an excellent Czech side. The Czechs were involved in the best game, coming from two goals down to beat Holland 3-2. Germany were one of the major disappointments, with Rudi Voeller's side failing to reach the last eight. A 2-1 defeat against the Czechs sent Germany out and ended Voeller's reign. And Holland coach Dick Advocaat, who took the blame of a nation after the shock defeat against the Czech Republic, also left his job. The Dutch lost 2-1 to Portugal in the semi-final and that was enough to prompt a change in the Dutch hierarchy. Spain once again failed to produce, missing out on the last eight after they lost 1-0 to great rivals Portugal in the hostile Alvalade Stadium. Italy were another major team that failed to reach the last eight, going amid wild claims of collusion between Denmark and Sweden in their 2-2 draw. But Greece gave Euro 2004 a gloriously unpredictable chapter in football's history, and were deserving winners. It was a tournament played out in good spirit and had perfect hosts in the Portuguese crowds who packed grounds. Their gracious behaviour towards the winners, even after losing the final, gave Euro 2004 a fitting finale. Comments are closed for this article.
HSE homecare package âfalling apartâ, say parents of tracheostomy twins HSE homecare package âfalling apartâ, say parents of tracheostomy twins Kildare couple fear they will have to bring baby boys back to hospital Dermot and Denise Guihan with Shay and Finn: âI cannot begin to describe the level of stress and despair we constantly feel,â says Denise. Photograph: Cyril Byrne A Co Kildare couple whose 25-month-old twin sons had tracheostomies in 2011 and came home from hospital last July, fear they will have to bring them back to hospital as the homecare package sanctioned by the HSE is âfalling apartâ, they say. When Dermot and Denise Guihan from Leixlip brought Shay and Finn home from Temple Street childrenâs hospital, they were âover the moonâ. The two boys have a rare disorder, Pfeiffer syndrome, which is characterised by a premature fusion of parts of the skull, meaning it cannot grow properly. They have had 22 operations between them, including tracheostomies to enable them to breathe. They need 24-hour specialist care. If their tracheostomy tubes become blocked they must be suctioned or they will stop breathing. The homecare package includes day and night nursing. A staggered discharge was planned with agency nurses to provide care. From the beginning the Guihans say they have had problems, with nurses turning up late without apology and sometimes not turning up at all. Complained âIn the second and third weeks after the boys got home there were two no-shows. There are times weâd get a call from the agency saying they had no nurse for the following day. When we complained, theyâd just say, âSorry, weâre doing our bestâ or, âWe canât guarantee thereâll be a nurse availableâ,â says Denise. They say that when they complained to the HSE they were told: âThatâs the nature of agency work. There just doesnât seem to be any consistency and we donât know who is managing the package. We are out of the loop,â says Denise. âI cannot begin to describe the level of stress and despair we constantly feel. We have been under this extreme pressure for two years and every little thing is an ongoing battle.â The two boys are in Laura Lynn childrenâs hospice for respite as Denise has had a baby boy in the past week. They are due home tomorrow morning and the homecare package, as set out until the end of December, has a number of gaps. Nothing is in place after that. âI have just had a C-section, we have a new baby and Dermot is not Superman,â she says. âThe only option they offer us when thereâs no nurse is to bring them back into Temple Street. If things donât change that may be what weâll have to do.â No comment A spokeswoman for the HSE said she could not give detailed comment on an individual familyâs case. âWe are working with the nursing agencies and with the family.â Nurse on Call, one of the agencies involved, said in a statement it was inappropriate to comment in detail on this individual case as overall care services are provided to the family through the HSE. âNurse on Call has received no complaint regarding any of its own nurses being late for work but believes that no nurse ever seeks to be late for work and that nurses are acutely aware of the needs of patients. âNurse on Call appreciates the stress that parents often experience in caring for any child who is ill or suffering and is committed to providing appropriate and diligent care at all times,â it said. A second agency involved with the family had not responded to a request for comment at the time of going to press. Return to results
Health chief says medical card cuts âagainst HSE adviceâ Health chief says medical card cuts âagainst HSE adviceâ Letter to Reilly seen as attempt to deflect blame for proposed cuts from HSE Minister for Health Dr James Reilly. The director general of the HSE Tony OâBrien has told the Government that deep cuts that are to be implemented in spending on medical card services next year are being taken âagainst the advice of the HSE and the Department of Healthâ. The comments are contained in a confidential letter sent Minister for Health James Reilly last Monday that accompanied the HSEâs service plan for 2014. Highly-placed sources said that in the seven-page covering letter, Mr OâBrien maintained that the plan provided for cuts in spending of â¬133 million on medical cards â higher than the â¬113 million in cuts which had previously been suggested. However the tone of the letter has been interpreted by some in Government as Mr OâBrien signalling that he did not agree with the scale of the proposed cuts and that the responsibility for any fallout from the measures would lie elsewhere, other than in the HSE. The HSE has been asked to make overall savings of â¬666 million next year. There has already been considerable controversy this year over medical cards with the opposition claiming that thousands of people have had these withdrawn. The Government has argued that there has been no change in policy on medical cards. In the budget the Government set a target for the HSE to generate savings of â¬113 million on medical cards next year. Elsewhere Mr OâBrien indicated that while the Haddington Road agreement would deliver savings on payroll costs next year, a plan would need to be developed to realise significant amounts of the â¬248 million which the Government had sought to be generated. Pensions The letter has raised eyebrows in some quarters of the Government, where it is considered as an attempt to refight the recent rows over the spending estimates for 2014. The Online News has learned the service plan also proposes that health staff should be excluded from measures agreed by the Government that personnel across the public service who retire before next August can do so with their pensions calculated on the pre-pay cut salaries that applied before the Haddington Road agreement. The plan proposes that HSE management should be permitted to assign a specific date for staff who want to retire rather than having potentially large numbers departing at the same time next summer. The move is aimed at generating savings on the payment of lump sums for retiring personnel. Sources said the HSE also indicated in the plan that it would not be in a position to provide planned follow-up care for women who received faulty breast implants. The Department of Health said a review of the plan was ongoing. Return to results
Health service â¬94m over-budget in year to August Health service â¬94m over-budget in year to August Monthly HSE report shows almost 375,000 adults and children on hospital waiting lists HSE director general Tony Oâ Brien: The health service recorded a deficit of â¬93.7 million for the year to the end of August. The Health Service Executive recorded a deficit of â¬93.7 million for the year to the end of August, according to its latest monthly report. It is now forecasting an end-of-year deficit of â¬105 million on direct services, including a shortfall of â¬75 million on hospital spending and â¬25 million on primary care reimbursement services, including medical cards. However, the overall deficit is likely to be far higher, when account is taken of a failure to make projected savings under the Haddington Road Agreement and the deferment of payments due from private health insurers until next year. Projected savings from fee cuts for doctors and other health professionals are also behind target to the tune of â¬70 million in the first eight months of the year. The HSE has calculated a figure for the projected over deficit by yearâs end, but declined to release it because discussions are ongoing in relation to health insurance and other issues. Some 45,155 adults and children were on waiting lists for elective procedures in August, while a further 7,602 were waiting for gastro-intestinal procedures, the monthâs national performance assurance report states. Some 374,104 people were on the outpatient waiting list, of whom 84,167 were waiting for more than 12 months. Some 2,236 patients are waiting four years or more. At the end of August, 1,863,062 (40.6 per cent of the population) had a medical card and 124,361 (2.71 per cent) had a GP visit card. These numbers include 53,888 with a medical card granted on discretionary grounds and 21,132 with a GP visit card granted on discretionary grounds. The provision of home help hours is running 2.7 per cent behind target, but 4.2 per cent more home care packages have been provided than was planned. .

Henry tipped for Fifa award Henry tipped for Fifa award Fifa president Sepp Blatter hopes Arsenal's Thierry Henry will be named World Player of the Year on Monday. Henry is on the Fifa shortlist with Barcelona's Ronaldinho and newly-crowned European Footballer of the Year, AC Milan's Andriy Shevchenko. Blatter said: "Henry, for me, is the personality on the field. He is the man who can run and organise the game." The winner of the accolade will be named at a glittering ceremony at Zurich's Opera house. The three shortlisted candidates for the women's award are Mia Hamm of the United States, Germany's Birgit Prinz and Brazilian youngster Marta. Hamm, who recently retired - is looking to regain the women's award, which she lost last year to striker Prinz. Fifa has changed the panel of voters for this year's awards. Male and female captains of every national team will be able to vote, as well as their coaches and Fipro - the global organisation for professional players. Comments are closed for this article.
Hitzlsperger waiting on O'Leary Hitzlsperger waiting on O'Leary Aston Villa's Thomas Hitzlsperger is waiting to learn the future of manager David O'Leary before committing himself to a new contract with the club. O'Leary has been in talks over a new deal and he said: "I had a message from Thomas' agent asking me what the news was on myself. "He wants to find out before he goes into discussions over Thomas. "The reason Thomas is not speaking to the club is because the agent wants to see the outcome of what happens to me." Hitzlsperger's current deal expires in the summer and he has been offered a new deal by the Midlands club. The German international is understood to be keen to remain at Villa, despite interest in his native country from Hamburg. But he wants assurances that O'Leary will also be committing himself long-term because negotiations over a new three-and-a-half-year contract appear to have stalled. O'Leary wants his backroom staff - assistant manager Roy Aitken and fitness coach Steve McGregor - to also be given satisfactory deals, which will tie them to Villa until the summer of 2008.

IMO considers invitation to LRC talks in doctorsâ dispute IMO considers invitation to LRC talks in doctorsâ dispute Kenny urges return to negotiating table as 3,000 doctors protest over working hours The Irish Medical Organisation has said it had received an invitation to attend talks at the Labour Relations Commission on the doctorâs strike tomorrow morning. A spokesman said the IMOâs non consultant hospital doctor committee would meet tomorrow to consider whether or not to accept the invitation. Doctors have called on health chiefs to see sense in the long-running dispute over working hours and avoid a second strike. Fifty-one hospitals were hit by a walk-out by 3,000 non-consultant hospital doctors with pickets placed outside at least eight hospitals for most of the day. Eric Young , IMO assistant director of industrial relations, said its members were united, strong and determined to see this campaign through to a successful conclusion. âWe will continue to try and minimise the impact of this dispute on patients but we must continue the campaign until the HSE sees sense and brings an end to this sorry chapter of the abuse of NCHDs and patients,â he said. The strike began at 7am and will continue until midnight tonight with hospitals operating at a Sunday standard. Scores of doctors picketed the Mater, Beaumont, St Vincentâs and Connolly hospitals in Dublin and outside the capital in Cork University, Tullamore, Portiuncula and the Mercy in Cork. The doctorsâ strike followed weeks of failed negotiations with the HSE over shifts that run for more than 24 hours. Taoiseach Enda Kenny urged the striking doctors to return to the negotiating table. âI would say the place to sort it out is at the Labour Relations Commission â not across the airwaves. Thatâs a tried and tested forum,â he said. Mr Kenny said the commission can resolve the dispute. âI do hope that this will be responded to in a positive fashion and hopefully can be resolved so that, understanding that we want to get to a point at the end of next year where the working time directive is fully implemented in respect of all the doctors and all the hospitals as should be many years ago,â he said. Doctors carried out any required transplant and dialysis service and the normal weekend palliative care and attended for patients undergoing active chemotherapy and radiotherapy which cannot be deferred. They maintained they had received exceptional support from the public and medical colleagues. Mr Young added: âI think everybody has seen that the responsibility for this sad state of affairs rests with the HSE and there has been huge support for our efforts to bring an end to the routine abuse of NCHDs.â Dr John Donnellan, of the Irish Medical Organisation (IMO), blamed the Health Service Executive (HSE) for the withdrawal of services. âResponsibility for this day of action rests fairly and squarely with the HSE who have abused the position of NCHDs for over a decade,â he said. âThroughout that time they have misled doctors, they have broken promises and commitments and they have ignored their obligations under EU law. âAs a result they are presiding over an unsafe working environment where the health of patients and that of our own NCHD colleagues is routinely put at risk.Today we are saying loud and clear â enough is enough we are not taking this any more.â About 12,000 outpatient appointments were cancelled as a result and about 3,000 operations postponed as a result of the strike.

Income tax figures belie Irish âlow-taxâ myth Income tax figures belie Irish âlow-taxâ myth Self-employed and PAYE workers now pay broadly similar rates of income tax By any standards, including comparing ourselves to our major trading partners and competitors, these tax rates are high and kick in at low levels of income. We are often told that Ireland is a âlow-taxâ country. Tax tables published with the main budget documents provide a revealing insight into the current state of our income tax system. Some pundits complain that high earners, often self-employed, people pay too little tax. For example, SeÃ¡n Healy of Social Justice Ireland recently proposed that high earners be taxed, all in, at 45 per cent of their total income. According to the Government data published yesterday, a single self-employed person on â¬120,000 will be handing over 44.8 per cent of his or her income to the State both this year and next. Married couples at this income level fare slightly better: 41.2 per cent in total income taxes. For the PAYE worker, the numbers are now similar to the self-employed sector: thatâs a mark of the success the authorities have had in limiting tax breaks. At â¬100,000 a year, a single PAYE worker hands over 41 per cent of his income. This rises to 46 per cent as income gets to â¬175,000. By any standards, including comparing ourselves to our major trading partners and competitors, these rates are high and kick in at low levels of income. At the other end of the scale, nearly 40 per cent of workers pay no tax at all. The numbers support other studies from the OECD and ESRI that conclude that the Irish tax system is very progressive, hits high earners very hard and has relatively low (or no) taxes on average incomes. When we add in all of the other taxes, high earners are potentially handing over 60 per cent or more of their income to the tax man. Thatâs an average, all-in, rate of tax, not a marginal rate. This raises a number of interesting questions. Anyone who thinks taxes should be raised needs to explain what definitions of equity and fairness they are using and why higher taxes could improve our economic circumstances.

Intel unveils laser breakthrough Intel unveils laser breakthrough Intel has said it has found a way to put a silicon-based laser on a chip, raising hopes of much faster networks. Scientists at Intel have overcome a fundamental problem that before now has prevented silicon being used to generate and amplify laser light. The breakthrough should make it easier to interconnect data networks with the chips that process the information. The Intel researchers said products exploiting the breakthrough should appear by the end of the decade. "We've overcome a fundamental limit," said Dr Mario Paniccia, director of Intel's photonics technology lab. Writing in the journal Nature, Dr Paniccia - and colleagues Haisheng Rong, Richard Jones, Ansheng Liu, Oded Cohen, Dani Hak and Alexander Fang - show how they have made a continuous laser from the same material used to make computer processors. Currently, says Dr Paniccia, telecommunications equipment that amplifies the laser light that travels down fibre optic cables is very expensive because of the exotic materials, such as gallium arsenide, used to make it. Telecommunications firms and chip makers would prefer to use silicon for these light-moving elements because it is cheap and many of the problems of using it in high-volume manufacturing have been solved. "We're trying to take our silicon competency in manufacturing and apply it to new areas," said Dr Paniccia. While work has been done to make some of the components that can move light around, before now silicon has not successfully been used to generate or amplify the laser light pulses used to send data over long distances. This is despite the fact that silicon is a much better amplifier of light pulses than the form of the material used in fibre optic cables. This improved amplification is due to the crystalline structure of the silicon used to make computer chips. Dr Paniccia said that the structure of silicon meant that when laser light passed through it, some colliding photons rip electrons off the atoms within the material. "It creates a cloud of electrons sitting in the silicon and that absorbs all the light," he said. But the Intel researchers have found a way to suck away these errant electrons and turn silicon into a material that can both generate and amplify laser light. Even better, the laser light produced in this way can, with the help of easy-to-make filters, be tuned across a very wide range of frequencies. Semi-conductor lasers made before now have only produced light in a narrow frequency ranges. The result could be the close integration of the fibre optic cables that carry data as light with the computer chips that process it. Dr Paniccia said the work was the one of several steps needed if silicon was to be used to make components that could carry and process light in the form of data pulses. "It's a technical validation that it can work," he said. Return to results
Investors move on from Irish bonds Investors move on from Irish bonds As yields slide to three-year low global investors say bonds are âexpensiveâ Irelandâs 10-year borrowing costs have tumbled to 3.54 per cent from a euro-era high of more than 14 per cent in July 2011. REUTERS/Jose Manuel Ribeiro Irelandâs longest bond rally since 2005 is making the securities too expensive for some investors just as the country looks to exit its bail-out programme. The extra yield, or spread, over German bunds slid to a three-year low this month as Ireland moved closer to exiting the â¬67.5 billion emergency aid program it took in November 2010. Goldman Sachs and BlueBay Asset Management are among the financial companies judging that the yields are now too low for a country thatâs barely growing and still with a debt load bigger than its economy. âWith the spreads where they are now, we think there are better stories, better places to invest,â said Russel Matthews, a fund manager at BlueBay in London, which oversees $56 billion and has been putting money into Portuguese and Slovenian bonds. âWe are positive on the story, but from a valuation perspective we donât think itâs that exciting.â Irelandâs 10-year borrowing costs tumbled to 3.54 per cent from a euro-era high of more than 14 per cent in July 2011. That compares with 6.71 per cent for Slovenian bonds and 6.18 per cent for Portugal, whose government is aiming to follow Ireland and leave its own bailout program next year. Deutsche Asset and Wealth Management, which oversees $1.24 trillion, reduced its Irish holdings after the rally, Oliver Eichmann, head of euro fixed income at the company in Frankfurt, said. The spread on Irish securities over bunds narrowed to 1.69 percentage points on Octtober 17th, the lowest since April 2010, according to closing-price data compiled by Online News. The rally has also pushed Irish yields below those of Italy and Spain. âWe currently view Irish bonds as expensive,â London- based Goldman Sachs analysts Francesco Garzarelli and Silvia Ardagna wrote in a note to clients last week. âThe market has taken a constructive view on upcoming developmentsâ regarding the nationâs return to bond markets, they wrote. Technical analysis based on how Irish bonds have performed compared with peers supports that view. The 14-day relative strength index for 10-year Irish securities reached 83.9 last week, the most since April. It has been above 70, a level that signals it has climbed too much, for 19 consecutive days. The gauge was above 70 for 10 consecutive days ending May 10th, before the yields climbed more than 50 basis points in the following two months. Online News Return to results
Iranian misses Israel match Iranian misses Israel match Iranian striker Vahid Hashemian will not travel to Israel for Bayern Munich's Champions League match against Maccabi Tel Aviv on Wednesday. The German club said the player had pulled out because of a back injury. Iran refuses to recognise Israel's right to exist and does not allow its citizens to travel to the country. A Bayern spokesman said on Monday that the decision not to take Hashemian to Israel had been motivated only by his physical condition. "He's got back pain and he couldn't train," the spokesman said. "It would have made no sense for him to go." Iran gave judo world champion Arash Miresmaeili a $125,000 reward when he refused to fight an Israeli at the Athens Olympics. The International Judo Federation considered taking action against Miresmaeili but concluded he had been overweight for the fight and could not have taken part. Comments are closed for this article.
Ireland a âprolific source of tax loopholesâ, says transparency watchdog Ireland a âprolific source of tax loopholesâ, says transparency watchdog Swiss top âsecrecy indexâ where, despite criticisms, Ireland is among the better states surveyed A branch of Swiss bank UBS in Zurich. Despite pressure on Swiss banks to disclose fiscal and customer data to the EU and US, the TJN report described the concessions as âlimitedâ. Photograph: Arnd Wiegmann/Online News Claims that Irelandâs effective corporate tax rate is close to the 12.5 per cent headline rate is âfictionâ, according to an international tax lobby group. The Tax Justice Network (TJN) described Ireland in a report yesterday as a âprolific source of tax loopholesâ and, summarising recent writings on its financial sector, described it as a âfinancially captured state . . . where politically networked private insiders effectively write the laws with little or no democratic consultationâ. Claims that the effective and headline tax rates are similar, the report noted, is a âfictional result based on a theoretical âstandard firm with 60 employeesâ and no exportsâ. âEntirely inapplicableâ âIt is entirely inapplicable to transnationals,â it added, citing other studies finding the effective tax rate of between 2.5 and 4.5 per cent. Ireland placed 47th out of 82 jurisdiction in the TJNâS biennial âfinancial secrecy indexâ, topped for the second time by Switzerland and based on analysis of 15 indicators, weighted by a countryâs share of offshore financial services. The indicators counted include banking secrecy and access to information on company accounts and other documents related to companies and trusts. Following Switzerland were Luxembourg, Hong Kong, the Cayman Islands and Singapore. The US, which topped the index in 2009, now occupies sixth place, while Germany is in eighth place. Up to $32 trillion in private wealth is secreted away worldwide, untaxed, according to the Tax Justice Network, a campaigning organisation of economists, journalists and policy analysts. Despite pressure on Swiss banks to disclose fiscal and customer data to the EU and US, the TJN report described the concessions as âlimitedâ. Britain ranked 21st but would have topped the table if it was combined with âsatellite secrecy jurisdictionsâ it partly controls, including Jersey, Guernsey, the Cayman Islands and Bermuda. âThe City of London and its satellites constitute by far the most important part of the offshore world of secrecy jurisdictions,â write the reportâs authors. The report says that Germany operates a tax and fiscal regime allowing the laundering of up to â¬57 billion annually by organised crime networks from Africa, Latin America and even Italyâs Mafia. Germany operates a âworrisomeâ tax regime that does not foresee the automatic exchange of tax information, it added, allowing many foreign-owned assets in Germany to be held through complicated structures spanning Luxembourg and Switzerland. âIt is still obviously home for large volumes of tax evading and other illicit flows and assets from a round the globe,â the report noted. Money laundering The reportâs authors claim Germany is a country of âlax anti-money laundering enforcementâ and singled out Italy as a primary source of illicit capital flows. There are no comprehensive public statistics on money laundering in Germany, the report notes. The biennial TJN research draws on reports by governments and international organisations such as the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development. Comments are closed for this article.
Juninho demand for O'Neill talks Juninho demand for O'Neill talks Juninho's agent has confirmed that the player is hoping for talks with Martin O'Neill as the Brazilian midfielder comes closer to departing Celtic. Brian Hassell says no official approach has been received from Manchester City but that the English club had been earmarked as a possible destination. But it was being stressed to Online News Sport that Juninho would prefer to remain with the Scottish champions. Juninho wants assurances that he will return to O'Neill's first-team plans. He has become frustrated with his lack of first-team action since his move from Middlesbrough in the summer. Hassel says Juninho, who has just bought a new home, would "desperately like to stay at Celtic" but will seek a move if it is made clear that he is not wanted. The agent also stressed that nothing should be read into the 30-year-old's father being in Scotland and talk of a move back to Botafogo in Brazil. Juninho's father was simply in the country to see his son and grandchildren. "I know there is interest from a Brazilian club, but I know Juninho doesn't want to go there," said Hassel. "He wants to stay in Britain. In fact, he wants to stay at Celtic." Hassall made it clear that a move to Manchester City, who are badly in need of a midfield play-maker, was more of a possibility than Botafogo, or Mexican outfit Red Sharks Veracruz, who also expressed an interest. "It was a thought at one stage," he said. "If you are not going to get a game under one manager, you look for another whose style of play suits you. "He is a fan of Kevin Keegan's style of play. It would not be a bad move for him." Juninho had earlier told the Daily Record: "The manager has had a lot of chances to put me in his team but it hasn't happened. "If that is the case then this is the opportunity for me to go. That would be good for the club and good for me. "If I have no part in his plans, there is no point in remaining here waiting for a chance that never comes." The attacking midfielder also claims he has not had the backing of boss Martin O'Neill since his move to Celtic Park. "I can't understand why I am in this situation," he continued. "When a manager brings a new player to the club, he gives that player support." Comments are closed for this article.
Kenyon denies Robben Barca return Kenyon denies Robben Barca return Chelsea chief executive Peter Kenyon has played down reports that Arjen Robben will return for the Champions League match against Barcelona. "He's been responding well to treatment and started running on Friday, but we'll have to wait and see," he told Online News Five Live's Sportsweek. "We're looking to getting him back as soon as possible, but he'll be back when it's right for him and for us. "There's no plans at the moment around the Barcelona game." His comments contradict those of chiropractor Jean Pierre Meersseman who treated the Dutchman after he fractured his foot at the start of February. Robben had been expected to be out for six weeks, but Meersseman hinted that the winger could be fit for the vital Stamford Bridge game on 8 March. "I hope he can be back and I will try to help him make that happen," Meersseman told the Mail on Sunday. "I put everything right with Arjen's foot the last time I saw him 12 days ago. It was an obvious correction and easy to perform. "I know he was pleased with what I did and now that he is running again. I am due to see him one more time again in the next few days." Meersseman is the medical co-ordinator at Italian side AC Milan. Comments are closed for this article.
Latest CSO figures suggest unemployment rate is now 13.3 per cent Latest CSO figures suggest unemployment rate is now 13.3 per cent Minister for Social Protection Joan Burton briefed fellow Cabinet ministers on the latest drop in the Live Register figures yesterday. Photograph: Eric Luke/Online News Irelandâs unemployment rate fell to 13.3 per cent last month, its lowest level in more than three and a half years, in a welcome boost for the Government ahead of the Budget. However, experts warned the figures were being masked by high levels of emigration and the limited periods people are able to sign on. The latest Live Register figures showed the number of people claiming unemployment benefits dropped by 1,800 in September, the 15th successive monthly decline. This brought the overall number of claimants down to 414,300 at the end of September, giving a standardised rate of unemployment of 13.3 per cent, down from 13.4 per cent in August. The unemployment rate, based on the Live Register which includes part-time and seasonal workers as well as those on Jobseekerâs Allowance, has declined steadily since its post-crash peak of 15.1 per cent in February last year. Over the past 12 months, the number on the register has dropped by 20,665. However, the number of long-term claimants - those signing on for more than a year â remains stubbornly high, accounting for 46.2 per cent of the total. In September, the number of long-term claimants was 188,881, down 2 per cent (3,897) on an annual basis. During the year, the number of male long-term claimants decreased by 4.6 per cent, but the number of long-term female claimants rose by 4.2 per cent. Among EU member states, only Slovakia has a higher rate of long-term unemployment than Ireland. Over the past 12 months, the number of under 25s signing on fell by 10.2 per cent (7,515), which some experts tied to the high rate of emigration. On an unadjusted basis, which includes the impact of seasonal factors like the return of college students, the figures showed there was a reduction of 26,610 in the number of people on the register over the year, bringing the total to 408,670. Minister for Social Protection Joan Burton said while the numbers out of work were still far too high, the Government was making âsustained and welcome progressâ. âSince coming to office, I have focused on transforming the department from the passive benefits provider of old to an active, engaged and focused employment service.â She predicted the Live Register would fall beneath 400,000 later this year, for the first time since May 2009. TÃ¡naiste Eamon Gilmore described the figures as very good news, adding âwe need to see it continuedâ. However, the John Stewart of the Irish National Organisation of the Unemployed said: âIf the on-going fall in the register is as a result of unemployed people going back to work then this is a very positive development for those individuals and their families.â âHowever, there are likely to be a number of different factors at play here including the impact of emigration and also people not making the transition from Jobseekers Benefit to the means tested Jobseekers Allowance.â Alan McQuaid of Merrion Stockbrokers said although emigration had clearly been a factor in bringing the unemployment down, the figures were nonetheless âencouragingâ. âSlowly but surely, overall labour market trends are getting better, though it is still likely to be a number of years before the jobless rate is back in single digits,â he added. Mark Fielding of Isme, the Irish Small and Medium Enterprise Association warned that although figures had improved slightly, a reversal in the 9 per cent VAT rate, as proposed by Minister for Finance Michael Noonan, would reverse the employment gains made so far.

Lending to households continues to decline Lending to households continues to decline But deposits showed strength as money held at irish banks rises almost 8 per cent New figures from the Central Bank showed lending to households and businesses continued to decline. Lending to Irish households and companies continued to fall in the year to October, the Central Bank said, but deposits at Irish institutions rose in the same period. The figures showed loans to households fell by 4.2 per cent in the year to October, as home loans continued to decline. Lending for consumption and other purposes, which accounts for around 22 per cent of household lending, was also down, falling by 9.4 per cent in the same period. Non-financial corporations saw their lending fall by 4.7 per cent in October, picking up pace from the 4.5 per cent decline recorded in September. The decline was particularly felt in the medium term loan sector, which was down 13 per cent. Private-sector deposits were 7.6 per cent higher in the year to the end of October, as insurance corporations, pension funds and other financial intermediaries saw an increase of 26.4 per cent in their combined deposit holdings. Household deposits, meanwhile, were down 0.9 per cent. âThe credit data remain the most disappointing as regards Irelandâs recovery story,â Merrion Stockbrokersâ Alan McQuaid said. âThese latest figures show that there is still little real progress being made in terms of advancing loans to households or indeed the SME sector. As a result, this will severely hamper the overall recovery prospects for the housing market and the Irish economy as a whole, and keep the unemployment rate higher than it would otherwise be. Unless this situation is addressed, the economy will continue to grow well below potential for the foreseeable future.â Comments are closed for this article.
Man Utd women's team to be axed Man Utd women's team to be axed Manchester United will scrap their women's team once the current season ends, just three months before the North West hosts the Women's Euro 2005. From next season, the club's commitment to women's football will only stretch as far as coaching up to the age of 16. "Our aim is best served concentrating on youngsters," said club director of communications Philip Townsend. "Our resources are better deployed at the level of school-age children rather than adults." Football Association vice-chairman Ray Kiddell, who heads the FA women's football committee, greeted the news with dismay. "It is very disappointing," he said. "The progress of women's football can be really helped by professional clubs taking women's teams under their umbrella. "It is a blow to the game that a great club like Manchester United will no longer be doing this." Comments are closed for this article.
McClaren targets Champions League McClaren targets Champions League Middlesbrough boss Steve McClaren believes his side can clinch a top-four spot in the Premiership and secure qualification for the Champions League. After their 3-2 win over Manchester City, McClaren said: "We are playing exciting football, it's a magnificent result to keep us in the top five. "But how well we do depends how often we can get our best team out. "Once we got the third goal it should have been four or five but we nearly paid for it in the end." McClaren also praised winger Stewart Downing and strikers Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink and Mark Viduka, who both ended barren runs in front of goal. He added: "If Stewart keeps playing like this Sven-Goran Eriksson has got to pick him. "And the strikers scored great goals, the combination play between them shows they want to play with each other and they are trying." Return to results
Medical Council finds doctor guilty of poor professional performance Medical Council finds doctor guilty of poor professional performance Photograph: Hugh Macknight/PA Wire A GP who failed to diagnose a patient with a life-threatening infection that created a mass the size of a melon in her abdomen was found guilty of poor professional performance at a Medical Council fitness-to-practise inquiry last week. Dr Tonya Timmons from Dublin was training at Coolock Health Centre in autumn 2011 when she treated her patient Joanne Kelly over a series of four visits. She diagnosed Ms Kelly, a childcare worker, with a urinary tract infection and then with sciatica. When her symptoms worsened, Ms Kelly attended the emergency unit at Beaumont Hospital where she was diagnosed with abdominal actinomycosis, a rare bacterial disease that created a mass in her pelvis and required surgery and intravenous antibiotics. Chairman of the inquiry committee Declan Carey said the committee found Dr Timmons had failed to conduct an adequate examination of Ms Kelly during a consultation on September 16, 2011. Aat a consultation on October 4th, the doctor failed to give âadequate considerationâ to any other diagnosis apart from sciatica âin circumstances where that diagnosis was not entirely consistent with the patientâs symptomsâ. She also failed to arrange appropriate investigations to establish the correct diagnosis. The three findings amounted to poor professional performance. The committeeâs report will be referred to the board of the Medical Council who will decide on any sanction to be imposed on the GP. Giving evidence last week, Ms Kelly had said at her last two visits to Dr Timmons she complained of symptoms including back pain, difficulty walking, dizziness, nausea, weight loss and blue lips. She was told she had sciatica, was given prescriptions for anti-inflammatory drugs and told she needed more exercise. She was also screened for post-natal depression, having given birth to her first child four months earlier. Return to results
Medical staff âfailed to actâ as Savitaâs condition worsened Medical staff âfailed to actâ as Savitaâs condition worsened Third and final report into pregnant womanâs death identifies failures in basic patient care The 250-page report from HIQA into the death of Savita Halappanavar in University Hospital Galway last year makes a large number of recommendations on maternity services, both national and specific to the hospital. Photograph: The Online News A new report into the death of Savita Halappanavar has found there was a failure to provide her with the most basic element of patient care and a failure to recognise and act upon signs of her clinical diagnosis in University Hospital Galway last year. The report by the Health Information and Quality Authority points to a number of âmissed opportunitiesâ which, had they been identified and acted upon, could have saved her life. Nationally, it warns that maternity services may, on occasion, not be as safe as they should be, or of sufficient quality. The report says this must be addressed as a matter of urgency and it calls on the HSE and the Department of Health to immediately undertake a review of maternity services. Summary It says the consultant obstetrician, non-consultant hospital doctors and midwives/nurses caring for Ms Halappanavar did not appear to act in a timely way in response to her clinical deterioration and identifies a failure to act or escalate concerns to âan appropriately qualified clinicianâ. Ms Halappanavar, who was 17 weeks pregnant, died in the hospital of sepsis last October 28th following a miscarriage. The Hiqa report says the recommended four-hourly observations of her temperature, heart rate and blood pressure did not appear to have been carried out at the required intervals. It also pointed to a failure to follow up on blood tests for Ms Halappanavar. âThe consultant, NCHDs and midwifery/nursing staff were responsible and accountable for ensuring that Savita Halappanavar received the right care at the right time,â according to the report. âHowever, this did not happen.â It says the most senior clinical decision maker involved in the provision of care to Ms Halappanavar at any given time should have been suitable clinically experienced and competent to interpret clinical findings and act accordingly. âUltimate clinical accountability rested with the consultant obstetrician who was leading Savita Halappanavarâs care.â In addition, the clinical governance arrangements within the hospital failed to recognise that vital hospital policies were not in use, nor were arrangements in place to ensure the provision of basic patient care on St Monicaâs Ward, where Ms Halappanavar was accommodated. The report points out that UHG had developed a local Modified Obstetric Early Warning Score (MOEWS) chart in 2009 but this was not in use on the ward three years later, in October 2012. It says there was no formal clinical escalation protocol and no emergency response team in place at the hospital and while sepsis guidelines were in place, clinical governance arrangements were ânot robust enoughâ to ensure they were adhered to. The report says it is critically important that the health service learns from mistakes, including this tragic event. However, it points out there is a âdisturbing resemblanceâ between the case of Ms Halappanavar and that of Tania McCabe and her son Zach, who died in 2007. There are 34 recommendations in the report, starting with a call for their full implementation. In addition, it says the HSE and the Department of Health must as a priority review maternity services nationally. The 250-page report from the Health Information and Quality Authority is the third report into the death of Ms Halappanavar in University Hospital Galway last year, and follows a coronerâs inquest and an inquiry by the HSE. The long-awaited report was presented to the Hiqa board on Monday evening and a copy was furnished to Minister for Health James Reilly yesterday. Ms Halappanavarâs husband Praveen, who did not cooperate with the inquiry, is also being furnished with a copy of the report through his solicitor. The terms of reference of the Hiqa report were ââto investigate the safety, quality and standards of services provided by the HSE to patients, including pregnant women, at risk of clinical deterioration, including those provided in University Hospital Galway (UHG) and as reflected in, among other things, the care and treatment provided to Savita Halappanavarâ. Dr Reilly again expressed his sincere sympathy to the Halappanavar family for theloss of Savita. âThis tragedy should not have happened. The untimely death of Savita Halappanavar on 28th October last year was a shocking wake-up call to the whole healthcare system about how failures in patientsâ care can sometimes have extreme consequences.â He said:âI am determined that out of the sad loss of this young woman our whole health system will learn lessons that will ensure that it provides safe, patient-centred care.â The Minister also said he would ensure that the report would be given careful consideration and reflection to ensure all of its findings and recommendations are responded to.

Photograph: Brenda Fitzsimons Labre Park in Ballyfermot, Dublin, built in 1967 and the oldest purpose-built Traveller halting-site in the State, is home to 19 families in houses and has space for 24 families in caravans. There are, however, 43 families in caravans, eight of whom have no running water, sanitation or electricity. Seven without basic facilities have young children, including two with special needs. The 35 who do have washing facilities were provided them in small steel outhouses, with toilets, showers and washing machines in late 2011. Dublin City Council says these are âtemporaryâ. The 43 caravans are parked tightly together, not in bays but in a disorganised fashion between cars, bikes, rubbish containers, piles of wood, metal piping and furniture. Children have no designated play areas. It is, says resident Michael Berry (45), a father of seven children between 21 years and 15 months, âheaven compared to what it used to beâ. âBefore we got the outhouse Iâd have to bring the children to McDonaldâs to get a wash.â The family live in an uninsulated van, where two of the children share a bed with his wife, three sleep in beds and two sleep on the floor with him. After heavy rain water comes through the floor of the van. âWhen I take up the mattress in the morning after rain, itâs wet on the bottom.â In a nearby van, his nephew, Thomas Berry , lives with his wife Simone and their three year-old son. They have no toilet, running water or electricity. In another van, Gerry and Mary Devine live in a one-room van, with a two-year-old and six-month old baby. They share facilities with Gerryâs mother Anne, who lives alone in the adjacent van. They would like their own space but have nowhere to go. Gerry has fashioned heating for the two vans with a boiler and stove in a shed he made, with pipes running from it into each of the vans to heat radiators. âOnly for him Iâd be frozen in that van,â says his mother. Several of the outhouses seen by The Online News last week had mildew on the ceiling. One had mushrooms growing in the shower, in another one of the walls was falling apart. Promised units Labre Park has been included in every five-year Traveller Accommodation Programme drawn up by Dublin City Council since 1999. Thirteen new units of accommodation were promised for the site in the first (for the period 1999-2003) and 22 in each of the following two (2004-2008 and 2009-2013). None has been built. This is despite the fact planning permission was granted for new units on the site, and refurbishment, in 2006. Funding was made available in principle by the Department of the Environment in 2008, pending clarification of a number of matters. The council says âantisocialâ behaviour on the site prevented the plan proceeding. This is rejected by Lorraine McMahon, project co-ordinator with Ballyfermot Traveller Action Project. âThis issue was resolved by the end of 2009,â she says. Slabs of demolished houses The council agrees the site is overcrowded, saying new and returning families have come on to the estate and occupied the slabs of demolished houses and other areas that were never designed for accommodation. âThe City Council has applied for funding for the provision of further emergency facilities to facilitate these families and we would hope to have these in place in the near future.â It planned to redevelop the site. âIn the short term we recognise that the families who left other serviced accommodation are currently in need of facilities and are working to have these in place as soon as possible.â Comments are closed for this article.
Momentum of economic growth gaining pace, OECD says Momentum of economic growth gaining pace, OECD says US and Japan leading the way, with euro zone also showing improvements Growth momentum in Germany is firming, the OECD has said, with Italy and France also showing a positive change. Photograph: Toby Melville/PA The momentum of economic growth is continuing to gain pace in most industrialised countries including Ireland, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development said today. The think-tankâs composite leading indicators, designed to anticipate turning points in economic activity, continue to signal strong improvements in growth for the US and Japan , with positive signs also showing for the UK and Canada . Growth momentum in Germany is firming, the OECD said, with Italy and France also showing a positive change. Indicators show growth returning to trend in China , and a âtentative positive change in momentumâ in Russia . Indicators for Brazil and India point to growth below trend rates. Irelandâs indicator has been steadily rising over the past 12 months, from 100.46 in September 2012 to 101.94 in August this year. The euro areaâs indicator has also been gradually increasing, from 99.13 to 100.6 in the same time period, while indicators for the OECD area overall have risen from 99.74 to 100.59.

More women turn to net security More women turn to net security Older people and women are increasingly taking charge of protecting home computers against malicious net attacks, according to a two-year study. The number of women buying programs to protect PCs from virus, spam and spyware attacks rose by 11.2% each year between 2002 and 2004. The study, for net security firm Preventon, shows that security messages are reaching a diversity of surfers. It is thought that 40% of those buying home net security programs are retired. For the last three years, that has gone up by an average of 13.2%. But more retired women (53%) were buying security software than retired men. The research reflects the changing stereotype and demographics of web users, as well as growing awareness of the greater risks that high-speed broadband net connections can pose to surfers. The study predicts that 40% of all home PC net security buyers will be women in 2005. They could even overtake men as the main buyers by 2007, if current rates persist, according to the research. "I think older people have become more vigilant about protecting their PCs as we tend to be more cautious and want an insurance policy in case something does go wrong", said one over-60 woman who took part in the research. "You started off with young male stereotype computer users for last 10 years," Paul Goosens, head of Preventon told the Online News News website. "Now we are seeing real people - both sexes and very often it is women who have more access at home." But net service providers still need to take more responsibility in making sure people are educated about net threats before they go online, particuarly if they are new to broadband, he said. Programs also need to be tailored so that they can be installed by dial-up users with a slower connection too, said Mr Goosens. Security software should be easy to use, with simple interfaces and instructions written in non-technical language, he added. The nature of the security threats are also becoming more than just about e-mail viruses. High-profile complaints about rogue diallers, and spyware or other programs that surreptitiously install themselves on computers, have also raised awareness about the need to have a combination of anti-virus, firewall and spyware-removal programs too. Without protection, these kinds of programs can be picked up just through surfing the web normally. More than 30,000 PCs a day globally are being recruited into networks that spread spam and viruses, a study from security from Symantec showed last year. Viruses written to make headlines by infecting millions are also getting rarer, according to net security experts. Programs are being unleashed to directly profit criminal gangs, many based in Eastern Europe, over those which are designed to show off technical skills or cause nuisance. The research shows that more people are taking these criminal net threats more seriously because, said Mr Goosens, they are reported in the press much more. "You are seeing older users being educated by the media and are seeing them picking up on this threat. They are asking the right questions," he explained. "It is more likely the younger users who naively assume that because they are using a reputable service provider, that they are safe to connect to the net." An unprotected computer on a broadband connection can be breached and infected with viruses or spyware within minutes. By the end of the year it is thought that more than 30% of UK homes will have broadband net access. In July last year, the number of UK households accessing the net via broadband surpassed those using dial-up for the first time, according to the Office of National Statistics. Return to results
Mourinho expects fight to finish Mourinho expects fight to finish Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho expects the Champions League clash with Barcelona to be a fight to the finish. Mourinho is relishing the first leg of the tie against his former club in the last 16 in the Nou Camp. He said: "I wouldn't be surprised if nothing had been decided by the last minute of the return leg and the match had to go into extra time. "I have to defend what is mine and the Champions League is mine at the moment. I'm the last manager to have won it." Mourinho never coached Barcelona, assisting both Sir Bobby Robson and Louis van Gaal. But he is not envious, insisting: "I don't have to be jealous about Barcelona because they have 100 years of history and have won the European Cup once. "I have been managing for five years and I have the same amount of Champions League trophies to my name." Barcelona star Ronaldinho admitted: "I think that it is going to be a difficult match for us because Chelsea have a good team full of big stars. "I have seen Chelsea a few times on television, tactically they are very good and they are very strong on the counter-attack. "They pressure very well and keep possession of the ball so it will be important that we play our own game. "I believe they are the two strongest teams in Europe. Nevertheless, Barcelona are accustomed to playing big games at the Nou Camp, where they have to face the likes of Real Madrid each season. "It is a special game, the atmosphere in the city changes, there are lots of journalists but inside the dressing room there is not a lot of difference," Ronaldinho added. "We are only thinking of winning the match with all respect to the opposition." Comments are closed for this article.
New browser wins over net surfers New browser wins over net surfers The proportion of surfers using Microsoft's Internet Explorer (IE) has dropped to below 90%, say web analysts. Net traffic monitor, OneStat.com, has reported that the open-source browser Firefox 1.0, released on 9 November, seems to be drawing users away from IE. While IE's market share has dropped 5% since May to 88.9%, Mozilla browsers - including Firefox - have grown by 5%. Firefox is made by the Mozilla Foundation which was set up by former browser maker Netscape in 1998. Although there have been other preview versions of Firefox, version 1.0 was the first complete official program. "It seems that people are switching from Microsoft's Internet Explorer to Mozilla's new Firefox browser," said Niels Brinkman, co-founder of Amsterdam-based OneStat.com. Mozilla browsers - including Firefox 1.0 - now have 7.4% of the market share, the figures suggest. Mozilla said that more than five million have downloaded the free software since its official release. Supporters of the open-source software in the US managed to raise $250,000 (Â£133,000) to advertise the release of Firefox 1.0 in The New York Times, and support the Mozilla Foundation. There was a flurry of downloads on its first day of release. The figures echo similar research from net analyst WebSideStory which suggested that IE had 92.9% of users in October compared to 95.5% in June. Microsoft IE has dominated the browser market for some time after taking the crown from Netscape, and its share of users has always stayed at around the 95% mark. Firefox is attractive to many because it is open-source. That means people are free to adapt the software's core code to create other innovative features, like add-ons or extensions to the program. Fewer security holes have also been discovered so far in Firefox than in IE. Paul Randle, Microsoft Windows Client product manager, responded to the figures: "We certainly respect that some customers will choose alternative browsers and that choosing a browser is about more than a handful of features. "Microsoft continues to make significant investments in IE, including Service Pack 2 with advanced security technologies, and continues to encourage a vibrant ecosystem of third party add-ons for Internet Explorer." Firefox wants to capture 10% of the market by the end of 2005. Other browser software, like Opera and Apple's Safari, are also challenging Microsoft's grip on the browser market. Opera is set to release its version 7.60 by the end of the year. OneStat.com compiled the statistical measurements from two million net users in 100 countries. Return to results
New nationalâs childrenâs hospital in Dublin may have âthemeâ New nationalâs childrenâs hospital in Dublin may have âthemeâ Architects interested in tendering for the project are to be asked to suggest themed designs Eilish Hardiman, chief executive of the Childrenâs Hospital Group, said research has shown a fundamental clinical benefit and better outcomes for children who are treated in this environment. Photograph: Eric Luke / The Online News Visits to the national childrenâs hospital in Dublin will take on an entirely different character if proposals to incorporate evidence-based design in the new structure are adopted. Architects interested in tendering for the project are to be asked next week to suggest themed designs similar to those adopted by hospitals in New Zealand , Australia and the US. The proposals will not only have to meet the demanding requirements of a state-of-the-art hospital but will also incorporate design elements not typically associated with medicine. Citing the example of Aucklandâs Starship hospital, Eilish Hardiman , chief executive of the Childrenâs Hospital Group (CHG), said research has shown a fundamental clinical benefit and better outcomes for children who are treated in this environment. âIt is about engaging them, involving them, curiosity, imagination and all of those things. âIt is evidence-based. It has been demonstrated through evidence-based design that if you create this environment the children are healing faster and they have better outcomes. Starship hospital features a rainforest theme while Melbourneâs award-winning Royal Childrenâs Hospital boasts a two-storey coral reef aquarium, installations by Australian artists and a meerkat enclosure managed by Melbourne Zoo. Ms Hardiman was speaking at the launch of a report commissioned by Ombudsman for Children Emily Logan on identifying how child-friendly healthcare and a culture for childrenâs rights can be developed across Ireland . Ms Logan said the complaints received by her office are often not about primary resources. âThey are often about interaction, they are about communication. They are about the experience of perhaps being treated not in a very respectful way or people not understandingâ. She said poor communication can quickly lead to conflict when the substantive issue is in fact âvery small.â The research, undertaken by University College Cork , identifies âbuilding blocksâ such as raising awareness of childrenâs rights in healthcare, developing and implementing standards on the rights of children in healthcare settings and listening to and using the views and experiences of children as the basis for action. The National Healthcare Charter for Children, also published today, identifies ten key principles aimed at ensuring that children receive high quality healthcare that is appropriate and acceptable to them and their families.

Newcastle 2-1 Bolton Newcastle 2-1 Bolton Kieron Dyer smashed home the winner to end Bolton's 10-game unbeaten run. Lee Bowyer put Newcastle ahead when he fed Stephen Carr on the right flank, then sprinted into the area to power home a header from the resultant cross. Wanderers hit back through Stelios Giannakopoulos, who ended a fluid passing move with a well-struck volley. But Dyer had the last word in a game of few chances, pouncing on a loose ball after Alan Shearer's shot was blocked and firing into the top corner. Neither side lacked urgency in the early stages of the game, with plenty of tackles flying in, but opportunities in front of goal were harder to come by. Bolton keeper Jussi Jaaskelainen had to make two saves in quick succession midway through the first-half - keeping out Shearer's low shot and Dyer's close-range header - but that was the only goalmouth action of note. And it was almost out of nothing that the Magpies took the lead on 35 minutes. Bowyer found space with a neat turn on the half-way line and striding forward picked out Carr to his right. He then continued his run and with perfect timing made his way into the box where he met Carr's cross with a downward header into the far corner. Bolton had produced little going forward at this point but they responded well. They were level within six minutes thanks to a smart finish from Giannakopoulos. Jay-Jay Okocha twisted and turned on the edge of the area and after a neat exchange of passes involving Kevin Davies and Gary Speed, the Greek striker found the bottom corner with a first-time strike. The Magpies were opened up again before half-time as Davies set Giannakopoulos in space and Given had to block at his near post. But the home side survived, and they should have re-taken the lead with the first meaningful attack of the second half. Fernando Hierro cynically chopped down Dyer on the edge of the area with the midfielder clean through. But the veteran defender escaped with a booking as there were other defenders nearby, and from the resultant free-kick Laurent Robert curled the ball just wide. Bolton were creating little going forward and they seemed content to frustrate the Magpies. Their strategy seemed to be working until the 69th minute. Alan Shearer's snap-shot was charged down and Dyer reacted first to smash the ball past the despairing Jaaskelainen from six yards. - Bolton boss Sam Allardyce "I am bitterly disappointed with the result, but I am probably more disappointed with the second-half performance. "In the first half we had put them under a lot of pressure, and our goal matched theirs in quality. "I thought it would lift us and that they might be tired after playing a lot of games, but unfortunately we were not up for the battle in the second half. "We allowed them to heap too much pressure on us, and in the end we cracked." - Newcastle boss Graeme Souness "We deserved the win. We had a really good second half. "Bolton are a difficult side to play. You have to match them physically first but we did that, and then we played some football. "We had a slow first 45 minutes when we looked a bit tired but we got going after that. The scoreline flattered them and we could have had one or two more goals."

Old Firm pair handed suspensions Old Firm pair handed suspensions Celtic's Henri Camara and Nacho Novo of Rangers have both been suspended for offences missed by the referee in a recent Old Firm game. Both were given automatic one-match bans and 12 additional disciplinary points for their actions. That means Novo will miss a further two games because of his prior record. Camara will miss one additional game. Novo was found guilty of stamping on Celtic's Stephen Pearson. Camara was punished for kicking Gregory Vignal. "I'm extremely disappointed. I don't know if there's a lot to add to that," said Rangers manager Alex McLeish of Novo's punishment. "But what I will say is that I'm at a loss as to why that incident should be picked up and highlighted when there were so many other incidents during the game." Both players will miss this weekend's games when Celtic host Dundee United and Rangers visit Kilmarnock unless they decide to appeal. The additional bans come into effect from 28 December meaning Camara will also be unavailable for the home game against Livingston while Novo will miss the meetings with Dundee United and Dunfermline. An SFA spokesman said: "They have seven days to appeal but with matches coming along at the weekend they would need to do so before Friday. "But if they do appeal it won't be heard before this weekend because it takes a bit of time to seat up an appeals tribunal." Meanwhile, Bob Malcolm and Rangers have been informed by letter as to the outcome of the hearing regarding his reaction to Rangers being awarded a penalty in the same game. Malcolm, a substitute on the day, was taken from the Rangers dug-out and spoken to by police about an alleged gesture he made. But the SFA would not detail what, if any, punishment Malcolm would receive. "Once Rangers receive our letter we will be in a position to make a comment on the findings," added the spokesman.

Owen delighted with Real display Owen delighted with Real display Michael Owen revelled in his return to the to the Real Madrid starting line-up and inspired a 3-1 win over Real Betis on Wednesday by scoring the first goal. He said: "I am happy I could play a game from the start again. "I felt good all though the game and it is obvious that I am happy to have scored another goal. "People have talked a lot about my performances and I think I have had some months that were not so good and others that were very good." Owen, starting his third successive La Liga match, converted a low cross from Santiago Solari. Robert Carlos made it 2-0 at the break, smashing home an indirect free-kick. Midfielder Edu reduced the deficit after half-time but Ivan Helguera headed past keeper Antonio Doblas to seal victory for his team. Victory took Real to within six points of leaders Barcelona and Owen is confident Real can close the gap. He added: "We had several chances against Betis and I think we can get back in touch with Barcelona. "It is only six points between Barcelona and us and that is nothing. If we can beat them at the Bernabeu (on 10 April), then it will be just three." Owen has scored nine league goals, one behind Real's top scorer Ronaldo. Real had lost their previous two league games.

Podcasts mark rise of DIY radio Podcasts mark rise of DIY radio An Apple iPod or other digital music players can hold anything up to 10,000 songs, which is a lot of space to fill. But more and more iPod owners are filling that space with audio content created by an unpredictable assortment of producers. It is called "podcasting" and its strongest proponent is former MTV host and VJ (video jockey) Adam Curry. Podcasting takes its name from the Apple iPod, although you do not need an iPod to create one or to listen to a podcast. A podcast is basically an internet-based radio show which podcasters create, usually in the comfort of their own home. They need only a microphone, a PC, and some editing software. They then upload their shows to the internet and others can download and listen to them, all for free. Using technology based on XML computer code and RSS - Really Simple Syndication - listeners can subscribe to podcasts collected automatically in a bit of software, which Mr Curry has pioneered. The latest MP3 files of shows can then be picked up by a music playing device automatically. Mr Curry records, hosts, edits and produce a daily, 40 minute podcast called The Daily Source Code. He wants to make podcasting "the Next Big Thing" and says it is an extension of his childhood love of radio gadgetry. "I was always into technologies and wires," he explains. "My parents gave me the Radio Shack 101 project kit, which allows you to build an AM transmitter and subsequently an FM transmitter. "I had my mom drive me around the block, see how far it would reach on the car radio." Mr Curry is American, but he grew up in the Netherlands where he hosted illegal, pirate radio shows in the Dutch capital. He tried university in the US, and ended up back in Holland where he hosted a music video show. He spent the next seven years in New York where he worked at MTV hosting the Top 20 Video Countdown, but spent most of his hours tinkering with this new thing called the internet. "At a certain point in 1995, I was driving in on a Friday afternoon, beautiful blue sky, one of those beautiful days thinking, this is so stupid. "You know, I'm going do the Top 20 Countdown, take the cheque, go home, and sit on the internet until three in the morning. "So, after I finished the show, I quit. I said, on air, it's been great, I've been here for seven years at that point, there's something on the internet, I've got to go find it, and I'll see you later." But Mr Curry's technology and broadcast interests started to gel a couple of years ago when computer storage was growing exponentially and high-speed internet connections were becoming more widely available. The MP3 format also meant that people could create and upload audio more cheaply and efficiently than ever before. Most importantly, Mr Curry says, people across the globe were bored with the radio they were hearing. "Listen to 99% of the radio that you hear today, it's radio voices, and it's fake, it's just fake." He wanted to make it easier for people to find "real voices" on the internet. He wanted software that would automatically download new audio content directly onto players like, iPods. Mr Curry is not a computer programmer, so he asked others to create one for him. No one did, so he tried to write one himself. He finished it a few months ago and says it "totally sucked." He put it up on the net as open source software and now dozens of coders and audio junkies are refining it; the result is a work in progress called "ipodder". Doug Kaye, a California-based podcaster, praises the former MTV VJ for what he has done. "Adam created a simple script that solved what we call the last mile problem. Ipodder takes audio from the web and brings it all the way down to the MP3 player," he explains. "People can wake up in the morning, pick up their iPods as they go to work or before they go exercise, and discover that there's all this new content automatically put onto their players." It is created an explosion in podcasting content and podcasters are springing up in Australia, Finland, Brazil, even Malaysia. One couple broadcasts theirs, The Dawn and Drew Show, from Wisconsin in the US, sometimes even from the comfort of their own bed. Topics range from the comfort of their bed, to the latest films or music and have thousands of listeners. Already, websites are springing up that point listeners in the right direction of good podcasts. Chris McIntyre runs Podcast Alley and says that there are good sites out there but that not everyone has the technological know-how to simply listen. "If I were to tell my mom, or my mother-in-law to copy an XML or RSS file to their podcast aggregator, they would think I was speaking a foreign language," Mr McIntyre says. Along with technical challenges, there may be legal challenges to podcasters who air their favourite, albeit copyrighted, music. Some in podcasting also worry that too much attention may turn what they see as the "anti-radio" into something that is more like conventional broadcasting. Already there is interest in podcasting from the corporate world. Heineken is doing its own podcast now, and so is Playboy. For his part, Adam Curry's pressing ahead with his own vision of what podcasting should be. He loves doing The Daily Source Code because it is about introducing good music and cool ideas to new audiences. He has even been called the Ed Sullivan or Johnny Carson of podcasting which, he says, "is a badge I'll wear with great honour. "To be the Johnny Carson, or Ed Sullivan of anything is wonderful. And you know what? You don't need a hell of a lot of talent. "You just have to be nice, have your ears open, and let people shine. And that's good for me." Clark Boyd is technology correspondent for The World, a Online News World Service and WGBH-Boston co-production. Return to results
Prof Ella Arensman, of the National Suicide Research Foundation, said the findings show that while m... Prof Ella Arensman, of the National Suicide Research Foundation, said the findings show that while many attitudes are more favourable, ongoing awareness about depression and mental health is required. Almost one in three people in Ireland say they would not vote for a politician if they knew they had been depressed, a new study shows. The research indicates that while attitudes towards mental health have become more favourable in recent times, significant numbers still feel harshly disposed towards people with mental health problems. For example, one in five (20 per cent) would not employ someone if they knew that they had been depressed. The findings are contained in a general population survey â Optimising Suicide Prevention Programmes and their Implementation in Europe â to be released later today. The survey was conducted in Ireland, Germany , Portugal and Hungary as part of a European collaborative suicide-prevention project. In Ireland the survey was conducted in Limerick and Galway among a representative sample of 1,000 people in December 2009. While a majority were open to seeking professional help, only half of the people perceived professional help as valuable. Comparing the four countries, Irish people showed the most favourable attitude toward depression, both in terms of personal and perceived stigma. After Portugal, Irish people ranked second-highest in openness to professional help when experiencing emotional problems and ranked highest in rating the value of professional help. Beliefs vs facts Other findings show many people still hold attitudes that are not supported by the majority of medical research. For example, 35 per cent agreed that people with depression are dangerous, while a further 26 per cent felt depression had no real medical evidence. Prof Ella Arensman , of the National Suicide Research Foundation , said the findings show that while many attitudes are more favourable, ongoing awareness about depression and mental health is required. âThe findings on whether respondents would vote for a politician who had depression, or employ someone with a mental health difficulty, are a sign on the wall that much more needs to be done to address stigma,â she said. Airing the issue âFor example, politicians have recently been coming out about issues like depression. I would like to encourage that. When people at senior levels speak openly about these issues, it helps reduce stigma.â Gerry Raleigh , director of the National Office for Suicide Prevention, said the findings were a reminder of how wider society needs to play its part in changing attitudes and providing support. âIt is important that people who are experiencing tough times and are distressed seek help. It is also important that we look out for people around us and support them to ask for help when we are concerned for their wellbeing,â he said. Separately, the Mental Health Commission yesterday called on authorities to invest in specialist mental health services. In a statement to mark World Mental Health Day, the commissionâs chairman, John Saunders , said mental services for older people especially needed more attention. lIf you think you need support experts advise getting an assessment by your GP or mental health professional. Groups such as Aware also provide support for people with depression. Contact 1890 303 302 or visit aware.ie Return to results
Protest over closure of acute mental health unit in Co Galway Protest over closure of acute mental health unit in Co Galway HSE plans to shut â¬2.8 million unit in Ballinasloe despite local opposition Minister of State for Mental Health Kathleen Lynch: A delegation from the locality has sought a meeting with the minister to convey serious public concern over the plans. Photograph: Eric Luke Opposition to HSE plans to close a new â¬2.8 million acute psychiatric unit in east Galway is set to intensify with two demonstrations planned over the coming days. A rally is due to take place in Ballinasloe tomorrow over the proposed closure of the unit, while there will also be a demonstration outside the DÃ¡il next Wednesday. A delegation from the locality has sought a meeting with Minister of State for Mental Health Kathleen Lynch to convey serious public concern over the plans. The Psychiatric Nursesâ Association (PNA) says that the removal of acute beds from St Brigidâs Psychiatric Hospital in Ballinasloe without appropriate community facilities having been put in place first was ânever envisagedâ under the Governmentâs Vision for Change strategy on mental health. Controversial decision Senior mental health service managers in Co Galway have already appealed directly to national director of mental health services Stephen Mulvany to review the controversial decision, which involves referring patients who would use the Ballinasloe unit on to an older unit at Roscommon. The managers told the director in a letter during the summer that they could not understand how a facility which has just been refurbished, at a cost of â¬2.8 million, could be seen as less modern than the unit at the department of psychiatry at Roscommon County Hospital , which was last fully refurbished more than 20 years ago. Roscommonâs hospital has no 24-hour emergency unit, unlike Portiuncula in Ballinasloe, which maintains a close relationship with St Brigidâs. At a public meeting last month, Roscommon Independent TD Denis Naughten described the Ballinasloe unit as âstate of the art â the most modern in the countryâ, and said that the scoring system used by the HSE to arrive at the decision made no sense. âOver the summer mental health patients in Roscommon were being sent to Galway because there was no room for them in Roscommon or in Ballinasloe. This decision to close Ballinasloe is simply crazy,â he said. Cut beds PNA national secretary Noel Giblin said that the HSE was using the Vision for Change strategy to cut beds without having the community supports in place to meet the demand for services. HSE West said that the closure is part of a transition towards community-based alternatives and that there are sufficient resources in Galway and Roscommon to meet the needs of the patients under Vision for Change.

Prutton poised for lengthy FA ban Prutton poised for lengthy FA ban Southampton's David Prutton faces a possible seven-match ban when he goes before the Football Association. The 23-year-old has admitted two charges of improper conduct following his dismissal against Arsenal. The first charge relates to his failure to leave the field promptly, pushing referee Alan Wiley and remonstrating with assistant referee Paul Norman. And the second charge is for using threatening words and/or behaviour to a match official during the 1-1 draw. Paolo di Canio was given a seven-match suspension when he pushed referee Paul Alcock over in a Premiership game between Sheffield Wednesday and Arsenal in 1998. Prutton will be joined at Wednesday's hearing by Saints boss Harry Redknapp, who believes that the FA will throw the book at his player. Redknapp himself sprinted along the touchline to help physio Jim Joyce and coach Denis Rofe shepherd the enraged Prutton away from referee's assistant Norman. "David has made a big mistake and he knows it. I can't condone what he's done. He was out of order but he knows that," said Redknapp. "He's a decent lad. He over-reacted badly for some reason - he had a rush of blood from somewhere. Off the pitch you couldn't meet a nicer lad." Prutton has apologised publicly for his actions and to Arsenal's Robert Pires, who was injured in a wild tackle by the Saints' midfield man. He said: "It's an horrendous situation. I apologise to the ref and linesman, who were only doing their job. "I've also seen what happened to Pires' leg and I'm sorry for that as well." "I apologise for the people who saw it. I know you get lots of kids going to the match now and they don't pay money to see that sort of thing. "It's not a cop-out, but it was all a bit of a blur. Sometimes you react and it's beyond your control, " added Prutton. Comments are closed for this article.
Real will finish abandoned match Real will finish abandoned match Real Madrid and Real Socieded will play the final six minutes of their match, which was abandoned on Sunday because of a bomb scare. The Bernabeu was evacuated with the score at 1-1 and two minutes of normal time remaining in the game. The teams will now play the final two minutes, plus four minutes of injury time, on 5 January. Brazilian Ronaldo and England captain David Beckham had to wait in the street in their kit after the abandonment. Real Sociedad president Jose Luis Astiazaran said: "We thought the best thing was to play the time remaining." Hundreds of fans streamed across the pitch on their way to the exits after the game was called off. Tourists and fans took advantage of the opportunity for a photograph between the famous stadium's goalposts. The two clubs met the Spanish FA on Monday and Astiazaran added: "We thought about giving the game as concluded but after talking with the FA we decided there was no precedent for that and the best thing was to play the time that was remaining." Real Madrid director of sport Emilio Butragueno praised the spectators inside the ground for their conduct. "I'd like to highlight the behaviour of the fans, who showed great maturity and it was an example of good citizenship," he said. Butragueno confirned, before confirming that Tuesday's charity match - which has been billed as "Ronaldo's friends against Zidane's friends" - will go ahead as planned. "I'd also like to take the chance to say that tomorrow's game will take place," Butragueno declared of the "Partido contra la Pobreza" (Game Against Poverty). He added: "Football is important for society and we want to show that. "We also think that football should be a fiesta, we had programmed and people deserve to enjoy the game." Return to results
Reilly requests âurgent actionâ to ensure agencies compliant with Government pay policy Reilly requests âurgent actionâ to ensure agencies compliant with Government pay policy Former chair of the Central Remedial Clinic, Des Peelo, has claimed that two of the âvery top peopleâ in the HSE attended a meeting in 2009 at which so-called top-ups being paid to senior staff were agreed to. Photograph: Bryan OâBrien The HSE has said that top-up payments for the chief executive and other senior staff in the Central Remedial Clinic (CRC) were ânot at any stage agreed to or sanctionedâ. The statement comes after a former chair of the CRC, Des Peelo claimed earlier today that two of the âvery top peopleâ in the HSE attended a meeting in 2009 at which privately-funded top-up payments for nine people in the organisation were agreed to. In an interview on RTÃ Radio 1 this morning, Mr Peelo said that, in a meeting held in June 2009, the HSE had agreed to fund the salaries up to the end of the year after which point the difference over and above the HSE-funded portion of the salaries would be funded privately. He said the HSE was âfully awareâ of this arrangement and that âevery year since 2010 the HSE get a list of salaries and they know about it...itâs been fully on the record and agreed with the HSEâ. Minister for Health James Reilly today met the director general of the HSE Tony OâBrien to seek an update on unsanctioned payments to management at organisations receiving funding under Section 38 of the 2004 Health Act. The Department of Health said Dr Reilly requested âurgent action to ensure that every agency is fully compliant with Government pay policyâ. âThe HSE will take whatever actions are necessary to deliver full compliance and ensure that any governance deficits identified are comprehensively rectified immediately. Meetings are now being arranged with each agency concerned,â the department said. âArising from this process, those found not to be compliant will be called in by the Director General to meet him before Christmas. Such meetings will commence next week.â A statement from the Central Remedial Clinic, released this evening, said that, in 2009, it had agreed with the HSE to phase out any existing management salaries being paid over and above the Department of Healthâs consolidated pay scales but that âin the meantime, the difference between the Department of Health pay scales and the contractually obligated salaries of these staff would be funded by the Central Remedial Clinic through the lottery proceeds received by the Friends of the CRCâ. âThis has been the case since then with regular reports being sent to the HSE confirming the portion of salaries being paid through both sources.â the statement said. However, the HSE this evening in a statement said: âThe arrangement entered into by CRC with its former chief executive and other senior staff at the organisation was not at any stage agreed to or sanctioned by the HSE. All HSE funded agencies are expected to comply with public pay policyâ. Return to results
Robots learn 'robotiquette' rules Robots learn 'robotiquette' rules Robots are learning lessons on "robotiquette" - how to behave socially - so they can mix better with humans. By playing games, like pass-the-parcel, a University of Hertfordshire team is finding out how future robot companions should react in social situations. The study's findings will eventually help humans develop a code of social behaviour in human-robot interaction. The work is part of the European Cogniron robotics project, and was on show at London's Science Museum. "We are assuming a situation in which a useful human companion robot already exists," said Professor Kerstin Dautenhahn, project leader at Hertfordshire. "Our mission is to look at how such a robot should be programmed to respect personal spaces of humans." The research also focuses on human perception of robots, including how they should look, and how a robot can learn new skills by imitating a human demonstrator. "Without such studies, you will build robots which might not respect the fact that humans are individuals, have preferences and come from different cultural backgrounds," Professor Dautenhahn told Online News News Online. "And I want robots to treat humans as human beings, and not like other robots," she added. In most situations, a companion robot will eventually have to deal not only with one person, but also with groups of people. To find out how they would react, the Hertfordshire Cogniron team taught one robot to play pass-the-parcel with children. Showing off its skills at the Science Museum, the unnamed robot had to select, approach, and ask different children to pick up a parcel with a gift, moving it arm as a pointer and its camera as an eye. It even used speech to give instructions and play music. However, according to researchers, it will still take many years to build a robot which would make full use of the "robotiquette" for human interaction. "If you think of a robot as a companion for the human being, you can think of 20 years into the future," concluded Professor Dautenhahn. "It might take even longer because it is very, very hard to develop such a robot." You can hear more on this story on the Online News World Service's Go Digital programme.
SPD rules out deal on banksâ legacy debt SPD rules out deal on banksâ legacy debt Spokesman for Angela Merkelâs likely coalition partner says it was a âmistakeâ to raise possibility of retrospective recapitalisation Carsten Schneider said direct recapitalisations should only be available in future for countries participating in a European programme to tax financial transactions. Photograoh: Thomas Koehler/Photothek via Getty Images Germanyâs Social Democratic Party (SPD) has ruled out supporting retrospective bank recapitalisation if the party enters a grand coalition under Chancellor Angela Merkel. Carsten Schneider , SPD budgetary spokesman and a coalition negotiator in Berlin, also said direct recapitalisations should only be available in future for countries participating in a European programme to tax financial transactions (FTT). Mr Schneider said he had âno problemâ with refinancing of banks underwritten by the FTT. âBut if the funds have to be transferred from national budgets then there will be no support from the SPD,â he told The Online News The remarks attach difficult conditions for future recapitalisations of Irish banks from the ESM bailout fund. He also has underlined his partyâs opposition to any reimbursement of public money invested by the Government into banks during the crisis. In their June 2012 meeting, EU leaders agreed to allow bank recapitalisation after establishing an EU supervisory mechanism, a move Taoiseach Enda Kenny described at the time as a âgame changerâ. Since then, however, Germany and others have distanced themselves from that prospect. Last month, German finance minister Wolfgang SchÃ¤uble said retrospective bank recapitalisation was ânot probable for the time beingâ. Any recapitalisations would require Bundestag backing but Mr Schneider and the SPD have always been more wary of anything that risks further exposure of German taxpayers to other countriesâ debt. In a clear message to his likely coalition partner yesterday in Berlin, Mr Schneider said there âshould be no illusionsâ about retrospective bank recapitalisation. âIt was a mistake of SchÃ¤uble to open this possibility as it was totally unrealistic. That possibility is, politically speaking, entirely unrealistic. I think it was a mistake to open this door as you can only disappoint expectations later.â The SPDâs link between future bank recapitalisations and the FTT creates a dilemma for Ireland. With Britain not participating in the FTT, the Government is planning to stay out as well out of concern that joining up would put the Irish financial sector at a disadvantage to the City of London. Mr Schneider said a recapitalisation regime would only come online by 2015 at the earliest, and then only after backing from the Bundestag. âI wouldnât rule out [future] bank recapitalisations ... if we get the financial transaction tax Europe-wide to finance it, otherwise no,â he said. As Ireland announced its EU/IMF programme exit yesterday, finance ministers in Brussels agreed that no backstop would be necessary for Spain as it approaches the end of its â¬41 billion bank bailout at the end of this year. âReform momentumâ Speaking after the meeting of finance ministers last night, eurogroup chairman Jeroen Dijsselbloem said the overall situation of the Spanish banking sector had improved significantly, including banksâ access to market funding. He stressed Spain needed to ârigorously continue the reform momentumâ to address ongoing challenges, including high unemployment and vulnerabilities stemming from continued high private and external debt. European commissioner Olli Rehn said exit strategies for programme countries would be developed on a case-by case basis, with a decision on Portugal, due to exit in June, to be made in due course. On the Greek programme, Mr Rehn said that âsignificant progress still had to be madeâ. Mr Dijsselbloem said it was âcrucialâ that Greece step up its efforts to agree with international lenders how to close a â¬2 billion financing gap in next yearâs budget. The most recent inspection by officials from the IMF, ECB and European Commission paused after commencing in September. There has been no progress since its resumption on November 4th.

Slow start to speedy net services Slow start to speedy net services Faster broadband in the UK is becoming a reality as more internet providers offer super-fast services. Some lucky Britons can already take advantage of UK Online's 8 megabits per second service, which was launched in November 2004. BT Retail has announced that it will trial the same speed service, with a national rollout by year end. Other service providers are expected to follow suit and a glut of new voice and video services will follow. "If the bandwidth is there then ISPs will buy it," said Jill Finger, a research director at analyst firm IDC. Others will be watching BT Retail's trials, which is initially for employees and later in the summer for customers, with interest. For BT Retail, she said, the super-fast service could be a way of differentiating it from other players. "It has been losing market share and this could be one way of gaining some of that back," said Ms Finger. Wanadoo is set to trial an 8Mbps service in the summer and also plans to roll out unbundled services - which means it takes over the network from BT - which will provide speeds of up to 15Mbps. There is no timetable for this at the moment. Cable firms ntl and Telewest are also bound to increase bandwidth at some time in the future and, according to an ntl spokesman, are in a better position than BT in the long term. "BT's network is limited compared to that of cable. With all the other services coming on stream such as video on demand, the question is will 8Mbps be enough?" he asked.

Smart search lets art fans browse Smart search lets art fans browse If you don't know art but know what you like, new search technology could prove a useful gateway to painting. ArtGarden, developed by BT's research unit, is being tested by the Tate as a new way of browsing its online collection of paintings. Rather than search by the name of an artist or painting, users are shown a selection of pictures. Clicking on their favourite will change the gallery in front of them to a selection of similar works. The technology uses a system dubbed smart serendipity, which is a combination of artificial intelligence and random selection. It 'chooses' a selection of pictures, by scoring paintings based on a selection of keywords associated with them. So, for instance a Whistler painting of a bridge may have the obvious keywords such as bridge and Whistler associated to it but will also widen the search net with terms such as aesthetic movement, 19th century and water. A variety of paintings will then be shown to the user, based partly on the keywords and partly on luck. "It is much more akin to wandering through the gallery," said Jemima Rellie, head of the Tate's digital programme. For Richard Tateson, who worked on the ArtGarden project, the need for a new way to search grew out of personal frustration. "I went to an online clothes store to find something to buy my wife for Christmas but I didn't have a clue what I wanted," he said. The text-based search was restricted to looking either by type of garment or designer, neither of which he found helpful. He ended up doing his present shopping on the high street instead. He thinks the dominance of text-based searching is not necessarily appealing to the majority of online shoppers. Similarly, with art, browsing is often more important than finding a particular object. "You don't arrive at Tate Britain and tell people what you want to see. One of the skills of showing off the collection is to introduce people to things they wouldn't have asked for," he said. The Tate is committed to making its art more accessible and technology such as ArtGarden can help with that, said Ms Rellie. She hopes the technology can be incorporated on to the website in the near future. BT research is looking at extending the technology to other searching, such as for music and films.

Software watching while you work Software watching while you work Software that can not only monitor every keystroke and action performed at a PC but also be used as legally binding evidence of wrong-doing has been unveiled. Worries about cyber-crime and sabotage have prompted many employers to consider monitoring employees. The developers behind the system claim it is a break-through in the way data is monitored and stored. But privacy advocates are concerned by the invasive nature of such software. The system is a joint venture between security firm 3ami and storage specialists BridgeHead Software. They have joined forces to create a system which can monitor computer activity, store it and retrieve disputed files within minutes. More and more firms are finding themselves in deep water as a result of data misuse. Sabotage and data theft are most commonly committed from within an organisation according to the National Hi-Tech Crime Unit (NHTCU) A survey conducted on its behalf by NOP found evidence that more than 80% of medium and large companies have been victims of some form of cyber-crime. BridgeHead Software has come up with techniques to prove, to a legal standard, that any stored file on a PC has not been tampered with. Ironically the impetus for developing the system came as a result of the Freedom of Information Act, which requires companies to store all data for a certain amount of time. The storage system has been incorporated into an application developed by security firm 3ami which allows every action on a computer to be logged. Potentially it could help employers to follow the trail of stolen files and pinpoint whether they had been emailed to a third party, copied, printed, deleted or saved to CD, floppy disk, memory stick or flash card. Other activities the system can monitor include the downloading of pornography, the use of racist or bullying language or the copying of applications for personal use. Increasingly organisations that handle sensitive data, such as governments, are using biometric log-ins such as fingerprinting to provide conclusive proof of who was using a particular machine at any given time. Privacy advocates are concerned that monitoring at work is not only damaging to employee's privacy but also to the relationship between employers and their staff. "That is not the case," said Tim Ellsmore, managing director of 3ami. "It is not about replacing dialogue but there are issues that you can talk through but you still need proof," he said. "People need to recognise that you are using a PC as a representative of a company and that employers have a legal requirement to store data," he added. Comments are closed for this article.
Solskjaer raises hopes of return Solskjaer raises hopes of return Manchester United striker Ole Gunnar Solskjaer said he hoped to return next season following a career-threatening injury to his right knee. The 31-year-old Norway international had surgery in Sweden in August to transplant cartilage into the joint. "I'm in no doubt that I'll play again," Solskjaer told Aftenposten Daily. "The problem will be the speed but we're talking about eight months' time. It's going as it should with the knee. I'm slavishly following a programme." Solskjaer last played for United as a late substitute in May's FA Cup final win over Millwall. His contract with United runs out in 2006, by which time he will have been at the Premier League club for 10 years. Return to results
Sony PSP handheld console hits US Sony PSP handheld console hits US The latest handheld gaming gadget, Sony's PlayStation Portable, goes on sale in the US on Thursday. The entertainment device, which also stores images, music and video, is intended to compete with Nintendo's DS, released earlier this month in the UK. Gamers have been queuing outside shops across the US to get their hands on the gadget, which costs $250 (about Â£132). The first million sold will come with the Spider-Man 2 film on UMD, Sony's own disc format for the device. The PSP can be linked up with others for multiplayer gaming, via a wireless connection. Sony has touted the machine as the Walkman of the 21st Century and has sold more than 800,000 units in Japan since its launch there last year. But it faces stiff competition from the Nintendo DS, which sold more than the GameCube in its first few days on release in Europe. It too allows for multiplayer gaming over the air. Nintendo dominates the handheld market, with more than a 90% share of the market in the US alone. The Gizmondo combined media player, phone and gaming gadget also went on sale in the UK last week. It hopes to take a share of the handheld gaming market too. "The story of the PSP is it's not a gaming device as much as it is a portable entertainment device," said Michael Pachter, analyst at Wedbush Morgan Securities. He told the Online News news agency that he expected Sony to sell about 10 million PSPs in enough time to rival Apple's iPod. There is no date for the PSP's release in Europe yet. Sony has promised to have a million units ready for its US launch, but there are fears demand may not be met. It also said it expected to ship three million PSPs worldwide by the end of its fiscal year ending 31 March. The machine's European launch was put back "a few months" last week in order to make sure enough of the devices were ready for its US launch, as well as satisfying the Japanese market. The PSP has almost as much processing power in it as the PlayStation 2 console. Hundreds of gamers gathered at US shops, some waiting for more than 36 hours, to be the first to get their hands on the gadget. A spokesman for one US shop said it expected the device to sell out on its first day. The 24 games for the mini console include Ape Academy, Formula One, Wipeout Pure and Fired Up. Movie studios, including Lions Gate Entertainment and Disney, have also announced forthcoming film titles that will be made available on the UMD format. Return to results
Speak easy plan for media players Speak easy plan for media players Music and film fans will be able to control their digital media players just by speaking to them, under plans in development by two US firms. ScanSoft and Gracenote are developing technology to give people access to their film and music libraries simply by voice control. They want to give people hands-free access to digital music and films in the car, or at home or on the move. Huge media libraries on some players can make finding single songs hard. "Voice command-and-control unlocks the potential of devices that can store large digital music collections," said Ross Blanchard, vice president of business development for Gracenote. "These applications will radically change the car entertainment experience, allowing drivers to enjoy their entire music collections without ever taking their hands off the steering wheel," he added. Gracenote provides music library information for millions of different albums for jukeboxes such as Apple's iTunes. The new technology will be designed so that people can play any individual song or movie out of a collection, just by saying its name. Users will also be able to request music that fits a mood or an occasion, or a film just by saying the actor's name. "Speech is a natural fit for today's consumer devices, particularly in mobile environments," said Alan Schwartz, vice president of SpeechWorks, a division of ScanSoft. "Pairing our voice technologies with Gracenote's vast music database will bring the benefits of speech technologies to a host of consumer devices and enable people to access their media in ways they've never imagined." The two firms did not say if they were developing the technology for languages other than English. Users will also be able to get more information on a favourite song they have been listening to by asking: "What is this?" Portable players are becoming popular in cars and a number of auto firms are working with Apple to device interfaces to control the firm's iPod music player. But with tens of thousands of songs able to be stored on one player, voice control would make finding that elusive track by Elvis Presley much easier. The firms gave no indication about whether the iPod, or any other media player, were in mind for the use of the voice control technology. The companies estimate that the technology will be available in the fourth quarter of 2005. Return to results
Tanzania gets Fifa backing Tanzania gets Fifa backing Fifa is to give financial support to Tanzania in order to revive football in the country after years of mismanagement. This follows a meeting between officials of the Tanzania Football Federation (TFF) and the president of Fifa, Sepp Blatter last week in Switzerland. The TFF President Leodegar Tenga said on Wednesday that Fifa has promised them an immediate donation of office equipment worth US$10,000 and US$17,705 cash. Tenga said that the money would be used to settle part of the debt owed to Caf. African football's governing body has threatened to disqualify the Taifa Stars from its competitions. Tanzania have failed to pay fines imposed on them following their withdrawal from the African Cup of Nations qualifier against Sudan in 2003. Tenga said that Fifa has also offered to organize courses for Tanzanian referees and support development programmes. A full-time Chief Executive Officer (CEO) will be employed in order to draw up a development programme which will also be funded by Fifa. "We will employ a CEO in the near future who will implement our short and long term development programmes", Tenga said. "Fifa has promised to help us in all our programmes which are geared to revive the football in Tanzania." The Tenga-led TFF leadership came into office last year ending the long reign of Muhidin Ndolanga. Return to results
Tech helps disabled speed demons Tech helps disabled speed demons An organisation has been launched to encourage disabled people to get involved in all aspects of motorsport, which is now increasingly possible thanks to technological innovations. The Motorsport Endeavour Club left the starting grid yesterday at the Autosport International 2005 show at Birmingham's NEC, with several technologies to adapt vehicles on display. Motorcycle racer, Roy Tansley, from Derby developed his electronic sequential gear changer following an accident which resulted in part of his left leg being amputated. "I needed to find a way of changing gear and generally you do that with your left leg," Mr Tansley told the Online News News website. "In simple terms, I needed to invent a left foot - initially it was quite a Heath Robinson device." Mr Tansley had to argue his case to be allowed to continue competing with motorcycle racing's governing body, the Autocycle Union. "At that time they wouldn't let any amputee race at all, but eventually they told me I could have a licence as long as I raced sidecars." Mr Tansley's invention, the Pro-Shift, is designed to work with Hewland gearboxes which are widely used in motorcycle racing. In addition to helping disabled riders to compete, Mr Tansley reckons that the Pro-Shift saves at least 20 seconds per lap when he competes in the Isle of Man TT. As a result, there has been considerable interest in the product from other riders keen to improve their performance. "I'm not prejudiced, I'll sell to able-bodied people if I have to!" he joked. Another exhibit on the Motorsport Endeavour stand is a Subaru Impreza rally car, adapted to accommodate a variety of disabilities. The vehicle belongs to ParaRallying, the world's only rally school for disabled drivers which is based in Lincolnshire. "We use the latest technology supplied by an Italian company," said rally driver Dave Hawkins who runs the company. "The cars have electronic throttles, electronic brakes, electronic clutches - we've yet to turn anybody away." Mr Hawkins - a paraplegic himself - says his customers have included right or left arm amputees, quadriplegics, people who have had strokes and a woman who had had all four limbs amputated. ParaRallying uses a Vauxhall Astra GSI with an automatic gearbox and manual Subaru Imprezas. The car on display is fitted with a 'duck clutch' - a switch on the gear stick used instead of the clutch pedal. It also has a second ring behind the steering wheel to operate the throttle and a hand operated brake bar. When Joy Rainey started competing in motorsport in 1974 she was continuing the family tradition - her father, Murray, is a former Australian Formula 3 champion. And it was Rainey Senior who modified a sports racer to accommodate his daughter's small stature so that she could take part in hill climbs. She uses an ordinary road car by putting extensions on the pedals, a cushion behind her back and raising the seat. "But in a competition car you have to have everything right or you'll lose the balance of the car," she said. "I bring everything back to me - steering wheel, steering column, gear lever and pedals." When she recently took part in the London to Sydney Marathon she shared the driving with her partner, Trevor, who now does the engineering work. He designed a system for their Morris Minor so that the adaptations could be totally removed in under a minute. The Motorsport Endeavour Club is hoping that putting such technologies on display will result in more disabled people becoming involved in all areas of the sport and at every level.

Tevez - an Argentine in Brazil Tevez - an Argentine in Brazil Some 65 years ago Bernardo Gandulla left Boca Juniors in his native Argentina and headed for Brazil. He arrived at the Vasco da Gama club with considerable prestige - which he failed to live up to. He left an impression, but not for reasons he would have wanted. The only thing of note he did was to throw the ball back when it went out of play. Even today, 'gandula' is the term used in Brazil for ballboy. Brazilians delighted in the failure of Gandulla then, and many will delight now if history is repeated. Another Boca Juniors player is coming to Brazil. 'The new Maradona' - Carlos Tevez - is joining Corinthians for nearly $20m in a strong candidate for the strangest move of the year. Corinthians - or the London-based company who have just entered into partnership with them - appear to have paid well above the odds for Tevez. It is particularly strange as - until last week - Tevez was not even an especially big name in Brazil, where the Argentine Championship is not shown. Presumably there is some financial logic behind the move. What is harder to work out is why Tevez should be interested in heading north, rather than across the Atlantic. Argentina's brightest new star hit top form in August as he spearheaded the charge towards the Olympic gold medal. But the subsequent months have not been easy for Tevez. Boca re-signed Martin Palermo, forcing Tevez to vacate his favoured centre forward role. And off the pitch he gave the press plenty to report - Atletico Madrid gave up on him after declaring his private life to be 'disorganized.' Hounded by the press, Tevez grew tired of his life in Buenos Aires. So now he says that he is heading for Corinthians in search of 'tranquillity.' Anyone acquainted with the city of S&#227;o Paulo will relish the nonsense of this declaration. Brazil's biggest city is a sprawling, ugly, restless metropolis. Once it shared with Buenos Aires the same melancholy air of a city of Italian immigrants. But that world now lies buried under skyscrapers. The most turbulent place in this frenetic city is Sport Club Corinthians. It is the most passionately supported club in Brazil. Pel&#233; scored reams of goals against them, reasoning that unless he did something special the Corinthians fans were capable of winning the game on their own. That passion can also be turned against the team - especially nowadays, when the level of urban violence gives a hysterical edge to life in Brazil's big cities. Corinthians fans have invaded the dressing room or ambushed the team coach to attack the players. Tevez, then, can kiss tranquillity goodbye. He can also say farewell to the Copa Libertadores, South America's Champions League. Corinthians have not qualified. Indeed, he will have a long wait for a worthwhile match. Next year's Brazilian Championship only gets underway at the end of April. Until then he will have to make do with the foolish S&#227;o Paulo State Championship, an appalling waste of his talent. There will be matches in small towns on poor pitches with plenty of defenders keen to kick him all the way back to Argentina. Like so many of the top South American players, Tevez has the gift of being able to surprise - to feint right and go left, to pass when he was expected to dribble, to shoot and catch the goalkeeper unawares. But his choice of destination is the biggest surprise of all. Return to results
The countryâs unemployment rate, as measured by the Live Register, fell to 12.5 per cent last month,... The countryâs unemployment rate, as measured by the Live Register, fell to 12.5 per cent last month, its lowest level in three and a half years. In an another welcome boost for the Government, the latest figures from the Central Statistic Office showed the number of people claiming benefits dropped by 3,400 in November, the 17th successive monthly decline. This brought the overall number of claimants down to 406,200 at the end of October, down from 409,600 the previous month, giving a standardised rate of unemployment of 12.5 per cent. The unadjusted register, which fails to take account of part-time and seasonal workers as well as those on Jobseekerâs Allowance, was 391,507. Over the past 12 months, the number on the register has dropped by 25,770 or 6.2 per cent. The figures also showed the number of long-term claimants on the dole for more than a year had fallen to 179,758, as against 182,401 the previous month and 186,562 a year ago. The unemployment rate, based on the Live Register, has declined steadily since its post-crash peak of 15.1 per cent in February last year. The CSOâs Quarterly National Household Survey, released last month, indicated unemployment stood at 12.8 per cent in the third quarter of 2013, down from 13.6 per cent in the second quarter. Conall Mac Coille, chief economist with Davy stockbrokers, said Irelandâs unemployment rate has now almost converged to the euro area aggregate of 12.1 per cent. â Live Register numbers reinforce our view that the underlying trends in the Irish economy are more favourable than suggested by the GDP data and that the economy should rebound in the second half of 2013,â he said. Alan McQuaid of Merrion Stockbrokers said: âWhile emigration has clearly been a factor in bringing the unemployment figures down, there are encouraging signs on the labour market front.â The Small Firms Association called on Government to tackle the social welfare trap and put the best interests of the Irish economy above their re-election ambitions. Mark Fielding of Irish Small & Medium Enterprises Association said the social welfare trap was ânot only acting as a disincentive to taking up gainful employment but also directly leading to increased black economy activity, which threatens the viability of legitimate businessesâ. âThey are doing nobody any favours by allowing embedded high business costs and a culture of social welfare dependency to become entrenched in Irish society,â he said.

Thousands of over-70s to lose full GP cards Thousands of over-70s to lose full GP cards Prescription charges for medical card holders to increase from â¬1.50 to â¬2.50 per item Check-up: changes to the allocation of medical cards for older people and prescription charges are among the measures to be announced in todayâs budget. Photograph: Hugh Macknight/PA Paul Cullen, Martin Wall Thousands of over-70s will lose their full GP cards while the prescription charge for medical card holders is being increased by â¬1 in measures to be announced in todayâs budget. The eligibility limits for full GP cards for over-70s, which cover the cost of drugs as well as doctor visits, are being tightened for a second year in a row, though those affected will still qualify for GP visit cards. Prescription charge increase Minister for Finance Michael Noonan will also announce in his budget speech this afternoon that the prescription charge for medical card holders is being increased from â¬1.50 per item to â¬2.50. The Government will also raise from â¬19.50 to â¬25 the monthly ceiling on the amount which medical card holders can be required to pay in prescription charges. The charge was increased from 50 cent to â¬1.50 per item in last yearâs budget. The move is expected to generate about â¬40 million in additional revenue for the health service. In opposition, Minister for Health James Reilly opposed the introduction of prescription charges and he then promised to abolish them when appointed Minister. When they were increased, he said he was just one member of the Cabinet and he could not win all the battles. Mr Noonan will also clarify that the much-leaked proposal to extend free GP care to young children applies to those aged five and under. It will, therefore, provide for GP visit cards for the under-sixes, rather than under-fives. The Government has decided not to provide full GP cards for this age cohort, even though the additional cost has been estimated at less than â¬10 million a year. The measure, which will require legislation, will be introduced next year, although the Minister will not specify an implementation date in todayâs speech. Sources say people should not expect it to be ready for introduction in January. The change to eligibility thresholds for over-70s medical cards will also require legislation. In last yearâs budget, the gross income threshold for an over-70s medical card was lowered from â¬700 a week to â¬600 for a single person, and from â¬1,400 a week to â¬1,200 for a couple. This affected 20,000 medical card holders. The introduction of free GP care for young children is an interim step on the road to free GP care for all, still scheduled to happen in 2015. It is likely that at least one further interim step extending eligibility to under 10s or under-12s will take place before universal cover is introduced. âPolitical stuntâ The plan drew fire from the Irish Medical Organisation , which described the initiative as a âpolitical stuntâ and warned it was not covered by existing agreements and would have to be the subject of negotiations. Chairman of the organisationâs GP committee Dr Ray Walley said the Government âis presiding over the widespread rationing of discretionary medical cards for people with long-term illnesses and real medical needs and now itâs engaging in a stunt by extending these cards to tens of thousands of children in relatively wealthy families who by any measure do not need themâ. Dr Walley said that there was no medical evidence to back up the extension of medical cards to a wide category of the population. The Irish College of General Practitioners said the plan represented a âmajor changeâ in the way health services are organised and paid for. The college warned of an âinevitable surgeâ in demand when childrenâs services were free and questioned whether the â¬40 million estimated cost was adequate. .

Tough rules for ringtone sellers Tough rules for ringtone sellers Firms that flout rules on how ringtones and other mobile extras are sold could be cut off from all UK phone networks. The rules allow offenders to be cut off if they do not let consumers know exactly what they get for their money and how to turn off the services. The first month under the new rules has seen at least ten firms suspended while they clean up the way they work. The rules have been brought in to ensure that the problems plaguing net users do not spread to mobile phones. In the last couple of years ringtones, wallpapers, screensavers and lots of other extras for phones have become hugely popular. But fierce competition is making it difficult for firms to get their wares in front of consumers, said Jeremy Flynn, head of third party services at Vodafone. "If you are not on the operator's portal you are going to have quite heavy marketing costs because it's a problem of how people discover your services," he said. To combat this many ringtone and other mobile content sellers started using a new tactic to squeeze more cash out of customers. This tactic involved signing people up for a subscription to give them, for instance, several ringtones per week or month instead of the single track they thought they were getting. Mr Flynn said that the move to using subscriptions happened over the space of a few weeks at the end of 2004. Websites such as grumbletext.co.uk started getting reports from customers who were racking up large bills for phone content they did not know they had signed up for. "What made us uncomfortable was that these services were not being marketed transparently," said Mr Flynn. "People did not know they were being offered a subscription service." "We saw potential for substantial consumer harm here," he added. The swift adoption of subscription services led to the creation of a new code of conduct for firms that want to sell content for mobile phones. The drafting of the new rules was led by the Mobile Entertainment Forum and the UK's phone firms. "Everyone is required to conform to this code of conduct," said Andrew Bud, regulatory head of the MEF and executive chairman of messaging firm MBlox. "It's all about transparency," he said. "Consumers have to be told what they have got themselves into and how to get out of it." "The consumer has a right to be protected," he said. Christian Harris, partnership manager of mobile content firm Zed, said the new system was essential if consumers were to trust companies that sell ringtones and other downloads. "The groundrules must be applied across the whole industry and if that's done effectively we will see the cowboys driven out," he said. The new rules came in to force on 15 January and the first month under the new regime has seen many firms cautioned for not honouring them. Some have been told to revamp websites so customers know what they get for their money and what they are signing up for, said Mr Flynn. Also, said Mr Flynn, Vodafone has briefly cut off between eight and ten content sellers flouting the rules. "We have quite draconian contracts with firms," he said. "We do not have to say why. We can just cut them off." Under the rules consumers must be able to switch off the services by using a universal "stop" command sent via text message. He said the system had been designed to limit how much a consumer will pay if they inadvertently signed up for a service. "The mobile is so personal that people really resent the abuse of what is effectively part of their personality," said Mr Flynn. Return to results
Toxic web links help virus spread Toxic web links help virus spread Virus writers have begun using the power of the web to spread their malicious wares. A Windows virus called Bofra is turning infected machines into distributors of its malicious code. Those clicking on the poisoned links in e-mail messages sent out by infected machines may fall victim to the virus. The trick is being used to prevent the progam being caught by anti-virus software that combs through code contained in e-mail attachments. The virus that uses this trick is called Bofra and the first member of the family of worms appeared on 10 November. They exploit a Windows vulnerability that was discovered only a few days earlier. Like many other recent viruses, Bofra plunders the address book in Microsoft Outlook for e-mail addresses and scours other files on an infected machine for fresh target addresses. The virus uses its own mail sending software to despatch e-mail messages to potential victims but, unlike many other recent viruses, does not itself travel via mail. Instead the body of the mail messages sent out contain fake weblinks that, when clicked on, connect back to the machine that distributed that e-mail. Essentially, Bofra turns infected machines into small web servers that happily dole out copies of the virus. The messages try to trick people into clicking on the links by promising pornographic videos and images or by posing as payment confirmation for a Paypal transaction. Copies of the messages seen by the Online News News website had bright yellow and green backgrounds. Those clicking on the links will inadvertently download the Bofra virus which will then start searching for new addresses to send itself to. Filtering firm Clearswift said this tactic of creating thousands of mini web servers was designed to help the virus spread quickly and avoid attempts to shut it down. In the past other malicious programs have relied on a single web server that downloads viral code to target machines. Shutting down this central server usually stops the virus spreading. Clearswift said that fact that no viral code travels in the e-mail messages sent out by machines infected by Bofra could hamper effects to limit its spread. Finnish anti-virus firm F-Secure said that, so far, it had not seen many copies of the Bofra virus and its variants in circulation. Tim Warner, spokesman for anti-virus firm Finjan, said: "You have people getting very creative now to deliver the virus and get it propagating." Mr Warner said organisations needed to prepare deep defences to keep out the modern form of malicious mobile code. "Most firms have secured their e-mail gateway," said Mr Warner, "but the irony is that most of them let malicious content through the web gateways." He said behavioural systems that monitor what users do can help to spot when viruses have penetrated organisations and have started hunting for other victims. The Bofra family of viruses, which were originally thought to be offshoots of the MyDoom bug, can infect machines running Windows 2000, 95, 98, Me, NT, XP and Server 2003. Users running Windows XP that have applied the SP2 update are not vulnerable to the loophole that Bofra exploits. Comments are closed for this article.
Troika says discussions with Athens will continue Troika says discussions with Athens will continue The European Commission, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund said good progress has been made in Greece, but a few issues remain outstanding. Photograph: Mal Langsdon/Online News Some issues remain open on Greeceâs progress in economic reform, international lenders said today, after an examination of the countryâs efforts to meet conditions needed to secure further financial aid. âGood progress has been made, but a few issues remain outstanding. The discussions will continue from respective headquarters,â a joint statement said. The two sides have been at odd for months over the size of budget savings required for Greece to meet its fiscal targets. The group intends to return to Athens to continue their review in early December. (Online News) Comments are closed for this article.
US woman sues over cartridges US woman sues over cartridges A US woman is suing Hewlett Packard (HP), saying its printer ink cartridges are secretly programmed to expire on a certain date. The unnamed woman from Georgia says that a chip inside the cartridge tells the printer that it needs re-filling even when it does not. The lawsuit seeks to represent anyone in the US who has purchased an HP inkjet printer since February 2001. HP, the world's biggest printer firm, declined to comment on the lawsuit. HP ink cartridges use a chip technology to sense when they are low on ink and advise the user to make a change. But the suit claims the chips also shut down the cartridges at a predetermined date regardless of whether they are empty. "The smart chip is dually engineered to prematurely register ink depletion and to render a cartridge unusable through the use of a built-in expiration date that is not revealed to the consumer," the suit said. The lawsuit is asking for restitution, damages and other compensation. The cost of printer cartridges has been a contentious issue in Europe for the last 18 months. The price of inkjet printers has come down to as little as Â£34 but it could cost up to Â£1,700 in running costs over an 18-month period due to cartridge, a study by Computeractive Magazine revealed last year. The inkjet printer market has been the subject of an investigation by the UK's Office of Fair Trading (OFT), which concluded in a 2002 report that retailers and manufacturers needed to make pricing more transparent for consumers.

Uefa threat over foreign quotas Uefa threat over foreign quotas Uefa has warned clubs planning to ignore its proposal for quotas of homegrown players in squads. From 2006-07 teams must submit a 25-man 'A' squad with at least two players from the club academy and two others from the same national association. Clubs may be punished with reduced squads if they refuse to comply, although Uefa has ruled out legal action against offending clubs. Arsenal had 16 overseas players for Monday's game with Crystal Palace. After the plan is introduced for the 2006-07 season the figures will rise by one for each of the next two seasons. So by 2008-09 the squad will have to contain four academy players and four others from the team's country. "The sanction is fairly simple - if you don't have the four and four for 2008-09, your squad will be cut by the number of players that do not meet the criteria," said Uefa spokesman William Gaillard. At present the ruling is only going to apply to Uefa competitions, but in April a Uefa Congress in Estonia will vote on whether to implement the measures in domestic competitions as well. But the Premier League say it is "extremely unlikely" it would be implemented in England. Arsenal chairman Peter Hill-Wood has made shrugged off criticism of Wenger's team selection, and told the Evening Standard he was happy with how things were at the club. "For me, the nationality of any player who plays for the club is not an issue," he said. "If you have good enough players then it does not matter from which country they come. "These days, the world is smaller. We have young players from all over the world in our youth set-up. "The world of football is changing, and there are some people who don't like things to change.

Uganda FA suspended Uganda FA suspended In a move likely to incur the wrath of Fifa, Ugandan Sports Minister Geraldine Namirembe Bitamazire suspended the country's FA with immediate effect on Wednesday. Bitamazire ordered the Denis Obua-led executive committee to hand over all the "movable and immovable property of the federation within two weeks." The Uganda FA was due to hold elections next week but the government has called off the poll. The minister has instructed the National Council of Sports (NCS) take over as the interim body as the government conducts an investigation into the affairs of the Uganda FA. The general secretary of the NCS was also ordered to freeze all accounts of the FA and inform the banks that the leadership of this association has lost the mandate to operate these accounts. But the man at the centre of the storm remains defiant, and told Online News Sport that the government's move is not in the interest of Uganda football. "We're only answerable to Fifa," said Obua, who is also the chairman of East and Central Africa's regional body, Cecafa. He added: "The world federation doesn't know our government. They [government] are banning football in Uganda and not Obua." A statement from the sports minister's office said "the FA had been operating in a manner that is inconsistent with the law." It accused the Uganda FA of mortgaging its headquarters which was constructed using funds donated under the Fifa Goal Project. The Uganda FA has been beset by financial problems for some time now. It recently had its furniture attached by court bailiffs for failure to pay outstanding debts. Return to results
Video phones act as dating tools Video phones act as dating tools Technologies, from e-mail, to net chatrooms, instant messaging and mobiles, have proved to be a big pull with those looking for love. The lure once was that you could hide behind the technology, but now video phones are in on the act to add vision. Hundreds have submitted a mobile video profile to win a place at the world's first video mobile dating event. The top 100 meet their match on 30 November at London's Institute of Contemporary Arts (ICA). The event, organised by the 3G network, 3, could catch on as the trend for unusual dating events, like speed dating, continues. "It's the beginning of the end of the blind date as we know it," said Graeme Oxby, 3's marketing director. The response has been so promising that 3 says it is planning to launch a proper commercial dating service soon. Hundreds of hopefuls submitted their profiles, and special booths were set up in a major London department store for two weeks where expert tips were given on how to visually improve their chances. The 100 most popular contestants voted by the public will gather at the ICA in separate rooms and "meet" by phone. Dating services and other more adult match-making services are proving to be a strong stream of revenue worth millions for mobile companies. Whether it does actually provide an interesting match for video phone technologies remains to be seen. Flic Everett, journalist and dating expert for Company magazine and the Daily Express, thinks technology has been liberating for some nervous soul-mate seekers. There are currently about 1.3 million video phones in use in the UK and three times more single people in Britain than there were 30 years ago, With more people buying video mobiles, 3G dating could be the basis for a successful and safe way to meet people. "One of the problems with video phones is people don't really know what to video. It is a weird technology. We have not quite worked out what it is for. This gives it a focus and a useful one," she told Online News News. "I would never have thought online dating would take off the way it did," she said. "Lots of people find it easier to be honest writing e-mail or text than face-to-face. Lots people are quite shy and they feel vulnerable." "When you are writing, it comes directly onto the page so they tend to be more honest." But the barrier that comes with SMS chat and online match-making is that the person behind the profile may not be who they really are. Scare stories have put people off as a result, according to Ms Everett. Many physical clues, body language, odd twitches, are obviously missing with SMS and online dating services. Still images do not necessarily provide all those necessary cues. "It could really take off because you do get the whole package. With a static e-mail picture, you don't know who the person is behind it is." So checking out a potential date by video phone also gives singletons a different kind of barrier, an extra layer of protection; a case of WLTS before WLTM. "If you are trapped in real-life blind date context, you can't get away and you feel embarrassed. "With a video meeting, you really have the barrier of the phone so if you don't like them you don't have to suffer the embarrassment." There is a more serious side to this new use of technology though. With money being made through more adult-themes content and services which let people meet and chat, the revenue streams for mobile carriers will grow with 3G, thinks Paolo Pescatore mobile industry specialist for analysts IDC. "Wireless is a medium that is being exploited with a number of features and services. One is chatting and the dating element is key there," he said. "The foundation has been set by SMS and companies are using media like MMS and video to grow the market further." But carriers need to be wary and ensure that if they do launch such 3G dating services, they ensure mechanism are in place to monitor and be aware who is registers and accesses these services on regular basis, he cautioned. In July, Vodafone introduced a content control system to protect children from such adult content. The move was as a result of a code of practice agreed by the UK's six largest mobile phone operators in January. The system means Vodafone users need to prove they are over 18 before firewalls are lifted on explicit websites or chat rooms dealing with adult themes. The impetus was the growing number of people with handsets that could access the net, and the growth of 3G technologies. Comments are closed for this article.
Viewers to be able to shape TV Viewers to be able to shape TV Imagine editing Titanic down to watch just your favourite bits or cutting out the slushier moments of Star Wars to leave you with a bare bones action-fest. Manipulating your favourite films to make a more personalised movie is just the beginning of an ambitious new 7.5m euro (Â£5.1m) project funded by the European Union. New Media for a New Millennium (NM2) will have as its endgame the development of a completely new media genre, which will allow audiences to create their own media worlds based on their specific interests or tastes. Viewers will be able to participate in storylines, manipulate plots and even the sets and props of TV shows. BT is one of 13 partners involved in the project. It will be contributing software that was originally designed to spot anomalies in CCTV pictures. The software uses content recognition algorithms. The three-year project will work on seven productions as it develops a set of software tools that will allow viewers to edit content to their needs. One of the productions will be a experimental television show where the plot will be driven by text messages from the TV audience. Participants will text selected words which will impact how the characters in the drama interact. It is being developed in Finland and will be shown to Finnish TV audiences. Another team will work on the Online News's big budget drama of Mervyn Peake's gothic fantasy Gormenghast. It will be re-engineered to allow people to choose a variety of edited versions. "The Online News is allowing us access to the material so that we can prove the technology and the principles," explained Dr Doug Williams of BT, who will be NM2's technical project manager. "The TV at the moment is a relatively dumb box which receives signals. This project is about teaching the machine to look at content like Lego blocks that can be reassembled to make perfect sense," he said. "At the moment we have interactive gaming and a limited form of interactive TV which usually means allowing audiences to vote on shows. We are hoping to occupy the space in-between," he added. NM2's co-ordinator Peter Stollenmayer explained that the new genre would radically alter the role of the audience. "Viewers will be able to interact directly with the medium and influence what they see and hear according to their personal tastes and wishes," he said. "Media users will no longer be passive viewers but become active engagers." It will also be important that the tools are sophisticated enough to obey the complex rules of cinematography and editing said John Wyver, from TV producer Illuminations Television Limited, which is also involved in the project. "It's not just a matter of stringing together the romantic or action portions of a production," said Mr Wyver. "The tool has to know which bits fit together both visually, by observing the time-honoured rules that go in editing, and in terms of the story." "Only then will the personalised version both make sense and be aesthetically pleasing," he added. Mr Wyver is planning a production entitled The Golden Age, about Renaissance art. It will allow viewers to create a so-called media world based on their own specific areas of interest such as poetry, music and architecture. Other productions that the NM2 team will make range from news, documentaries to a romantic comedy drama. Return to results
Volume of retail trade drops 0.6 per cent in September Volume of retail trade drops 0.6 per cent in September Euro zone retail sales fell more than expected in September, data showed today, as shoppers held back with purchases amid a slow economic recovery weighed down by record high unemployment and tight access to credit. The volume of retail trade fell 0.6 per cent on the month after a revised 0.5 per cent rise in August, the EUâs statistics office Eurostat said. Sales of both food and non-food products fell and the volume of sales of automotive fuels was flat on the month. Compared with the same period last year, September retail sales were up 0.3 per cent, following three straight months of declines, the data showed. Domestic demand in the euro zone is stifled by the blocâs longest recession since the creation of the euro in 1999. It is also dented by record high unemployment of 12.2 per cent and uncertainty over when the economy will pick up more strongly. The decline in retail sales was especially significant in the southern Europe , with Portugal recording an all-time low with a 6.2 per cent slump on the month and Spainâs 2.5 per cent decline was the biggest since April 2012. Slovenia , now at risk of needing international financial assistance in case it fails to fix its banks and reform the economy, saw a 4.0 per cent fall month-on-month in sales in September, the biggest decline since February 2009. The European Commission expects economic recovery to get on a slightly more solid footing next year, but domestic demand is still weak as more than 19 million people in the euro zone are out of jobs. Weak consumer spending is also a concern for the European Central Bank which is expected to keep interest rates at record lows tomorrow despite a sharp drop in inflation, which fell to a nearly four-year lows in October.

Warning over tsunami aid website Warning over tsunami aid website Net users are being told to avoid a scam website that claims to collect cash on behalf of tsunami victims. The site looks plausible because it uses an old version of the official Disasters Emergency Committee webpage. However, DEC has no connection with the fake site and says it has contacted the police about it. The site is just the latest in a long list of scams that try to cash in on the goodwill generated by the tsunami disaster. The link to the website is contained in a spam e-mail that is currently circulating. The message's subject line reads "Urgent Tsunami Earthquake Appeal" and its text bears all the poor grammar and bad spelling that characterises many other phishing attempts. The web address of the fake site is decuk.org which could be close enough to the official www.dec.org.uk address to confuse some people keen to donate. Patricia Sanders, spokeswoman for the Disaster Emergency Committee said it was aware of the site and had contacted the Computer Crime Unit at Scotland Yard to help get it shut down. She said the spam e-mails directing people to the site started circulating two days ago shortly after the domain name of the site was registered. It is thought that the fake site is being run from Romania. Ms Sanders said DEC had contacted US net registrars who handle domain ownership and the net hosting firm that is keeping the site on the web. DEC was going to push for all cash donated via the site to be handed over to the official organisation. BT and DEC's hosting company were also making efforts to get the site shut down, she said. Ms Sanders said sending out spam e-mail to solicit donations was not DEC's style and that it would never canvass support in this way. She said that DEC hoped to get the fake site shut down as soon as possible. All attempts by the Online News News website to contact the people behind the site have failed. None of the e-mail addresses supplied on the site work and the real owner of the domain is obscured in publicly available net records. This is not the first attempt to cash in on the outpouring of goodwill that has accompanied appeals for tsunami aid. One e-mail sent out in early January came from someone who claimed that he had lost his parents in the disaster and was asking for help moving an inheritance from a bank account in the Netherlands. The con was very similar to the familiar Nigerian forward fee fraud e-mails that milk money out of people by promising them a cut of a much larger cash pile. Other scam e-mails included a link to a website that supposedly let people donate money but instead loaded spyware on their computers that grabbed confidential information. In a monthly report anti-virus firm Sophos said that two e-mail messages about the tsunami made it to the top 10 hoax list during January. Another tsunami-related e-mail is also circulating that carries the Zar worm which tries to spread via the familiar route of Microsoft's Outlook e-mail program. Anyone opening the attachment of the mail will have their contact list plundered by the worm keen to find new addresses to send itself to. Comments are closed for this article.
Wenger steps up row Wenger steps up row Arsene Wenger has stepped up his feud with Sir Alex Ferguson by claiming the Manchester United manager is guilty of bringing football into disrepute. The pair's long-running row was put back in the headlines on Saturday when Ferguson said his Arsenal counterpart was "a disgrace". Wenger initially refused to bite back, saying only: "I will never answer any questions any more about this man." But now he claims Ferguson should be punished by the Football Association. The latest twist in the Ferguson-Wenger saga came on Saturday when the United boss, in an interview with The Independent newspaper, discussed the events after the game between the two sides in October. United won 2-0 that day, at Old Trafford, but the game was followed by a now notorious food fight which saw Ferguson's clothes covered in soup and pizza. The sides meet again at Highbury on 1 February. "In the tunnel Wenger was criticising my players, calling them cheats, so I told him to leave them alone and behave himself," Ferguson said on Saturday. "He ran at me with hands raised saying 'what do you want to do about it?' "To not apologise for the behaviour of the players to another manager is unthinkable. It's a disgrace, but I don't expect Wenger to ever apologise, he's that type of person." Those allegations were put to Wenger after Saturday's game at Bolton, which Arsenal lost to slip 10 points behind Chelsea in the title race. At first he said only: "I've always been consistent with that story and told you nothing happened. "If he has to talk, he talks. If he wants to make a newspaper article, he makes a newspaper article. "He doesn't interest me and doesn't matter to me at all. I will never answer to any provocation from him any more. "He does what he likes in England anyway. He can go abroad one day and see how it is." But later on Saturday, according to The Independent, Wenger spoke to a smaller group of reporters and expanded on his reaction. "I have no diplomatic relations with him," the Arsenal boss is quoted as saying. "What I don't understand is that he does what he wants and you (the press) are all at his feet. "The situation (concerning the food fight) has been judged and there is a game going on in a month. "The managers have a responsibility to protect the game before the game. But in England you are only punished for what you say after the game. "Now the whole story starts again. I don't go into that game. We play football. I am a football manager and I love football above all ... no matter what people say." Reminded that Ferguson called him "a disgrace", Wenger added: "I don't respond to anything. In England you have a good phrase. It is 'bringing the game into disrepute'. "But that is not only after a game, it is as well before a game." Ferguson had also claimed that United chief executive David Gill and Arsenal vice-chairman David Dein had agreed at boardroom level not to discuss the incident in public. But Ferguson added: "In the ensuing weeks all you got was a diatribe from Arsenal about being kicked off the pitch and all that nonsense. Gill phoned Dein three times to complain but nothing was done. "The return is on 1 February and they will come out with another diatribe. "David Gill and I feel we should set the record straight because Arsenal have not written to us to apologise and we would not let that happen here." Meanwhile, the League Managers Association have offered to act as peacemakers in the hope of resolving the on-going row. During that stormy game in October, United striker Ruud van Nistelrooy caught Arsenal's Ashley Cole with one particularly strong tackle. Wenger later accused Van Nistelrooy of "cheating" and was fined Â£15,000 and "severely reprimanded" by the Football Association. Ferguson admitted on Saturday that Van Nistelrooy's tackle, which earned the Dutchman a ban, "could have given (Cole) a serious injury", but he believes Arsenal were the main aggressors. "Wenger is always complaining the match was not played in the right spirit," he added. "They are the worst losers of all time, they don't know how to lose. Maybe it is just Manchester United, they don't lose many games to other teams. "We tend to forget the worst disciplinary record of all time was Arsenal's up until last season. In fairness it has improved and now they are seen as paragons of virtue. "But to Wenger it never happens, it is all some dream or nightmare." Return to results

World tour for top video gamers World tour for top video gamers Two UK gamers are about to embark on a world tour as part of the most lucrative-ever global games tournament. Aaron Foster and David Treacy have won the right to take part in a tournament offering $1m in total prize money. The cash will be handed out over 10 separate competitions in a continent-hopping contest organised by the Cyberathlete Professional League. As part of their prize the pair will have their travel costs paid to ensure they can get to the different bouts. The CPL World Tour kicks off in mid-February and the first leg will be in Istanbul. All ten bouts of the tournament will be played throughout 2005, each one in a different country. At each stop $50,000 in prize money will be up for grabs. The tournament champion for each leg of the CPL World Tour will walk away with a $15,000 prize. The winner of the grand final will get a prize purse of $150,000 from a total pot of $500,000. Winners of each stage of the tour automatically get a place at the next stop. The world tour stops are open to any keen gamer that registers. Online registration for the first stop opens this weekend. Some pro-players are winning a spot at the tour destinations through qualifying events organised by CPL partners. Winners at these qualifiers get seeded higher in the elimination parts of each tournament. Mr Foster and Mr Treacy get the chance to attend the World Tour as members of the UK's Four-Kings gaming clan. Towards the end of 2004 Four-Kings staged a series of online Painkiller competitions to reveal the UK's top players of the PC game. The best eight players met face-to-face in a special elimination event in late December where Mr Foster and Mr Tracey proved their prowess at Painkiller. As part of their prize the pair also get a contract with Four-Kings Intel which is one of the UK's few pro-gaming teams. "There are a lot of people who take gaming very seriously and support their local or national team with the same passion as any other sport," said Simon Bysshe who filmed the event for Four-Kings and Intel. More than 80,000 people have downloaded the movie of the tournament highlights. "Professional gaming is here to stay and will only grow in popularity," he said. Comments are closed for this article.
Xbox 2 may be unveiled in summer Xbox 2 may be unveiled in summer Details of the next generation of Microsoft's Xbox games console - codenamed Xenon - will most likely be unveiled in May, according to reports. It was widely expected that gamers would get a sneak preview of Xbox's successor at the Game Developers Conference (GDC) in March. But a Microsoft spokeswoman confirmed that it would not be at GDC. Sony, Microsoft and Nintendo are all expected to release their more powerful machines in the next 18 months. The next Xbox console is expected to go on sale at the end of the year, but very few details about it have been released. It is thought that the machine may be unveiled at the Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) in Los Angeles, which takes place in May, according to a Online News news agency report. E3 concentrates on showing off the latest in gaming to publishers, marketers and retailers. The GDC is aimed more at game developers. Microsoft chief, Bill Gates, used the GDC event to unveil the original Xbox five years ago. Since its launch, Microsoft has sold 19.9 million units worldwide. At the Consumer Electronics Show earlier this year, there was very little mention of the next generation gaming machine. In his keynote speech, Mr Gates only referred to it as playing an essential part of his vision of the digital lifestyle. But the battle between the rival consoles to win gamers' hearts and thumbs will be extremely hard-fought. Sony has traditionally dominated the console market with its PlayStation 2. But earlier this year, Microsoft said it had reached a European milestone, selling five million consoles since its European launch in March 2002. Hit games like Halo 2, which was released in November, helped to buoy the sales figures. Gamers are looking forward to the next generation of machines because they will have much more processing and graphical power. They are also likely to pack in more features and technologies that make them more central as entertainment and communications hubs. Although details of PlayStation 3, Xenon, and Nintendo's so-called Revolution, are yet to be finalised, developers are already working on titles. Rory Armes, studio general manager for games giant Electronic Arts (EA) in Europe, recently told the Online News News website in an interview that EA was beginning to get a sense of the capabilities of the new machines. Microsoft had delivered development kits to EA, but he said the company was still waiting on Sony and Nintendo's kits. But, he added, the PlayStation 3 was rumoured to have "a little more under the hood [than Xbox 2]". Comments are closed for this article.
2D Metal Slug offers retro fun 2D Metal Slug offers retro fun Like some drill sergeant from the past, Metal Slug 3 is a wake-up call to today's gamers molly-coddled with slick visuals and fancy trimmings. With its hand-animated sprites and 2D side-scrolling, this was even considered retro when released in arcades four years ago. But a more frantic shooter you will not find at the end of your joypad this year. And yes, that includes Halo 2. Simply choose your grunt and wade through five 2D side-scrolling levels of the most hectic video game blasting you will ever encounter. It is also the toughest game you are likely to play, as hordes of enemies and few lives pile the pressure on. Players must battle soldiers, snowmen, zombies, giant crabs and aliens, not to mention the huge, screen-filling bosses that guard each of the five levels. The shoot-anything-that-moves gameplay is peppered with moments of old-school genius. Fans of robotic gastropods should note the title refers, instead, to the vast array of vehicles on offer in a game stuffed with bizarre hardware. Tanks, jets and submarines can be commandeered, as well as cannon-toting camels, elephants and ostriches - more weaponry on offer than in an acre of Iraq. Doling out justice is a joy thanks to ultra responsive controls, and while this is a tough nut to crack, it is addictive enough to have you gagging for that one last go. And at a mere Â£20, Metal Slug 3 is as cheap as sliced, fried spuds, as the man says. Of course, most of you will ignore this, lacking as it does the visual fireworks of modern blasters. But at a time when blockbuster titles offer only a fresh lick of paint in favour of real innovation, Metal Slug 3 is a fresh gasp of air from an era when the Xbox was not even a twinkle in Bill Gates' eye.

American chamber president warns against further unilateral tax changes American chamber president warns against further unilateral tax changes Peter Keegan, president of the American Chamber of Commerce Ireland. On income taxes, he said âemployees and employers simply cannot afford to pay any moreâ. Photograph: Brenda Fitzsimons/The Online News The collapse of the Bord GÃ¡is Energy sale will not leave a funding gap in the Governmentâs job stimulus package, the Minister for Finance has said. Before the American Chamber of Commerce Ireland Thanksgiving lunch yesterday, Michael Noonan said the Government had not over-valued Bord GÃ¡is Energy despite a lack of favourable bids. While the sale of the State-owned enterprise had attracted significant interest, none of the bids was of acceptable value. âWe are in no rush to sell,â he said. âExpenditure was well below budget and taxes are up so we can get the â¬110 million from that. Under the terms of Irelandâs â¬85 billion rescue package, it agreed to tax rises, structural reforms and the sale of State assets. Half the money raised from State assets would go towards paying national debt, while the remainder would be put towards job stimulus programmes. Mr Noonan defended the Governmentâs decision to remove the âstateless companyâ tax loophole, saying the loophole did not benefit Ireland in any way and caused âheavy reputational damage at US congress hearingsâ. US Chamber of Commerce Ireland president Peter Keegan implored the Government not to make any more unilateral tax changes, saying investors crave certainty. âGiven current global events, we believe it would be wise for Ireland to only make changes in relation to global tax matters, in the context of international changes rather than any unilateral action on Irelandâs part,â he said. Mr Noonan confirmed that there would be no further unilateral action, but said Ireland would fall in line with any international tax reforms. Mr Keegan told the event there were still challenges in the domestic economy, ânot least the continuing deficit in the public finances and the extremely high level of public debtâ. He said income taxes had reached saturation point, adding that âemployees and employers simply cannot afford to pay any moreâ. Return to results
Anelka apologises for criticism Anelka apologises for criticism Manchester City striker Nicolas Anelka has issued an apology for criticising the ambitions of the club. Anelka was quoted in a French newspaper as saying he would like to play in the Champions League for a bigger club. But chairman John Wardle said: "I've spoken to Nicolas and he's apologised for anything that might have been mistakenly taken from the French press. "We are a big club. Nicolas told me that he agrees with me that we are a big club." Wardle was speaking at the club's annual general meeting, where he also confirmed the club had not received any bids for the former Arsenal and Real Madrid striker. The club still owe French club PSG Â£5m from the purchase of Anelka in May 2002. He has been linked with a move to Barcelona and Liverpool, and Reds skipper Steven Gerrard also revealed he is an admirer from his time on loan at Anfield. But Wardle added: "There's been no bids for Nicolas Anelka. No-one has come to me and said I would like to buy Nicolas Anelka. "If a bid comes in for Nicolas Anelka I will speak to the board and then speak to Kevin Keegan. "If there was a bid and it was a bid of substance and worth taking then between us we'd decide. "We still owe some money on Nicolas which we have clear out, so it would have to be above that." Wardle did stress that the club was not inviting any offers for England winger Shaun Wright-Phillips. He added: "I've no intention of selling Shaun Wright-Phillips. "If someone comes with a silly bid I'll have to discuss it. "But we're not putting him on the shelf to sell. He is the heart and soul of this club and has his heart and sole in this club, and he would be very upset if I put him in the shop window. "He was an academy kid here, he's just signed a new four-year deal, I don't think he'd do that unless he wanted to play for Manchester City Football Club." City recently announced debts of Â£62m, but Wardle confirmed they would try and find funds to bring in players in the January transfer window. He said: "Like Kevin I'd like to see some players come in. We've got to see what we can do - whether it's a on a Bosman or not. "We will try to be creative to generate some funds. But maybe we have to start looking at clubs like Everton and Bolton to see how they have been dealing in the transfer market and do a similar type of thing." Comments are closed for this article.
Apple attacked over sources row Apple attacked over sources row Civil liberties group the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) has joined a legal fight between three US online journalists and Apple. Apple wants the reporters to reveal 20 sources used for stories which leaked information about forthcoming products, including the Mac Mini. The EFF, representing the reporters, has asked California's Superior court to stop Apple pursuing the sources. It argues that the journalists are protected by the American constitution. The EFF says the case threatens the basic freedoms of the press. Apple is particularly keen to find the source for information about an unreleased product code-named Asteroid and has asked the journalists' e-mail providers to hand over communications relevant to that. "Rather than confronting the issue of reporter's privilege head-on, Apple is going to the journalist's ISPs for his e-mails," said EFF lawyer Kurt Opsahl. "This undermines a fundamental First Amendment right that protects all reporters. "If the court lets Apple get away with this, and exposes the confidences gained by these reporters, potential confidential sources will be deterred from providing information to the media and the public will lose a vital outlet for independent news, analysis and commentary," he said. The case began in December 2004 when Apple asked a local Californian court to get the journalists to reveal their sources for articles published on websites AppleInsider.com and PowerPage.org. Apple also sent requested information from the Nfox.com, the internet service provider of PowerPage's publisher Jason O-Grady. As well as looking at how far corporations can go in preventing information from being published, the case will also examine whether online journalists have the same privileges and protections as those writing for newspapers and magazines. The EFF has gained some powerful allies in its legal battle with Apple, including Professor Tom Goldstein, former dean of the Journalism School at the University of California and Dan Gillmor, a well-known Silicon Valley journalist. Apple was not immediately available for comment. Comments are closed for this article.
Apple sues to stop product leaks Apple sues to stop product leaks Computer firm Apple has issued a lawsuit to prevent online leaks of information about future products. The lawsuit, against an unidentified individual, comes just weeks before the MacWorld conference in San Francisco, used to showcase new products. The complaint said an "unidentified individual... has recently misappropriated and disseminated confidential information". The lawsuit was filed with the Santa Clara California Superior Court. Apple is famously secretive about its future product launches while Apple users are equally famous for speculating about new technology from the company. Fans have speculated in recent weeks about the possibility of a new type of iPod being announced at the MacWorld conference. Apple said in the seven-page complaint, filed on 13 December, that it did not know the "true names or capacities, whether individual, associate, corporate or otherwise," of the defendants. The company said it would amend the complaint once they had discovered the names of those who had allegedly leaked information. It is not the first time Apple has sued people who have posted information about future products on the internet. In December 2002, Apple sued a former contractor who allegedly posted online drawings, images and engineering details of the company's PowerMac G4 computer. In a statement, Apple said of the current lawsuit: "Apple has filed a civil complaint against unnamed individuals who we believe stole our trade secrets and posted detailed information about an unannounced Apple product on the internet."

Ask Jeeves joins web log market Ask Jeeves joins web log market Ask Jeeves has bought the Bloglines website to improve the way it handles content from web journals or blogs. The Bloglines site has become hugely popular as it gives users one place in which to read, search and share all the blogs they are interested in. Ask Jeeves said it was not planning to change Bloglines but would use the 300 million articles it has archived to round out its index of the web. How much Ask Jeeves paid for Bloglines was not revealed. Bloglines has become popular because it lets users build a list of the blogs they want to follow without having to visit each journal site individually. To do this it makes use of a technology known as Really Simple Syndication (RSS) that many blogs have adopted to let other sites know when new entries are made on their journals. The acquisition follows similar moves by other search sites. Google acquired Pyra Labs, makers of the Blogger software, in 2003. In 2004 MSN introduced its own blog system and Yahoo has tweaked its technology to do a better job of handling blog entries. Jim Lanzone, vice president of search properties at Ask Jeeves in the US, said it did not acquire Bloglines just to get a foothold in the blog publishing world. He said Ask Jeeves was much more interested in helping people find information they were looking for rather than helping them write it. "The universe of readers is vastly larger than the universe of writers," he said. Mr Lanzone said the acquisition would sit well with Ask's My Jeeves service which lets people customise their own web experience and build up a personal collection of useful links. "Search engines are about discovering information for the first time and RSS is the ideal way to keep track of and monitor those sites," he said. It would also help drive information and entries from blogs to the portals that Ask Jeeves operates. There would be no instant sweeping changes to Bloglines, said Mr Lanzone. "Our intent is to take our time to figure out the right business model not to try to monetise it right away," he said. Though Mr Lanzone added that Ask Jeeves would be helping organise the database of 300m blog entries Bloglines holds with its own net indexing technology. "Being able to search the blogosphere as one corpus of information will be very useful in its own right," said Mr Lanzone. Rumours about the acquisition were broken by the Napsterization weblog which said it got the hint from Ask Jeeves insiders.
Aviva announces 5.2% rise in its health insurance plans Aviva announces 5.2% rise in its health insurance plans Price increases across range of plans will be effective from the beginning of next year Health insurance with Aviva will cost thousands of families more than â¬ 120 more each year after the company announced premium price increases of an average of 5.2 per cent this morning. Health insurance with Aviva will cost thousands of families more than â¬ 120 more each year after the company announced premium price increases of an average of 5.2 per cent this morning. The price increases across a range of its plans will be effective from the beginning of next year and come just days after Glo Health announced similar increases on its policies. Aviva said it regretted that it has had to impose its latest increase blaming the impact of recent changes in Government policy on public hospital bed charges and the increase in the cost of claims which, it said, had been driven upwards by âthe shift in the age composition of our customer baseâ. Last Friday evening, the Government informed health insurers of its decision not to reduce the rates set out in legislation passed by the Oireachtas last July which allows privately insured patients to be charged for the use of a public bed in a public hospital. This means that from the beginning of January, patients with private health insurance will be charged up to â¬ 813 per night when they occupy a public bed in a public hospital. The current charge is â¬ 75 per night. Aviva said the new charge âdirectly increases the cost of providing cover for our membersâ. Its chief executive Alison Burns claimed the company was âdeeply conscious of the struggle our customers face to maintain their health coverâ and she said it had taken the decision not to increase the price of some of its entry level plans. âThose due to renew in January and February already face premium increases as a result of the governmentâs decision to reduce tax relief. With this in mind, we have held our increase to the absolute minimum of an average of 5.2 per cent.â She added that Aviva would have to keep premium prices under review over the coming months. âRecent government policy changes have severely disrupted the health insurance market and their impact on customer behaviour remains to be seen. Our first obligation as a responsible regulated insurer is to make sure we are in a position to pay the claims of our customers when they get sick,â she stressed. .

Ban hits Half-Life 2 pirates hard Ban hits Half-Life 2 pirates hard About 20,000 people have been banned from playing the Half-Life 2 game. Game maker Valve shut down the online accounts of the players because it had evidence that their copy of the game had been obtained illegally. Copies of Half-Life 2 had been circulating on file-sharing systems soon after it was officially released. Experts said the success of the Half-Life 2 anti-piracy system might tempt other game makers into creating their own version. Half-Life 2 was officially released on 16 November but before gamers could get to grips with the long-awaited title they were forced to authenticate their copy of the game online. Authentication involved setting up an account with Valve's gaming community system called Steam and letting that check which copy of the game was being run. In a statement detailing the banning of the accounts Valve said this system helped identify who had got hold of pirated copies. "The method used was extremely easy for Valve to trace and confirm, and so there is no question that the accounts disabled were used to try and illegally obtain Half-Life 2," read the statement. Valve spokesman Doug Lombardi said that the company had not yet released sales figures for the game and would not say what proportion of all Steam players the 20,000 represented. One effect of Steam's popularity has been to limit the copies of the game sold in shops and artificially depress the game's ranking in the top ten. Even so the title debuted at No 3 in the UK charts. Valve also said that a small number of accounts were closed because people were using stolen credit cards to buy copies of the game or were using stolen Steam accounts. Some of those who have been banned by the move protested their innocence in the online forums on the main Steam site and said they were being punished for what other people did with their account. Some contributors to the forums wondered if the action might force more piracy as people tried to get hold of successive copies of the game to keep ahead of Valve's anti-piracy actions. In its statement Valve also said that rumours that it distributed fake Half-Life 2 keys, copies of the game or instructions on how to hack the game, just to catch pirates and cheats were false. The company said: "The hack came from the 'community' as do they all." It added that most of those banned simply tried to use copies of Half-Life 2 circulating on file-swapping systems such as Bit Torrent rather than use hacks to get around the need for CD keys. Rob Fahey, editor of online news site gamesindustry.biz, said the mass banning showed off the power of the Steam system. Before now, he said, it has been hard for game makers to do anything about piracy once the game was being played. "But with this, Valve is taking really effective steps against people using illegitimate copies of Half-Life 2," he said. If Steam proves effective at cutting the piracy of games to a minimum, said Mr Fahey, other game makers may be tempted to set up copycat systems. "It's not hard to see a point in the near future when every publisher wants you to run an application on your system purely to allow you to play their games," he said. This could mean that computers get cluttered with poorly written Steam-type systems that are used to batter people with adverts. Unless game firms were careful, he said, they could face a backlash from consumers who soon get tired of maintaining different accounts for every game they play. Comments are closed for this article.
Beckham virus spotted on the net Beckham virus spotted on the net Virus writers are trading on interest in David Beckham to distribute their malicious wares. Messages are circulating widely that purport to have evidence of the England captain in a compromising position. But anyone visiting the website mentioned in the message will not see pictures of Mr Beckham but will have their computer infected by a virus. The pernicious program opens a backdoor on a computer so it can be controlled remotely by malicious hackers. The appearance of the Beckham Windows trojan is just another example in a long line of viruses that trade on interest in celebrities in an attempt to fuel their spread. Tennis player Anna Kournikova, popstars Britney Spears and Avril Lavigne as well as Arnold Schwarzenegger have all been used in the past to try to con people into opening infected files. The huge amount of interest in Mr Beckham and his private life and the large number of messages posted to discussion groups on the net might mean that the malicious program catches a lot of people out. "The public's appetite for salacious gossip about the private life of the Beckhams might lead some into an unpleasant computer infection," said Graham Cluley from anti-virus firm Sophos. Simply opening the message will not infect a user's PC. But anyone visiting the website it mentions who then downloads and opens the fake image file stored on that site will be infected. The program that installs itself is called the Hackarmy trojan and it tries to recruit PCs into so-called 'bot networks that are often used to distribute spam mail messages or to launch attacks across the web. Computers running Microsoft Windows 95, 98, 2000, NT and XP are vulnerable to this trojan. Many anti-virus programs have been able to detect this trojan since it first appeared early this year and have regularly been updated to catch new variants. Return to results
Bosvelt optimistic over new deal Bosvelt optimistic over new deal Manchester City's Paul Bosvelt will find out "within a month" whether he is to be offered a new one-year deal. The 34-year-old Dutch midfielder is out of contract in the summer and, although his age may count against him, he feels he can play on for another season. "I told the club I would like to stay for one more year. They promised me an answer within the next month so I am waiting to see," he said. "The main concern is my age but I think I have proved I am fit enough. Bosvelt joined City from Feyenoord in 2003 and at first he struggled to adapt to life in England. But his professionalism and dedication impressed manager Kevin Keegan. "He realised the pace of the game was faster than anything he was used to but he drove himself back into the team. He is an unsung hero," said Keegan. Comments are closed for this article.
Boundaries between the funny folk and money folk dissolve at Kilkenomics Festival Boundaries between the funny folk and money folk dissolve at Kilkenomics Festival At the Kilkenomics Optimistic Economics Brunch Show in Kilkenny yesterday were (from left) Bill Black, Louise Cooper and Peter Antonioni. Photograph: Dylan Vaughan âLeave the jokes alone!â warns comedian Karl Spain , after former US banking regulator Bill Black upstages him with a gag on the Friday night of Kilkenomics. âBecause thereâll be no economic theory coming from me.â The spirited comedy and economics festival, started by David McWilliams and Richard Cooke , usually has clearly defined boundaries between its funny folk and its money folk. This was a troubling demarcation dispute. âThere were union tickets coming out,â admits fellow comic Dermot Whelan the next day. The comedians, he suggests, nearly walked off the job. The highflying economists found at Kilkenomics already have a maverick disposition. This is clear at Fridayâs SAS Young Economist of the Year competition where the aforementioned Black, one of the judges, refers to a âdrug-crazed roommateâ in an anecdote and Nobel-tipped behavioural economist Dan Ariely explains the concept of scarcity with reference to overweight elephant seals who âsometimes kill the females when they copulate.â âI really hope thereâs a point to this,â says worried compere Colm OâRegan, before fine-tuning the story for the school-going audience: âWhen a male seal and female seal like each other very muchâ¦â These young economists are the future (I briefly meet one impressive young winner, Joseph Morrin). A little latter, Colin Murphyâs excellent play Guaranteed! rakes through the recent past. Five besuited actors negotiate dialogue laced with real-life speeches and Dail discussions from Irelandâs last boom/bust cycle. I feel almost nostalgic and have to stop myself joining in on the bits I know - âThe fundamentals are soundâ âThereâll be a soft landingâ âDonât talk down the economyâ. Yes, Kilkenomics is sometimes like a financial Panto. For example, whenever the gleefully villainous stripey-trousered US pundit Max Keiser takes to the stage, I get an urge to shout âHeâs behind you!â Chatting about the future of money at The Hole in The Wall with ULâs Dr Stephen Kinsella and University of Illinois professor Deirdre McCloskey, Keiser engages in some shouty populism aimed at no one in particular. âYouâre being lied to!â he says, to whoops of appreciation from the audience. Keiser has recently been an advocate of the digital currency Bitcoin. âThereâs a flying column of Bitcoin enthusiasts here,â observes compere David McWilliams. The others on the panel are sceptical about this currency. âBoo!â say the audience. âLetâs get rid of academics!â says Keiser. They cheer terrifyingly (first they came for McCloskey and Kinsella and I did not speak out). Things are more chucklesome at the âJargon Bustersâ event where comedians and economists compete to explain economic terms. (âAnimal spirits,â are explained by Karl Spain thusly: âEvery Christmas we get our dog drunkâ). After a depressing discussion of âcrony capitalism,â Dermot Whelan dramatically rips up the card itâs written on. The next card, picked at random, reads âcreative destruction.â âThat was âcreative destructionâ,â says Bill Black to a round of applause, again rousing the ire of Spain. While David McWilliams says the themes at this year Kilkenomics are less specific and more universal than before, thereâs still an eager turnout for Saturdayâs âBoom or Bubble: the Future of Irish Propertyâ.

Camera phones are 'must-haves' Camera phones are 'must-haves' Four times more mobiles with cameras in them will be sold in Europe by the end of 2004 than last year, says a report from analysts Gartner. Globally, the number sold will reach 159 million, an increase of 104%. The report predicts that nearly 70% of all mobile phones sold will have a built-in camera by 2008. Improving imaging technology in mobiles is making them an increasingly "must-have" buy. In Europe, cameras on mobiles can take 1.3 megapixel images. But in Japan and Asia Pacific, where camera phone technology is much more advanced, mobiles have already been released which can take 3.2 megapixel images. Japan still dominates mobile phone technology, and the uptake there is huge. By 2008, according to Gartner, 95% of all mobiles sold there will have cameras on them. Camera phones had some teething problems when they were first launched as people struggled with poor quality images and uses for them, as well as the complexity and expense of sending them via MMS (Multimedia Messaging Services). This has changed in the last 18 months. Handset makers have concentrated on trying to make phones easier to use. Realising that people like to use their camera phones in different ways, they have introduced more design features, like rotating screens and viewfinders, removable memory cards and easier controls to send picture messages. Mobile companies have introduced more ways for people to share photos with other people. These have included giving people easier ways to publish them on websites, or mobile blogs - moblogs. But the report suggests that until image quality increases more, people will not be interested in printing out pictures at kiosks. Image sensor technology inside cameras phones is improving. The Gartner report suggests that by mid-2005, it is likely that the image resolution of most camera phones will be more than two megapixels. Consumer digital cameras images range from two to four megapixels in quality, and up to six megapixels on a high-end camera. But a lot of work is being done to make camera phones more like digital cameras. Some handsets already feature limited zoom capability, and manufacturers are looking into technological improvements that will let people take more photos in poorly-lit conditions, like nightclubs. Other developments include wide-angle modes, basic editing features, and better sensors and processors for recording film clips. Images from camera phones have even made it into the art world. An exhibition next month in aid of the charity Mencap, will feature snaps taken from the camera phones of top artists. The exhibition, Fonetography, will feature images taken by photographers David Bailey, Rankin and Nan Goldin, and artists Sir Peter Blake, Tracey Emin and Jack Vettriano. But some uses for them have worried many organisations. Intel, Samsung, the UK's Foreign Office and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories in the US, have decided to ban camera phones from their buildings for fear of sensitive information being snapped and leaked. Many schools, fitness centres and local councils have also banned them over fears about privacy and misuse. Italy's information commissioner has also voiced concern and has issued guidelines on where and how the phones can be used. But camera phone fears have not dampened the manufacturers' profits. According to recent figures, Sony Ericsson's profits tripled in the third-quarter because of new camera phones. Over 60% of mobiles sold during the three months through to September featured integrated cameras, it said. Return to results
Campaign warns of dangers of gonorrhoea as cases rise by 33% Campaign warns of dangers of gonorrhoea as cases rise by 33% Men were five times more likely to contract the disease, and slightly over half of the cases reported were men who had sex with men. Images An information campaign warning of the dangers of gonorrhoea is being developed for gay men and young heterosexuals in response to an alarming rise in the incidence of the disease. Health professionals say the increase in gonorrhoea cases in the Dublin area and the southeast is a cause of concern. The number of people diagnosed with the sexually transmitted disease grew by 33 per cent between 2011 and 2012, and the HSEâs Health Protection Surveillance Centre says the trend has continued into this year. The centre says it is particularly concerned at the growth in cases in the HSEâs eastern region, where cases have doubled in two years. In response, public health officials in the HSE set up a gonorrhoea control group last year to investigate the trend and develop ways of countering it. The groupâs work focused on the Dublin area but was expanded to include the southeast due to a rise in cases there in the first two months of this year. The group looked at more than 200 cases reported in the two areas in the first quarter of the year. This revealed the average age of those presenting as 26 years, with men more than five times more likely to contract the disease. Slightly over half the cases were men who had sex with men (MSM), 44 per cent were male heterosexuals and 16 per cent were female heterosexuals. Most of MSM cases were in the eastern region and almost half involved people born outside Ireland, notably central or eastern Europe and Latin America. Three-quarters were in people aged 25 and older, and 13 per cent were HIV-positive. The heterosexual cases were significantly younger and mostly among people aged under 25. Specialists say such occurrences were higher than anticipated. Comments are closed for this article.
Campbell lifts lid on United feud Campbell lifts lid on United feud Arsenal's Sol Campbell has called the rivalry between Manchester United and the Gunners "bitter and personal". Past encounters have stirred up plenty of ill-feeling between the sides and they meet again at Highbury on Tuesday. "It is just more bitter and personal against United," the defender told The Online News newspaper. "There's an edge. "After all that has happened, if we beat them it will be one of our sweetest ever wins, especially because of how we lost to them up there." Last October, Arsenal lost 2-0 at Old Trafford, which ended a record 49-match unbeaten league run and sparked a mini-crisis, with the Gunners winning only three of their next 10 games. "It had a psychological impact on us, but again because of the way we were defeated," added the 30-year-old, referring to a controversial penalty award for United's first goal. "That was far more upsetting, losing like that, because they just seem to get away with it. You try and balance out over the course of a season but I've had so many rough decisions against them you begin to wonder." With tensions spilling over afterwards - United boss Sir Alex Ferguson was allegedly pelted with pizza in the players' tunnel - there is little surprise that so much is riding on the return encounter on. "Everyone at Arsenal has been waiting for this game," said Campbell. "We are up for this one." Speaking on his long-term plans, Campbell signalled his intent to move abroad before he turns 35. "I'm 30 now and in five years' time I won't be in this country - that's definite. "Italy looks good to me because it would suit my kind of football. Spain is an option but the idea of tasting a new culture and learning another language excites me the most. I'm starting a little with French, of course." Return to results
Cantillon: Noonan unlikely to take big bite out of Apple Cantillon: Noonan unlikely to take big bite out of Apple Finance Bill not expected to prompt jump in Irish corporation tax receipts The Apple subsidiary in Cork differed from its fellow tech giants in that it apparently was able to book non-US profits here while being managed and controlled from the US We will have to wait until next weekâs Finance Bill to see the detail concerning the Minister for Finance Michael Noonanâs pledge to get rid of Irish-registered companies that are âstatelessâ for tax residency purposes. However, it is unlikely any measure that emerges will see a jump in Irish corporation tax receipts, or indeed those of the USA. While many of the behemoths of the technological age have operations here that are their key presence outside the Americas, getting rid of the scenario that allowed Cork-based Apple subsidiary Apple Sales International to remain stateless for the purposes of tax calculations is unlikely to affect the Irish subsidiaries of Google , Facebook , Microsoft and so on. The Apple subsidiary differed from its fellow tech giants in that it apparently was able to book non-US profits here while being managed and controlled from the US. The US didnât tax it because it was an Irish company, and Ireland didnât tax it because it was managed and controlled from outside Ireland, (making it non-resident for Irish tax purposes). The US could presumably have changed its rules so that companies such as Apple Sales International â non-US companies managed from the US and ultimately owned by a US parent â would become resident in the US for tax purposes. Instead, however, the politicians in Washington pointed the finger at Ireland, prompting the budget promise by Noonan. If, as Barry OâLeary of IDA Ireland has suggested, the trend in the international taxation regime debate is towards an increased alignment between taxation and substance, that can only be good for Irelandâs corporation tax receipts. If the US, or the global community, manages to close down the sort of practice that channels profits onwards towards tax havens, the Irish exchequer could turn out to be the major winner. Instead of the profits going to Irish-registered holding companies that were tax resident in Bermuda or wherever, the profits could become taxable here. At 12.5 per cent. .

Charlton 1-2 Liverpool Charlton 1-2 Liverpool Fernando Morientes grabbed his first Premiership goal as Liverpool earned all three points at Charlton with a vintage second-half display. Inspired by former Anfield ace Danny Murphy, the hosts took a deserved first-half lead, Murphy swinging in a corner for Shaun Bartlett to head home. But Liverpool, who had struck the bar twice, hit back when Spaniard Morientes rifled in from 20 yards out. John Arne Riise slotted the winner after a neat pass from Luis Garcia. The teams started with virtually identical league records and there was little to separate them on the pitch early on. Liverpool where unlucky not to score when a Garcia shot was spilled by Dean Kiely into the path Steven Gerrard, whose shot bounced back off the crossbar. But then the hosts went in front, Murphy's 20th-minute corner headed home powerfully by Bartlett. Gerrard forced a sharp save from Kiely shortly afterwards as Liverpool looked to redress the balance. And the visiting captain almost set up an equaliser when he cut a clever cross back to Morientes, who saw his shot saved from two yards out. The visitors continued to press forward on the restart. And Riise came within inches of the breakthrough when he latched onto a superb ball from Garcia and hit a rasping drive, which Kiely tipped on to the Charlton bar. Morientes finally found the back of the net when he buried a left-foot shot into the top corner after Charlton had failed to clear. Djimi Traore had to time his challenge well to deny Murphy an instant reply. But Liverpool were in the ascendancy now, with Morientes causing plenty of problems. The Spaniard went close himself, before releasing Riise, who cooly finished with a trademark low drive. Morientes departed to great ovation from the visiting fans, as Charlton's biggest home attendance for 10 years tasted disappointment. - Liverpool boss Rafael Benitez: "We played a very good game with a high tempo and lots of confidence. "We have seen the mentality of the players, the team spirit and the quality we have. "I think we had two or three clear chances in the first half but conceded the goal. In the second half we controlled the game." - Charlton boss Alan Curbishley: "In the first half it was quite even but the second half they totally dominated and looked such a strong side. "We played on Saturday while they&#191;ve had a week's rest but you have got to get on with it. "I'm really disappointed because if we'd held out for a draw it would have been a great bonus for us."

Choice Ireland calls for overhaul of how State views pregnant women Choice Ireland calls for overhaul of how State views pregnant women Pro Life Campaign says Hiqa report shows story was never really about abortion Dr Ruth Cullen of the Pro Life Campaign: said The Online News and some politicians had rushed to judgment on the Savita Halappanavar case. The Pro Life Campaign said it hoped the Health Information and Quality Authority report would lead to the implementation of procedures that are âin the interests of proper patient careâ. Dr Ruth Cullen of the campaign said The Online News and some politicians had rushed to judgment on the Savita Halappanavar case. âWe now know from todayâs Hiqa report and earlier reports that this story was never really about abortion and that the key issues in the death of Ms Halappanavar were basic deficiencies in patient care and the catalogue of failures in monitoring and recognising the grave risk to her life.â Choice Ireland called for the implementation of the reportâs recommendations as well as an overhaul of how the State viewed pregnant women and their healthcare. Its spokeswoman Stephanie Lord said: âThis report will yet again send shivers down the spine of pregnant women in Ireland . It is as bizarre as it is unacceptable that State policy compels women to carry pregnancies to term and canât even guarantee them appropriate maternity care.â Return to results
Concern where responsibility will lie for filling capital holes revealed by stress tests Concern where responsibility will lie for filling capital holes revealed by stress tests Euro group chairman Jeroen Dijsselbloem listens to Luxembourgâs Finance Minister Luc Frieden during an euro zone finance ministers meeting in Luxembourg yesterday. Photograph: Francois Lenoir/Online News. Governments are likely to meet any capital shortfalls uncovered by next yearâs banking stress tests, though only after private options and bail-in rules are implemented, euro group chairman Jeroen Dijsselbloem said yesterday following a euro group meeting in Luxembourg . Finance ministers and government officials of the 17 euro states discussed the issue of âbackstopsâ yesterday amid concern about where responsibility will lie for filling any capital holes revealed by next yearâs European stress tests. With the banking resolution and recovery directive (BRRD), which sets out a clear hierarchy of creditors to be bailed-in in the event of a bank wind-down, not scheduled to come into effect until 2015 at the earliest, ministers discussed possible backstop mechanisms. âThere was broad support for maintaining the agreed sequence of backstop arrangements,â Mr Dijsselbloem said following the meeting. Public money That would involve private sector solutions in the first case before public money would be engaged, he said, adding that âif the state couldnât afford to contribute then the ESM would come into playâ . Discussions are expected to intensify at todayâs meeting which will be attended by German finance minister Wolfgang Schauble , who missed yesterdayâs euro group meeting because of German coalition talks. Germany is staunchly resistant to a single-resolution fund to deal with troubled banks, instead favouring a network of national resolution funds. The Germany position is supported by Finland and the Netherlands . âFor now we should rely on national backstops, meaning that if needed national governments would step in,â Finlandâs finance minister Jutta Urpilainen said yesterday. British concerns over the single-supervisory mechanism, the first so-called âpillarâ of banking union which provides the legal basis for the ECB taking over supervisory authority of banks, subsided yesterday, with UK sources indicating that Britain would give the go-ahead to the deal today. Britain is understood to have received assurances that voting rights would be preserved. Meanwhile, Mr Dijsselbloem played down claims by ECB executive board member Jorg Asmussen earlier in the day that Greece would face a fiscal gap of â¬5-6 billion next year.

Confidence reached a six-year high in September Confidence reached a six-year high in September The Consumer Market Monitor shows 4,735 used cars were sold in September, an increase of 60 per cent on September last year. Photograph: Online News Consumer confidence reached a six-year high in September, despite concerns about the impact of the property tax and pay cuts on household finances. According to the Consumer Market Monitor at UCD Michael Smurfit Graduate Business School and the Marketing Institute of Ireland, confidence reached a six-year peak in September, attributed to positive news in jobs and property markets. Earlier figures from the KBC Bank Ireland/ESRI Consumer Sentiment Index also pointed to improving consumer confidence and six-year highs in September. The market monitor shows 4,735 used cars were sold in September, an increase of 60 per cent on September last year. While lending for house purchases was steady in the third quarter, it was up by 2 per cent in September compared to the previous month. Prof Mary Lambkin , one of the authors of the report, said the increase in car and property sales in recent months was a positive sign. She said the earlier budget, and continuing improvement in employment data, should help to ensure that confidence stays upbeat in the final quarter of the year. Return to results
Councillor told he was ânot wantedâ after criticising Holles Street payments Councillor told he was ânot wantedâ after criticising Holles Street payments Councillor Pat Crimmins (FG), a member of the Holles Street board, said he was contacted by the hospital shortly after he made comments on RTÃ radio on Wednesday and was told he âwas not wantedâ anymore on the board. The board of Our Lady's Children's Hospital, Crumlin in Dublin is to discuss top-up payments to senior executives at its monthly meeting next Wednesday. The topic will also be raised at upcoming board meetings in the National Maternity Hospital , Holles Street and the Rotunda Hospital Dublin . Our Ladyâs Hospital was named as one of 13 agencies collectively paying about â¬900,000 to senior managers in top-up payments and benefits from non-State sources. The hospitalâs chief executive Lorcan Birthistle received total remuneration of more than â¬140,000 of which â¬30,000 was from a âprivately funded allowanceâ. Master of the Rotunda Hospital Dr Sam Coulter Smith received more than â¬300,000 including â¬20,000 from a privately funded allowance. The Master of Holles Street, Dr Rhona Mahony, received more than â¬280,000 including a privately funded allowance of â¬45,000. Dublin city councillor and member of the Crumlin board Michael OâSullivan (Lab) said the top-ups would be discussed at next Wednesdayâs board meeting. Pay scales Alluding to the chief executiveâs â¬110,000 basic wage, he said there were people in the HSE with far less responsibilities than running the largest childrenâs hospital in the country, who were on pay scales close to â¬100,000. While he did not wish to comment specifically on anyoneâs wage, he believed it was proper that salaries are paid with no top-ups. âBut a hospital board that is faced with a situation that their funder is not giving them in their view enough money to fund a position are faced with a choice of what to do,â he said. Councillor Pat Crimmins (FG), a member of the Holles Street board, said he was contacted by the hospital shortly after he made comments on RTÃ radio on Wednesday and was told he âwas not wantedâ anymore on the board. âHolles Street has asked me to resign and I have referred them to Dublin City Council who are responsible for my appointment,â he said. When he spoke on the radio he was not speaking specifically about Holles Street, he said, and was not disrespectful, but he did think the top-ups should be refunded. When he heard about Crumlin hospital he thought it was âan isolated caseâ. âI was ever so much more shocked when the other hospitals were mentioned,â he said. Councillor PÃ¡draig McLoughlin (Lab), on the board of the Rotunda, said he would be asking for more information on the top-ups at its next meeting. He said top-ups had not come up at board level since he took up his appointment just over a year ago. The cap on salary was a good idea, he said, and the HSE had questions to answer about why it was not enforcing its own guidelines. He pointed out that advisors to the Government had breached the pay cap. âYou canât expect a hospital administrator to stick to the pay cap if an adviser doesnât stick to the pay cap.â Comments are closed for this article.
Cyber criminals step up the pace Cyber criminals step up the pace So-called phishing attacks that try to trick people into handing over confidential details have boomed in 2004, say security experts. The number of phishing e-mail messages stopped by security firm MessageLabs has risen more than tenfold in less than 12 months. In 2004 it detected more than 18 million phishing e-mail messages. Other statistics show that in 2004 73% of all e-mail was spam and one in 16 messages were infected with a virus. In its end-of-year report, MessageLabs said that phishing had become the top security threat and most popular form of attack among cyber criminals. In September 2003, MessageLabs caught only 273 phishing e-mails that tried to make people visit fake versions of the websites run by real banks and financial organisations. But by September 2004 it was stopping more than two million phishing related e-mail messages per month. Worryingly, said the firm, phishing gangs were using increasingly sophisticated techniques to harvest useful information such as login details or personal data. Older attacks relied on users not spotting the fact that the site they were visiting was fake, but more recent phishing e-mails simply try to steal details as soon as a message is opened. Other phishing scams try to recruit innocent people into acting as middlemen for laundering money or goods bought with stolen credit cards. "E-mail security attacks remain unabated in their persistence and ferocity," said Mark Sunner, chief technology officer at MessageLabs. "In just 12 months phishing has firmly established itself as a threat to any organisation or individual conducting business online," he said. Mr Sunner said MessageLabs was starting to see some phishing attacks become very focused on one company or organisation. "Already particular businesses are threatened and blackmailed, indicating a shift from the random, scattergun approach, to customised attacks designed to take advantage of the perceived weaknesses of some businesses," he said. Although phishing attacks grew substantially throughout 2004, viruses and spam remain popular with cyber-criminals and vandals. One of the biggest outbreaks took place in January when the MyDoom virus started circulating. To date the company has caught more than 60 million copies of the virus. Also up this year was the amount of spam in circulation. In 2003 only 40% of messages were spam. But by the end of 2004, almost three-quarters of messages were junk.

DVD copy protection strengthened DVD copy protection strengthened DVDs will be harder to copy thanks to new anti-piracy measures devised by copy protection firm Macrovision. The pirated DVD market is enormous because current copy protection was hacked more than five years ago. Macrovision says its new RipGuard technology will thwart most, but not all, of the current DVD ripping (copying) programs used to pirate DVDs. "RipGuard is designed to... reduce DVD ripping and the resulting supply of illegal peer to peer," said the firm. Macrovision said the new technology will work in "nearly all" current DVD players when applied to the discs, but it did not specify how many machines could have a problem with RipGuard. The new technology will be welcomed by Hollywood film studios which are increasingly relying on revenue from DVD sales. The film industry has stepped up efforts to fight DVD piracy in the last 12 months, taking legal action against websites which offer pirated copies of DVD movies for download. "Ultimately, we see RipGuard DVD... evolving beyond anti-piracy, and towards enablement of legitimate online transactions, interoperability in tomorrow's digital home, and the upcoming high-definition formats," said Steve Weinstein, executive vice president and general manager of Macrovision's Entertainment Technologies Group. Macrovision said RipGuard was designed to plug the "digital hole" that was created by so-called DeCSS ripper software. It circumvents Content Scrambling System measures placed on DVDs and let people make perfect digital copies of copyrighted DVDs in minutes. Those copies could then be burned onto a blank DVD or uploaded for exchange to a peer-to-peer network. Macrovision said RipGuard would also prevent against "rent, rip and return" - where people would rent a DVD, copy it and then return the original. RipGuard is expected to be rolled out on DVDs from the middle of 2005, the company said. The new system works specifically to block most ripping programs - if used, those programs will now most likely crash, the company said. Macrovision has said that Rip Guard can be updated if hackers find a way around the new anti-copying measures. Return to results
Dein concerned by Chelsea stance Dein concerned by Chelsea stance Arsenal vice-chairman David Dein has voiced concern at Chelsea's stance over the Ashley Cole controversy. The Premier League is to examine "further information" from a newspaper claiming Chelsea made an alleged illegal approach for the defender. Chelsea have denied that Cole met boss Jose Mourinho to discuss a move, which would breach Premier League rule K3. "From the evidence I have seen so far there is a huge credibility gap," Dein told the News of the World. A Premier League statement read: "We received further information from the News of the World newspaper, which we will study for any facts that might be relevant to our deliberations. "Further discussions will take place between the Premier League board and both clubs next week." The Premier League had said it would only launch an investigation if there was a complaint, which has so far not been forthcoming from Arsenal. In an attempt to defuse the situation, England star Cole told Arsenal's website: "I'm under contract here for another two years so I just want to get back to playing football and trying to win the league." Mourinho has called Cole, who has been negotiating an extension to his deal at Highbury, the "best English defender" and says he wants to sign a left-back to provide competition for Wayne Bridge. But the Portuguese coach now wants Gunners boss Arsene Wenger to get in touch with him so they can discuss the situation. He said: "If Arsene wants answers, he can call me. It is true I want to buy a left-back because I only have one and I always want two for every position." Wenger wants Chelsea to make a categorical denial, but is confident Cole will stay at Arsenal. "I am 100% sure Ashley will extend his contract as he is part of the bunch of players who are the core and heart of the team," he said. "Before we complain, we must have evidence the meeting has happened but I don't know how so much assertive evidence comes out in a newspaper if it is just being invented. "It looks to me like it has happened, although I don't know for sure." Meanwhile, Everton boss David Moyes told Online News Radio Five Live that managers often approach a player's agent before talking to the club - but he insisted that talking with a player without his club's consent is a no-go area. "If you mention a player to an agent they are probably on the phone to the player within a minute," he said. "Tapping is probably used sometimes in a stronger way than that. It's part of football and will be very hard to change. It does happen a lot. "A lot of deals are done correctly but if you find out who the agent is and whether the player is interested, is that tapping? It will be nearly impossible to stop. "If the case got to where the manager met a player that would be wrong, action would have to be taken. "It should be manager to manager or chairman to chairman but the way modern football has gone I don't think that happens. There is a way the player gets got to but that is part of football. "I don't think it is right but that is the way it works." Comments are closed for this article.
Dramatically improved figures credited to appointment of dedicated surgeon at Mater hospital Dramatically improved figures credited to appointment of dedicated surgeon at Mater hospital Human respiratory system with lungs and bronchial tree The number of lung transplants carried out in Ireland increased threefold in just two years, according to new figures. The dramatically improved figures for lung transplants â which contrast with Irelandâs overall transplant figures â is being credited to the appointment of a dedicated surgeon at the countryâs lung transplant programme at Dublinâs Mater hospital. Karen Redmond , who returned to Ireland from the UK in 2011, is skilled in a new technique that increases the number of available donor organs for lung transplantation. Some 80 per cent of donor lungs have to be rejected because they contain infections or fluid, but Ms Redmond and colleagues at Harefield Hospital in Middlesex succeeded in reconditioning damaged lungs by using a technique known as ex-vivo lung perfusion. Since her appointment as a specialist thoracic lung transplant surgeon at the Mater, the number of lung transplants has increased from eight in 2011 to 24 so far this year. The number of double lung transplants has risen from two to 12. So far this year, eight heart transplants have been carried out in the Mater, roughly comparable to the 10 performed last year. This ranked Ireland a lowly 21st in Europe, though the Irish Kidney Association points out that Ireland offers patients alternatives to heart transplants that are not available in other countries. Tricia OâConnell, from Castleisland, Co Kerry, whose husband Shane is waiting for a heart transplant, appealed to the public yesterday to support efforts to increase organ donation levels. âSelfless thingâ Shane (33), who was diagnosed with dilated cardiomyopathy at the age of 11, has been on the waiting list for a transplant since February 2012. âOrgan donation is such a selfless thing for a grieving family to consider but it gives someone else their life back. Otherwise they would just be existing until their time runs out. It can save the lives of so many people who along with their families will be forever grateful. It truly is a wonderful gift, the gift of life,â said Ms OâConnell, speaking in advance of European Day for Organ Donation and Transplantation on Saturday. A rise in the number of living donors is helping to push up the number of kidney transplants. Some 134 kidney transplants have been carried out so far this year, compared to 131 last year. Twenty-four were from living donors. Comments are closed for this article.
Euro zone unemployment shows first fall in almost three years Euro zone unemployment shows first fall in almost three years Consumer price inflation - the rate of increases in the cost of shopping and paying household bills - also rose in the euro zone by 0.9 per cent in November. Photograph: Simon Dawson/Online News The first fall in euro zone unemployment in almost three years coupled with rising prices gave fresh momentum to an economic recovery, but a growing rift between the regionâs haves and have-nots continued to widen. The improvement is a welcome sign that the euro zoneâs rebound is picking up steam, more than five years after a financial crisis erupted that forced five countries, from Cyprus to Spain, to seek emergency aid from their neighbours. The jobless rate in October fell to 12.1 per cent, the first fall since February 2011, the European Unionâs statistics office Eurostat said today. That was better than economists had forecast but it belies a wide disparity across the 17 countries using the currency. âIt is a modest, pleasant surprise, but does not change the picture of a very weak labour market,â said Jonathan Loynes of Capital Economics. âThe latest news on inflation and unemployment wonât do much to relieve the pressure on the European Central Bank . to support the fragile recovery and head off a potentially damaging bout of deflation.â While just 5 per cent of Austrians are unemployed, 27 per cent of Greeks and Spaniards are without a job. In total, an unprecedented 19 million people are out of work. Consumer price inflation - the rate of increases in the cost of shopping and paying household bills - also rose in the euro zone by 0.9 per cent in November, slightly more than economists had predicted. That puts the annual inflation rate, measured on a basket of goods including cigarettes, beer and gas bills, on an upward path after an unexpected slip in October. While energy prices fell, the rising cost of food drove up the overall index. The improvement follows an encouraging recovery in optimism, despite shrinking loans to consumers and businesses in the region. Economic sentiment in the 17 countries using the euro strengthened by 0.8 points to 98.5 in the seventh straight month of gains, according to a European Commission survey yesterday, beating economistsâ expectations. The business climate reading turned positive for the first time since March last year. Wide divergences remain in the economic health of countries in the euro zone. Greece, Cyprus and Ireland suffered deflation in October, while French business confidence fell in November. The sharp differences between the countries in the euro zone, both in price rises and unemployment, present the European Central Bank with a conundrum. But its power to remedy this widening rift between prosperous countries such as Germany and struggling states including Portugal is limited. By cutting the cost of borrowing or giving banks cheap loans, it may inadvertently help those countries who need it least, fuelling price rises in Germany while credit-starved consumers in Ireland stay reluctant to spend. âItâs a major problem,â said Graham Bishop, an advisor to the European Commission. âWe have a single currency but we donât have a single economy.â âUnlike in the United States, there is no political will to have permanent financial transfers to weak countries in Europe,â he said. âThe differences are just something weâre going to have to live with.â(Online News) Comments are closed for this article.
FA charges Liverpool and Millwall FA charges Liverpool and Millwall Liverpool and Millwall have been charged by the Football Association over crowd trouble during their Carling Cup match on 26 October. Millwall, who lost the match 3-0, have also been charged over alleged racist behaviour by their supporters. During the match at Millwall's new Den Stadium, seats were ripped up and four people were ejected from the ground. A disabled fan was injured at the perimeter of the pitch and riot police were needed to control the situation. Liverpool fans claimed the trouble was sparked by chants about the Hillsborough disaster, where 96 supporters were crushed to death in April 1989. But Lions chairman Theo Paphitis has denied the claims. He has said CCTV footage showed the catalyst for the trouble was a Liverpool fan attacking a Millwall fan in the west stand. However, Millwall have been charged with two breaches of FA rules. They have been charged with failing to ensure that fans refrained from racist and/or abusive behaviour and for failing to prevent spectators throwing missiles onto the pitch. Liverpool have been charged with one breach for failing to prevent their fans conducting themselves in threatening and/or violent and/or provocative behaviour. Both clubs have until 23 December to respond. Return to results
FAI secures &#163;7m sponsorship deal FAI secures &#163;7m sponsorship deal The Football Association of Ireland has signed a Â£7million, six-year sponsorship deal with Umbro. The deal is the second largest in sponsorship in FAI history. It will bring in Â£4.8m in cash and be worth more than Â£2m in kit supplies with other bonus payments linked to performance in major competitions. "It brings immediate and lasting benefits to the development of the next generation of people who want to play football", said FAI chief John Delaney. "This Umbro deal provides a very stable platform over a long period which will help us provide the football community with the support they need." The Football Association of Ireland is set to announce a major new sponsorship deal later this week. A statement from the football governing body it would be a "a multi-million Euro sponsorship agreement". The news is a further boost to the FAI after the recent decision of the Irish Sports Council to restore 350,000 Euro in funding to the association. John Delaney agreed to become interim chief executive of the FAI after Fran Rooney's departure in November. Under Delaney's leadership, the FAI has agreed to Irish government demands to adhere to the recommendations of the Genesis Report. The Genesis report detailed chaotic organisation within the FAI when it was published in 2003. Return to results
Featured: âChildren dyingâ over vaccine delay âChildren dyingâ over vaccine delay Dubbed âthe silent killerâ, meningitis is feared by parents because it mostly affects young children, develops rapidly and the symptoms are easily confused with less serious infections such as flu. Images Children are dying unnecessarily because of official delays in evaluating the suitability of a new vaccine for meningitis B, drug giant Novartis has claimed. The company, which received EU approval for its Bexsero vaccine last December, has criticised the time taken by Irish authorities to evaluate its suitability for inclusion in the national immunisation programme. It says it submitted information about Bexsero to the National Immunisation Advisory Committee last year, prior to its approval by EU authorities. Senior medical development adviser Judith Abernethy said it hadnât heard anything since and couldnât talk to the Department of Health about cost issues until the committee makes a decision. âWeâre prepared to make this work and weâre open to discussions with Government over cost but we need to be able to speak to them first,â she said. A spokeswoman for the committee said the matter was âunder considerationâ and would be dealt with at a forthcoming meeting. The next meeting is scheduled for late November. Vaccines are introduced into the childhood immunisation schedule based on the recommendation of the committee and subject to approval by the department after consideration of the cost implications. Highest rates Ireland has one of the highest rates of meningitis infection in Europe, with more than three times the average rate of the disease. Dubbed âthe silent killerâ, meningitis is feared by parents because it mostly affects young children, develops rapidly and the symptoms are easily confused with less serious infections such as flu. One in 10 of those who contract meningitis dies and up to one in five survivors suffer life-long complications such as limb loss, deafness and brain damage. Meningitis B, for which no vaccine was available until Bexsero was developed, accounts for more than 80 per cent of cases of meningococcal disease in Ireland. Cost-effectiveness In the UK, the Joint Committee for Vaccinations and Immunisations recommended against its inclusion in the immunisation schedule on cost-effectiveness grounds. Concerns were also raised about the vaccineâs coverage and its impact on the carriage and transmission of men B bacteria, the Irish Medical Journal noted. However, last Friday, the committee announced it was reviewing the earlier decision after receiving new evidence about the vaccine. Novartis said it remained convinced that strong evidence supported the use of Bexsero. âWe hope public health officials come to a swift resolution, because for every month the vaccine is not available, children keep on dying unnecessarily,â said Andrin Oswald, division head, Novartis Vaccines. There were 84 cases of meningitis B infection in Ireland in 2011 and two deaths, according to the Health Protection Surveillance Centre. Return to results
Featured: âGrowing Upâ report focuses on parental stress, depression âGrowing Upâ report focuses on parental stress, depression Greater support also needed for women at risk of premature or low birth-weight delivery Report shows that âeven from a very young age, the sensitivity that parents show when interacting with their babies is important for their development.â Photograph: Jose Luis Pelaez/Blend/Getty Greater supports for parents with depression or stress and more help for women at risk of giving birth to premature or low birth-weight babies are recommended in the latest Growing Up in Ireland report published today. The report, based on the study since 2006 of 11,000 children from the age of nine months, highlights the role of parenting and family contexts in child development. âEven from a very young age, the sensitivity that parents show when interacting with their babies is important for their development,â says co-author, Dr Elizabeth Nixon from Trinity College Dublin . âBoth mothersâ and fathersâ parenting behaviours can be negatively affected by stress and depression, but babies can be protected from these potentially negative influences if sensitive parent-child interactions can be maintained.â For both parents, a significant association was noted between higher levels of depression and higher levels of stress. Maternal stress was strongly associated with difficult temperament in a child, though this was less pronounced in the case of fathers. âDifficultâ children âIt may be the case that infants with difficult temperaments demand more tolerance and patience from parents and are more stressful to deal with. It may also be that parents who are stressed may perceive their children to be more difficult to deal with,â the report states. Greater relationship satisfaction for fathers is linked to lower levels of parenting stress, it says. âAlthough stress may impact on marital relationships, the findings also highlight the potential for a positive marital relationship to buffer parents from stress.â In contrast, the income in a household was found to have no significant association with parental stress. Depression is associated with lower levels of sensitivity among fathers and, in particular, mothers. Stressed parents, and parents who work, also tend to be less sensitive, but being a single parent has no impact on mothersâ sensitivity, according to the study. âIt may be that stress depletes parentsâ physical, emotional and psychological resources, and renders it more difficult for them to engage with their infants in a sensitive and responsive manner.â Premature babies A childâs gestational age is one of the best predictors of development outcomes: being born prematurely is related to lower development scores. Having a low birth-weight or a difficult temperament is also linked to poorer outcomes. In contrast, âsensitiveâ parenting is associated with higher outcomes, although the effect is weak. âIt may be that infants who experience sensitive caregiving feel more confident in exploring their environment, which might confer benefits in terms of their cognitive, language and social development, or that [such] parents who are more sensitive also provide their infant with more stimulation and learning opportunities.â The report finds parents tend to be less sensitive when dealing with temperamentally difficult children. It speculates that such children may evoke fewer positive interactions from parents, which may in turn lead to even high levels of infant irritability. It highlights the need for health policies to help mothers take care of themselves during pregnancy and support premature and low birth-weight babies. Such cases should be targeted early and supported by home visits from public health nurses. Interventions should also focus on ameliorating parental stress and depression, it says.

Ferguson rues failure to cut gap Ferguson rues failure to cut gap Boss Sir Alex Ferguson was left ruing Manchester United's failure to close the gap on Chelsea, Everton and Arsenal after his side's 1-1 draw with Fulham. Premiership leaders Chelsea and the Gunners endured a 2-2 stalemate on Sunday, giving United the chance to make up some ground in the league. But Ferguson said: "I think what makes it so bad is that both our rivals dropped points at the weekend. "It was a great opportunity - and we haven't delivered." United went ahead through Alan Smith in the 33rd minute before Bouba Diop's superb 25-yard strike cancelled out the visitors' lead in the 87th minute. Ferguson described the result as an "absolute giveaway" after United had earlier missed a host of opportunities to finish off the encounter. He said: "It was a good performance - some of the football was fantastic - but we just didn't finish them off. "In fairness, it's a fantastic strike from the Fulham player." The result leaves Ferguson's side fourth in the league on 31 points - four points behind Arsenal and a further five back from Chelsea. Comments are closed for this article.
Fifa agrees goal-line technology Fifa agrees goal-line technology Fifa is expected to use a football containing a microchip as part of new goal-line technology in September's Under-17 World championships in Peru. The game's governing body has agreed to the experiment in a bid to end controversies over goal-line decisions. It follows a presentation by sports manufacturer Adidas to the International FA board in Cardiff. The company tested the device in a game between Nuremberg and their reserve team ahead of the board's meeting. A football has a microchip inside, so when it crosses the goal-line the referee is alerted directly by a bleeper-type system rather than any video replays being used. The fact that there is no delay to the game has impressed the Ifab, which is made up of four Fifa representatives plus a member of each of the four home associations. The English Football Association had offered to experiment with the ball as well but both the Premier League and Football League use balls made by rival manufacturers. Adidas is developing the new ball with the German-based Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft research centre, but believes that such rigorous experimentation is needed that it is unlikely to be ready for next year's World Cup final in Germany. Calls for new technology resurfaced after Spurs were denied a clear goal at Manchester United when goalkeeper Roy Carroll dropped the ball behind the line, but the incident was missed by the officials.

Figures from the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI) concerning the birth rate and the qua... Figures from the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI) concerning the birth rate and the quality of healthcare provided to mothers make for positive reading. The threat posed by an economically unbalanced, aging population, has been kept at bay while infant mortality rates continue to fall. The study will provide important long-term information for planners, not just in areas of healthcare, but also in education and housing. It has particular relevance for local authorities. In spite of recession and a resumption of emigration, Irelandâs population continues to grow. The ESRI charted a small decline in the number of live births during the past three years. In spite of that, the Irish birth rate remains the highest within the European Union , some 50 per cent higher than the European average. Inward migration contributed significantly to this development as young families and young women moved here to find work. One in four births now involve mothers who were born outside of Ireland . There is evidence that some women may be postponing having children because of the recession. The average age of mothers giving birth increased by more than a year, to 31.9 years, within the past decade. At the same time, hospital care improved; hospital stays shortened and the mortality rate for small babies fell by almost one-third. These are important developments that indicate an improving health service. Less positive has been the failure to convince Irish-born mothers of the advantages of breastfeeding. Mothers from America and Europe are nearly twice as likely to feed their children in this way. Ireland has become an urban society, with 60 per cent of people living in villages, towns and cities. The children being born today will accelerate that trend and have implications for transport, energy, housing, job creation and a variety of social services. Long term planning hardly existed in the past. This time, we must get it right and ensure greater social equality for the next generation. Comments are closed for this article.
Five things you wonât see in this yearâs budget Five things you wonât see in this yearâs budget As Budget 2014 approaches, hereâs a few things youâre unlikely to hear this afternoon A cut in the number of DÃ¡il deputies: Ireland currently has 166 TDs representing 43 constituencies throughout the State. Although the Government said it would reduce the number of TDs back in 2011, it proposed cutting deputies by only eight overall. That cut is expected to come in from the next DÃ¡il but, according to the constitution, there needs to be at least one representative per 30,000 population, preventing any drastic cuts. Of course, the Government could put it to a referendum, like they did with the Seanad. But for the time being, weâre stuck with at least 158 deputes in the DÃ¡il. A pay cut for TDs and ministers: The Taoiseach currently earns â¬200,000 after taking a pay cut upon entering office in 2011. The average TD, meanwhile, earns around â¬92,000, while Cabinet members and Ministers of State get additional payments on top of that. Thatâs less than in the US, where the president earns $400,000, while the average congressman earns $172,000. But itâs significantly more than most European countries, including Britain. Youâd think TDs could stand to take a pay cut, but itâs unlikely that Enda and Co will be forced to downgrade their salaries this year, despite the drive to cut costs that was given as a chief reason behind abolishing the Seanad. Reduce the tax burden: First there was the income levy, which was only ever expected to be a temporary measure. Then came the universal social charge in January 2011, which by 2013 took between 2 per cent and 7 per cent of the applicable income. Now we have property taxes, soon to be joined by water charges and increased DIRT rates are looming. What we wonât see if an easing of the tax burden on ordinary citizens. A third tax band for high earners Although a higher rate of tax has been lobbied long and hard for, itâs unlikely that weâll see it imposed any time soon. Previous efforts to get a third rate of tax for high earners â those on more than â¬100,000 a year, for example â have come to nothing. It would be a little like turkeys voting for Christmas. An increase corporation tax: Ireland is home to many multinationals and, although our low corporation tax helps attract some of them to these shores, apparently itâs not the reason they stay here. Instead, weâre often told, tax is a secondary reason to locate in Ireland, with the primary one being the quality of talented people. That may be true for the existing companies, but would we be quite so quick to attract new companies to these shores if we increased our corporation tax a little? Either way, itâs unlikely that ministers will want to rock the proverbial boat by adding to the tax burden of US multinationals operating in Ireland. And given the Governmentâs staunch defence of the corporate tax rate despite heavy pressure from other EU leaders, the chance of raising the rate by even a couple of percentage points seem extremely unlikely. .

Gadget growth fuels eco concerns Gadget growth fuels eco concerns Technology firms and gadget lovers are being urged to think more about the environment when buying and disposing of the latest hi-tech products. At the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas earlier this month, several hi-tech firms were recognised for their strategies to help the environment. Ebay also announced the Rethink project bringing together Intel, Apple, and IBM among others to promote recycling. The US consumer electronics market is set to grow by over 11% in 2005. But more awareness is needed about how and where old gadgets can be recycled as well as how to be more energy efficient, said the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Of particular growing concern is how much energy it takes to recharge portable devices, one of the fastest growing markets in technology. The Consumer Electronics Association (CEA) has predicted that shipments of consumer technologies in 2005 will reach more than $125.73 billion (nearly Â£68 billion). Ebay's initiative pulls together major technology firms, environment groups, government agencies and eBay users to give information about what to do with old computers and where to send them. The online auction house thinks that its already-established community of loyal users could be influential. "We really became aware of the e-waste issue and we saw that our 125 million users can be a powerful force for good," eBay's David Stern told the Online News News website. "We saw the opportunity to meet the additional demand we have on the site for used computers and saw the opportunity too to good some good for the environment." But it is not just computers that cause a problem for the environment. Teenagers get a new mobile every 11 months, adults every 18 months and a 15 million handsets are replaced in total each year. Yet, only 15% are actually recycled. This year, a predicted two billion people worldwide will own a mobile, according to a Deloitte report. Schemes in the US, like RIPMobile, could help in targeting younger generations with recycling messages. The initiative, which was also launched at CES, rewards 10 to 28-year-olds for returning unused phones. "This system allows for the transformation of a drawer full of unused mobile phones into anything from music to clothes to electronics or games," said Seth Heine from RIPMobile. One group of students collected 1,000 mobiles for recycling in just three months. Mr Heine told the Online News News website that what was important was to raise awareness amongst the young so that recycling becomes "learned behaviour". Europe is undoubtedly more advanced than the US in terms of recycling awareness and robust "end of life" programmes, although there is a tide change happening in the rest of the world too. Intel showcased some its motherboards and chips at CES which are entirely lead free. "There is more and more awareness on the consumer side, but the whole industry is moving towards being lead free," Intel's Allen Wilson told the Online News News website. "There is still low-level awareness right now, but it is on the rise - the highest level of awareness is in Europe." A European Union (EU) directive, WEEE (Waste Electronic and Electrical Equipment), comes into effect in August. It puts the responsibility on electrical manufacturers to recycle items that are returned to them. But developments are also being made to design better technologies which are more energy efficient and which do not contain harmful substances. Elements like chromium, lead, and cadmium - common in consumer electronics goods - will be prohibited in all products in the EU by 2006. But it is not just about recycling either. The predicted huge growth in the gadget market means the amount of energy used to power them up is on the rise too. The biggest culprit, according to the EPA, is the innocuous power adaptor, nicknamed "energy vampires". They provide vital juice for billions of mobile phones, PDAs (personal digital assistants), digital cameras, camcorders, and digital music players. Although there is a focus on developing efficient and improved circuits in the devices themselves, the technologies inside rechargers are still outdated and so eat up more energy than is needed to power a gadget. On 1 January, new efficiency standards for external power supplies came into effect as part of the European Commission Code of Conduct. But at CES, the EPA also unveiled new guidelines for its latest Energy Star initiative which targets external power adapters. These map out the framework for developing better adaptors that can be labelled with an Energy Star logo, meaning they are about 35% more efficient. The initiative is a global effort and more manufacturers' adaptors are being brought on board. Most are made in China. About two billion are shipped global every year, and about three billion are in use in the US alone. The EPA is already working with several companies which make more than 22% of power supplies on the market. "We are increasingly finding companies that not only want to provide neat, hi-tech devices, but also bundle with it a hi-tech, efficient power supply," the EPA's Andrew Fanara said. Initiatives like this are critical; if power adaptors continue to be made and used as they are now, consumer electronics and other small appliances will be responsible for more than 40% of electricity used in US homes, said the EPA.

Gay and bisexual men most likely to contract HIV in Ireland Gay and bisexual men most likely to contract HIV in Ireland Age of those most likely to contract the virus has fallen to 31 Rio de Janeiroâs Christ the Redeemer statue illuminated with red as part of World AIDS day in Brazil yesterday. Photograph: Marcelo SayÃ£o/EPA Mark Hilliard Half of all new cases of HIV in Ireland in the first half of this year have been among gay and bisexual men while the age of contraction of the disease continues to decline, new figures have revealed. The Gay and Lesbian Equality Network (Glen) has said the issue is of critical concern and that the statistics show gay and bisexual men are now âthe group most likely to acquire HIV in Irelandâ. To mark yesterdayâs World Aids Day, Glen pointed to data compiled for the first six months of 2013 by the HSEâs Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC). Of 165 newly diagnosed cases of HIV in that space of time, 82 were gay and bisexual men, an increase on the 72 recorded cases for 2012. âIt is clear from the figures that HIV is an issue of growing critical concern for gay and bisexual men,â said Tiernan Brady , Director of gay HIV strategies. He said that the age group of those most likely to contract the virus has also fallen, the median age now at 31. âFor a new generation of young gay and bisexual men, HIV has become a growing risk,â he said. âThere is a real and urgent need to educate young people and young gay and bisexual men in particular about sexual health and HIV. HIV is an easily preventable condition and our goal should be zero new cases.â The organisation has pointed out that due to the risk level, gay and bisexual men are more likely to test for the condition and to be treated quickly. Meanwhile, the HSEâs Gay Men Health Services (GMHS), which provides dedicated facilities in Ireland, held a community meeting on Saturday addressing a number of areas including the development of the service itself. Its most recent findings have shown that there is an increasing demand for services with 5,850 men attending clinics in 2012. Of those it says, 825 were first time attendees (an increase of 5 per cent on 2011) and 39 per cent were aged 24 or younger (an increase of 20 per cent). Some 37 per cent were born abroad while 17 per cent lived outside Dublin. The GMHS also noted that HIV testing increased by 39 per cent compared to 2011 and the number of medical consultations and STI screenings numbered 3,672. A breakdown of proportions showed that 44 per cent of Gonorrhoea and HIV cases, 35 per cent of Chlamydia and 32 per cent of syphilis were first time attendees. Return to results
Gerrard happy at Anfield Gerrard happy at Anfield Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard has reiterated his desire to stay at Anfield and win trophies with the club. The 24-year-old England midfielder is determined to see out his contract, despite reported interest from Chelsea. He said: "I'm signed here for this season and another two so there is no situation. There's a lot of speculation but that's not down to me. "As club captain all I want to do is help us get back up the table and into the Champions League again." Gerrard looked set to move to Chelsea during the summer and speculation of a switch to Stamford Bridge has again arisen, with the January transfer window approaching. He raised doubts about his Reds future when he said he wanted the club to prove they were title challengers in the very near future or he might leave. Liverpool boss Rafael Benitez has insisted that Gerrard has promised him he wants to stay at Anfield. Benitez said: "I said to Steven that I was sure he wanted to stay here and he said 'I do'. "I then said to him 'Look, if you want to win titles, you want medals and you want Liverpool to have these things then I am going to need your help'. "I really think he wants to stay so now what we must do is make the squad stronger for him." Meanwhile, Gerrard has urged the Anfield board to sign Real Madrid striker Fernando Morientes in the January transfer window. Morientes, 28, has already expressed a willingness to come to England. Gerrard added: "He's a great player. He scores goals in the league, in cup competitions and also in the Champions League. "I don't think he'd be able to play for us in Europe this season but if we are able to get hold of him, we'd be getting ourselves a great player. "He'd have Spanish coaches, a Spanish manager and we have got three or four Spanish players here now so they'll help him settle in. "Rafael Benitez knows what he wants and he knows how to strengthen the squad he's got and if the right players become available at the right price I am sure we will strengthen. "It would certainly be nice to see a few new faces in January to freshen things up." Comments are closed for this article.
Gerrard plays down European hopes Gerrard plays down European hopes Steven Gerrard has admitted that Liverpool have little chance of winning the Champions League this season. The 24-year-old Reds skipper spoke out ahead of Tuesday's first leg at home to Bayer Leverkusen in the last 16, which he will miss through suspension. "Let's be realistic, there are some fantastic teams left in the Champions League," he told Online News Radio Five Live. "We are just going to try to stay in as long as possible but we realise that maybe it is not our year this year." Gerrard has made no secret of his desire to be involved in Europe's premier club competition. Last season he described qualification for the Champions League as the "be all and end all" - and rumours persist that he will leave Anfield if the Reds fail to secure a place in the competition. He has consistently been linked with a move away from Liverpool, with Chelsea the favourites to snap up the England midfielder. And Blues boss Jose Mourinho backed Gerrard's view that Rafael Benitez's team could struggle to progress this season. "Rafa has still time in front of him to build an even better team, maybe he's a little bit behind (right now)," he told Online News Radio Five Live. Gerrard, who fired Liverpool into the last 16 of this season's competition with a brilliant goal in December's win over Olympiakos, insisted he was still fully focused on helping Liverpool to glory this season. The Reds are currently fifth in the Premiership table, five points off the crucial fourth spot, which brings Champions League qualification - and they face Chelsea in Sunday's Carling Cup final. "It's big couple of months for Liverpool," he added. "We're fighting for the fourth spot for the Champions League for next season but we are still involved in two cup competitions, which are very important. "We are confident we can upset Chelsea in the Carling Cup final and get to the last eight of the Champions League because, financially, it is big for the club and, personally for myself, it is very good."

HSE claims junior doctors seeking triple time HSE claims junior doctors seeking triple time Health boss says demand for extra payment for shifts over 24 hours âperverse incentiveâ Junior doctors have demanded in negotiations with the Health Service Executive to be paid triple time for any hours worked in excess of a 24-hour shift, according to the HSE. HSE national director of human resources Barry OâBrien said the demand, described by the Irish Medical Organisation as a âsanctionâ on hospitals, was in fact a âperverse incentiveâ. The IMO has called a one-day strike of junior doctors next Tuesday over the issue of long working hours. This follows the breakdown of negotiations between the organisation and the HSE. Mr OâBrien said today that the two sides had been working collectively under the Labour Relations Commission and making progress until the IMO raised the issue of sanctions âvery late in the dayâ. âThey are proposing additional payment for non-consultant hospital doctors (NCHDs) for work they would already have been paid for,â he told RTÃ Radio. Mr OâBrien said this wouldnât add any value and would more appropriately be dealt with under the Haddington Road agreement. He didnât have the discretion to introduce a pay rate of triple time in this instance. In talks on the issue last month, the HSE agreed to introduce a maximum 24-hour shift for junior doctors next month, except in exceptional circumstances, and to fully implement this measure by January. It also undertook to comply with the European Working Time Directive, limiting the working week to 48 hours, by the end of next year. IMO industrial relations executive Val Jones said significant differences remained between the sides. âThe main issue between the sides is the issue of sanctions. Weâve sought that if hospitals fail to meet agreed deadlines that sanctions will apply to them. The HSE is refusing to apply them in those circumstances.â Mr OâBrien said the strike, which will see junior doctors provide Sunday service on a weekday, could have significant implications for the health service. However, he said there was still an opportunity for the two sides to re-engage. Return to results
HSE considers cuts to â¬350m capital plan HSE considers cuts to â¬350m capital plan Move part of plans for reducing expenditure by â¬666 million next year and Senior Health Service Executive officials are contemplating deep cuts to the â¬350 million capital budget for the health service next year. The move is part of its plans for reducing expenditure by â¬666 million next year. The capital programme covers a wide range of investments in infrastructure and equipment across the service. The largest area of expenditure in the capital programme for next year is an upgrade to radiotherapy facilities for cancer patients in Cork and Galway which could cost about â¬100 million. While new capital projects are expected to be hardest hit in the service plan being drawn up by HSE officials, sources say existing services could be hit with widespread cuts. The HSE has until next Tuesday to draw up a service plan detailing the cuts to services due to reductions in spending announced in the budget. Controversial expenditure Planning arrangements for the service plan were fluid and cuts earmarked could ultimately be changed, according to sources. Health spending has been the focus of controversy since the budget because of a lack of clarity about the extent of cuts required for next year. HSE officials said that up to â¬1 billion in cuts may be needed in 2014 to fund expanded services and to meet existing commitments. Minister for Health James Reilly has the power to reject the service plan prepared by the HSE, which he did in 2011. Speculation is mounting that the plan may not be agreed and published until the State exits its bailout in mid-December. Meanwhile, The Online News understands that last week the HSE sought Coalition approval to reduce the level of savings expected from the Haddington Road deal this year. But it is understood the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform rejected this request. The HSE had been required to generate savings of â¬150 million this year from the deal on pay and productivity. But it has acknowledged it will only realise a maximum of â¬110 million. Concern within the sector about the impact of repeated cuts on the quality of services is mounting. The master of the Rotunda, Dr Sam Coulter Smith , warned yesterday of âunsustainableâ levels of activity at the hospital and said the HSE and the Department of Health have been repeatedly notified of the clinical risks involved.

High rate of undiagnosed HIV detected in Mater screening High rate of undiagnosed HIV detected in Mater screening Experts warn prevalence rate of almost three in every 1,000 is high by international standards A screening programme based in Dublinâs Mater hospital has detected a high rate of undiagnosed HIV infection in the capital. Nearly three in every 1,000 people who took part in the programme tested positive for HIV - a rate which is considered high by international standards. The Mater-Bronx Rapid HIV Testing (M-BRiHT) project, a collaboration between University College Dublin , the Mater and the Jacobi Medical Centre in New York, offers people attending the hospitalâs emergency department a confidential, rapid HIV test. The test is carried by using an oral swab HIV kit and takes about 30 minutes. It shows whether the body has been making antibodies to HIV, which would signal the presence of infection. Since it began late last year, 6,000 people have taken part in the programme, with 4,900 opting to be tested and 14 returning positive results. The results indicate a prevalence of HIV of 2.85 cases in every thousand taking the test, higher than the 1 in 1000 prevalence rate for which experts recommend widespread screening . Project leader Dr Ger OâConnor said: âThe results show a high HIV prevalence and also that the emergency department is an ideal setting for HIV screening if implemented in the right way.â âWe want people to know their HIV status â diagnosing HIV early helps the person with HIV to get the full benefits from treatment and also can prevent unintended onward transmission.â Patients who opt to participate in the programme watch a novel interactive counselling video, complete an on-screen survey that assesses risk behaviour. The latest national figures show there have been 315 new cases of HIV diagnosed so far this year, including six new cases last week. There has been an upsurge in the roll-out of HIV screening programmes in parallel with advances in treatment and management of the virus. Those diagnosed early who receive appropriate treatment can, according to experts, stay healthy and expect a normal lifespan. âThis has been a real ground breaking advance in HIV research and one that the whole population can help with,â said Dr Paddy Mallon, consultant in Infectious Diseases at the Mater and the principal investigator on the M-BRiHT Study. âIf we can identify those with undiagnosed HIV and help prevent them from passing on the infection, we can stop this epidemic in its tracks,â he added. The M-BRiHT project is part of a three-year research project co-ordinated through University College Dublin. The preliminary results of the programme were released today as part of the 2013 European HIV testing week. Comments are closed for this article.
Hitachi unveils 'fastest robot' Hitachi unveils 'fastest robot' Japanese electronics firm Hitachi has unveiled its first humanoid robot, called Emiew, to challenge Honda's Asimo and Sony's Qrio robots. Hitachi said the 1.3m (4.2ft) Emiew was the world's quickest-moving robot yet. Two wheel-based Emiews, Pal and Chum, introduced themselves to reporters at a press conference in Japan. The robots will be guests at the World Expo later this month. Sony and Honda have both built sophisticated robots to show off developments in electronics. Explaining why Hitachi's Emiew used wheels instead of feet, Toshihiko Horiuchi, from Hitachi's Mechanical Engineering Research Laboratory, said: "We aimed to create a robot that could live and co-exist with people." "We want to make the robots useful for people ... If the robots moved slower than people, users would be frustrated." Emiew - Excellent Mobility and Interactive Existence as Workmate - can move at 3.7m/h. Its "wheel feet" resemble the bottom half of a Segway scooter. With sensors on the head, waist, and near the wheels, Pal and Chum demonstrated how they could react to commands. "I want to be able to walk about in places like Shinjuku and Shibuya [shopping districts] in the future without bumping into people and cars," Pal told reporters. Hitachi said Pal and Chum, which have a vocabulary of about 100 words, could be "trained" for practical office and factory use in as little as five to six years. Robotics researchers have long been challenged by developing robots that walk in the gait of a human. At the recent AAAS (American Association for the Advancement of Science) annual meeting in Washington DC, researchers showed off bipedal designs. The three designs, each built by a different research group, use the same principle to achieve a human-like gait. Sony and Honda have both used humanoid robots, which are not commercially available, as a way of showing off computing power and engineering expertise. Honda's Asimo was "born" five years ago. Since then, Honda and Sony's Qrio have tried to trump each other with what the robots can do at various technology events. Asimo, has visited the UK, Germany, the Czech Republic, France and Ireland as part of a world tour. Sony's Qrio has been singing, jogging and dancing in formation around the world too and was, until last year, the fastest robot on two legs. But its record was beaten by Asimo. It is capable of 3km/h, which its makers claim is almost four times as fast as Qrio. Last year, car maker Toyota also stepped into the ring and unveiled its trumpet-playing humanoid robot. By 2007, it is predicted that there will be almost 2.5 million "entertainment and leisure" robots in homes, compared to about 137,000 currently, according to the United Nations (UN). By the end of that year, 4.1 million robots will be doing jobs in homes, said the report by the UN Economic Commission for Europe and the International Federation of Robotics. Hitachi is one of the companies with home cleaning robot machines on the market. Comments are closed for this article.
Hospital board acknowledges allowance funded from âon-site commercial activitiesâ Hospital board acknowledges allowance funded from âon-site commercial activitiesâ Colin Gleeson The board of Our Ladyâs Childrenâs Hospital, Crumlin last night stated its intention to âpursue directlyâ the matter of a pay rise for the hospitalâs chief executive with the HSE. The hospitalâs chief executive is Lorcan Birthistle who, according to files at the Department of Health, receives total remuneration of â¬140,808. This includes a top-up of â¬30,000 from a âprivately funded allowanceâ. Mr Birthistleâs salary is among the lowest paid to the countryâs hospital chief executives, and last week councillor Ruairi McGinley â who is a board member â said he was certain ââ¬110,000 is not an appropriate salary for a chief executive of a national childrenâs hospitalâ. He said no one in the public service should earn more than the Taoiseachâs salary of â¬185,000 and added that the salary of the chief executive at Crumlin hospital was âat the lowest end of any of the numbers that have appearedâ. âAppropriate renumerationâ A statement released following a meeting of the hospital board last night said it has previously attempted to secure the approval of the health authorities for âan appropriate remuneration levelâ for the chief executive. âThe board believes this can now be achieved in accordance with the recommendations of the HSE Internal Audit Report and this will be pursued directly with the HSE,â the statement said.

Irish bond yields fall to 4-month low Irish bond yields fall to 4-month low Ten-year bond yields decline as Michael Noonan prepares trips to discuss exit from bailout programme. Irelandâs 10-year yield fell four basis points, or 0.04 percentage points, to 3.68 per cent at lunch-time today, after dropping to 3.67 per cent, the least since May 31st. The 3.9 per cent bond due in March 2023 rose 0.28, or â¬2.80 per â¬1,000 face amount, to â¬101.725. Talks on Irelandâs exit from its bailout programme are set to gain pace this month, with Minister for Finance Michael Noonan set to travel to both Strasbourg and Washington to discuss the countryâs options. Taoiseach Enda Kenny said at the weekend that Ireland would exit its three-year bailout on December 15th. Mr Noonan will travel to Strasbourg on October 23rd and October 24th to meet European Commission and European Central Bank staff, before flying to Washington for meetings with the International Monetary Fund (IMF)on October 28th. According to the Department of Finance , the talks will focus âon what options may be available to Ireland as it exits the bailout, including potential backstopsâ. In Luxembourg today, Eurozone finance mainisters may discuss backstops and Irelandâs potential exit from the bailout programme, while Irelandâs bailout troika will begin their 12th review of the countryâs bailout program on October 29th. Meanwhile, a report from the IMF today said that tomorrowâs budget is âon trackâ, although it noted that buffers with respect to the 7.5 per cent of GDP deficit ceiling have narrowed. Consolidation efforts will continue in 2014 it said in its latest âFiscal Monitorâ report. From a wider European perspective, the IMF said in the report that Europe has already achieved about two-thirds of the adjustment needed to broadly balance the budget, asserting that reaching these medium-term objectives is well within the bounds of what has been done in history.However, it warned that adjustment fatigue looms large as economic growth remains anaemic.

Kenny reiterates commitment to youth jobs guarantee scheme Kenny reiterates commitment to youth jobs guarantee scheme Ireland can avail of a â¬200 million fund over the next two years to create the guarantee scheme European Commission president Jose Manuel Barroso (left) speaks with German chancellor Angela Merkel (centre) and European Parliament president Martin Schultz (right) prior to an international summit on youth unemployment in the European Union at the Elysee Palace in Paris today. Photograph: Online News Ireland can avail of a â¬200 million fund to create a youth jobs guarantee over the next two years, Taoiseach Enda Kenny said following an EU summit on youth employment. Under the guarantee, no unemployed young person will be allowed to go longer than four months without a job offer or training. Asked whether the four-month deadline might have to be extended because of insufficient funds and inadequate training capacity, Mr Kenny said âThe plan will be ready (next month) and we will live up to the four-month commitment. We are absolutely focused on this.â The Taoiseach said that approximately â¬200 million would available over the next two years, of which about one third would be contributed by Ireland. JosÃ© Manuel Barroso, the president of the EU Commission, had promised their would be no delay in making the money available. Mr Kenny said Minister for Social Protection Joan Burton, who attended the summit with him, would present the plan. It will be discussed in the DÃ¡il before the end of December âand weâll proceed to implement it.â Regarding Irelandâs pending decision on whether to apply for a post-bailout line of credit, Mr Kenny said he briefed âat least eight of tenâ of the 24 leaders at the summit, including German Chancellor Angela Merkel . He told them the government was still consulting people and would make its decision before December 15th. âThe leaders were happy to be updated on that.â In his speech in the ÃlysÃ©e Palace, Mr Kenny stressed the importance of the digital economy. âIâd like to emphasise the enormous potential of the digital economy,â he said, quoting an EU Commission report saying it grows âat seven times the rate of the rest of the economy.â The last EU Council talked about âcreating a digital single marketâ and acknowledged that information and communication technology could create 900,000 jobs by 2015, Mr Kenny continued. âUpskilling our young jobseekers to fill in demand digital roles is a win-win for the EU economy. It will kick-start young careers. It will spawn new fast-growing tech companies.â Joan Burton placed the emphasis elsewhere, on learning from the experience of Austria - âsmall like usâ - and Germany, which have the lowest youth unemployment in the EU. She praised their âdual systemâ where training and education are combined with on-the-job work experience. Asked if the recent cut in the jobseekerâs allowance, from â¬188 to â¬ 100 a week, indicated a shortfall in funds for Irelandâs 65,000 unemployed young people, Ms Burton said training, education and in-work experience were âa much better investmentâ¦ rather than have young people shifting onto the dole and being left there without much hope for themselves or their family.â Return to results
Kenyan school turns to handhelds Kenyan school turns to handhelds At the Mbita Point primary school in western Kenya students click away at a handheld computer with a stylus. They are doing exercises in their school textbooks which have been digitised. It is a pilot project run by EduVision, which is looking at ways to use low cost computer systems to get up-to-date information to students who are currently stuck with ancient textbooks. Matthew Herren from EduVision told the Online News programme Go Digital how the non-governmental organisation uses a combination of satellite radio and handheld computers called E-slates. "The E-slates connect via a wireless connection to a base station in the school. This in turn is connected to a satellite radio receiver. The data is transmitted alongside audio signals." The base station processes the information from the satellite transmission and turns it into a form that can be read by the handheld E-slates. "It downloads from the satellite and every day processes the stream, sorts through content for the material destined for the users connected to it. It also stores this on its hard disc." The system is cheaper than installing and maintaining an internet connection and conventional computer network. But Mr Herren says there are both pros and cons to the project. "It's very simple to set up, just a satellite antenna on the roof of the school, but it's also a one-way connection, so getting feedback or specific requests from end users is difficult." The project is still at the pilot stage and EduVision staff are on the ground to attend to teething problems with the Linux-based system. "The content is divided into visual information, textual information and questions. Users can scroll through these sections independently of each other." EduVision is planning to include audio and video files as the system develops and add more content. Mr Herren says this would vastly increase the opportunities available to the students. He is currently in negotiations to take advantage of a project being organised by search site Google to digitise some of the world's largest university libraries. "All books in the public domain, something like 15 million, could be put on the base stations as we manufacture them. Then every rural school in Africa would have access to the same libraries as the students in Oxford and Harvard" Currently the project is operating in an area where there is mains electricity. But Mr Herren says EduVision already has plans to extend it to more remote regions. "We plan to put a solar panel at the school with the base station, have the E-slates charge during the day when the children are in school, then they can take them home at night and continue working." Maciej Sundra, who designed the user interface for the E-slates, says the project's ultimate goal is levelling access to knowledge around the world. "Why in this age when most people do most research using the internet are students still using textbooks? The fact that we are doing this in a rural developing country is very exciting - as they need it most." Return to results
Learning to love broadband Learning to love broadband We are reaching the point where broadband is a central part of daily life, at least for some, argues technology analyst Bill Thompson. One of the nice things about being a writer is that I rarely have to go to an office to work. I can sit in a caf&#233; or a library, with or without a wi-fi connection, and research and write articles. If I am passing through Kings Cross station on my way to a meeting then I can log on from the platform. And I can spend the day working with my girlfriend Anne, a children's writer, at her house in Cambridge, sharing her wireless network. But just over a week ago I arrived at her house to find that there was no network connection. We checked the cable modem and noticed that it had no power, and when she changed the power lead it sparked at her in a way which made it abundantly clear that it was never going to talk to the internet again. She called her service provider, and they told her it would be five days before an engineer would show up with a new cable modem. This did not seem too bad, but in fact she really suffered until her connection was restored on Wednesday. With no modem installed in her computer, she had to borrow internet access from friends or use the dial-up connection on her daughter's laptop, so she had to choose between copying her files onto her USB memory card or accepting a slower and flakier net connection. As a result she did not submit the pictures she wanted to use for a book on earthquakes because they were too big to send over dial-up. She could not research other material because she is used to having easy access to a fast link that lets her search quickly and effectively. But the impact spread into her personal life too. She did not take her children to the cinema during half-term because she could not find out which films were showing at the local cinemas. She planned a trip to Norfolk but did not check the weather because the only place she knows to look for weather information is the Online News website. And she did not know where to go fossil-hunting on the trip because she could not type "fossils Norfolk" into Google. Of course, she readily admits, she could have answered these questions if she had looked in the local paper, listened to the radio or found a book on fossils. But she did not, because having fast, always on, and easy access to the net has become part of the routine of her daily life, and when it was taken away it was too much effort to go back to the old ways of doing things. She may be unusual, but I do not think Anne is alone. According to Ofcom there were almost four million broadband users in the UK in April 2004, and numbers are climbing fast. There will certainly be five million by the end of the year. Dial-up users are switching to broadband. My dad finally made the change earlier this month and new net users are selecting broadband from the start. More and more of these broadband users are beginning to mould their daily lives around the availability of broadband internet connections, and they too will find it difficult to cope if they cannot get online for any reason. It is part of the process of adaptation, and it is a vital step in the growth of broadband in the UK and elsewhere. People who have integrated net access into their daily lives tell their friends about it, and show off the cool stuff they can do. They encourage other people to get broadband so that they can share digital photos and do all of the other things that need fast and reliable connectivity. Of course, broadband in the UK is laughably slow compared to other parts of the world. In South Korea, Japan and Hong Kong normal connection speeds are measured in megabits, or millions of bits, a second rather than the thousands that we are supposed to be happy with. But speed is only a small part of the attraction of broadband, and when it comes to checking websites for film times, looking at weather forecasts, or all of the other small things that make a real difference to the routines and habits of our daily lives, even UK speeds are sufficient. It may not be the brave new world of streaming full-screen video and superfast file downloads, but it will do for now. And it is certainly better than slow access or no access. Just ask Anne.

Local authority sick leave twice that in the private sector Local authority sick leave twice that in the private sector Absenteeism in city and county councils cost State â¬64 million A total of 353,176 working days were lost, an average of 11.78 sick days per local authority employee. Of these, 310,466 were paid sick days and just 42,710 were unpaid. Doctorsâ sick certs were presented in relation to 301,108 of the absences while 52,068 sick days were uncertified . Absenteeism rates among local authority staff are twice that of workers in the private sector, and are higher than in the HSE or the civil service, newly published Government figures show. Local authority workers take an average of almost 12 sick days each a year at a cost of more than â¬64 million to the State, according to the latest report from the Local Government Audit Service. Absenteeism rates attributed to illness in city and county councils have been on the rise for almost a decade, according to the value-for-money audit. Workers in Limerick city are the unhealthiest, taking an average of 17 sick days a year, while their neighbours working for the county council take fewer than 12 days a years. The trend is reversed in Waterford where county council workers take more than 15 days off a year and their counterparts in the city fewer than 12. Donegal council workers have the best health, taking just nine days off each. Among the four Dublin local authorities, sick leave rates are highest in Fingal, where workers take an average of 13 days off a year and lowest in the city, where the average is fewer than 11 days off a year. Halve entitlements The audit relates to 2011 figures but has just been published ahead of Government measures to halve sick leave entitlements for the public sector. The changes due to come into force next month allow workers three monthsâ full pay followed by three monthsâ half pay followed by âtemporary rehabilitation payâ for a maximum period of two years for certified sick leave. Uncertified sick leave will be cut from seven days in any 12-month period to seven days in any two-year period. The absenteeism rate for illness across the Stateâs 34 local authorities was 5.19 per cent in 2011, in the HSE it was 4.9 per cent and in the civil service 4.21 per cent. However, in the private sector, the rate was 2.58 per cent, or fewer than six days missed per worker, according to employersâ body Ibec. Sick leave absences among local authority workers cost â¬64.64 million in 2011. A target has been set to reduce illness-related absences to 3.5 per cent, which the report said would result in annual savings of â¬21 million. Working days lost A total of 353,176 working days were lost, an average of 11.78 sick days per local authority employee. Of these, 310,466 were paid sick days and just 42,710 were unpaid. Doctorsâ sick certs were presented in relation to 301,108 of the absences while 52,068 sick days were uncertified . Just under 30,000 staff took sick days . The number of staff who took no sick days could not be calculated, the report said, because two local authorities did not provide details, and one did not provide sufficient information. Some 11,314 employees availed of 236,422 certified days, while 12,827 employees took 37,394 uncertified days. The report found one-third of local authorities had set no target for reducing absenteeism and half had no attendance management plan. The top causes of short-term illness absence were flu, colds, and respiratory tract infections. The causes of long-term sickness were cited as musculoskeletal disorders, post-surgery and acute medical conditions such as cancers. .

Local chef Paul Smith will be introducing children to the joys of cooking and eating healthier food ... Local chef Paul Smith will be introducing children to the joys of cooking and eating healthier food this Friday, October 25th, at Holy Rosary National School, in Wicklow town. More than 300 children and a number of parents will be at the demonstration which runs from 9.30am to 2pm. The event is part of the healthy town initiative and Mr Smith said the emphasis was on showing that food can be fun. He said children would be given a tray containing carrot, broccoli, celery and a tomato and asked to try at least one. (The vegetables will, of course, be cut in interesting shapes). They will also be shown how to make a sausage roll and a gluten-free Parmesan biscuit. But are sausage rolls healthy? According to Mr Smith, making them yourself means they are fresh and have no MSG or preservatives unlike those bought in shops. He will be emphasising to children not to go into the kitchen unless an adult is present and advising parents not to use food as a punishment or reward. And he has this tip for both parents and children: Always look at the label when shopping for food. The ingredient that is most prevalent will be listed first. Mr Smith, who cooked for former president Bill Clinton in 1994 when he worked in the US, said children and parents would be given handouts containing tips on healthy foods.

Many share responsibility for cheerleading unsustainable policies Many share responsibility for cheerleading unsustainable policies âBy early 2007 at the latest, the property market was already collapsing and all that remained was for the true scale of the banking and budgetary debacles and the implications for the taxpayer to eventually come to light.â Donal Donovan, Antoin Murphy Traditionally the Irish, who can sing the dead to sleep, have been good at organising wakes. The financial wake of 2008 is another matter. 2008 will be known as the year that initiated the great financial crisis, just as 1847 has gone down as âBlack 47â, the year when the Great Famine peaked. âBlack 47â involved a massive loss of population and a debilitating legacy of emigration. âBlack 2008â, while not as catastrophic in human terms, caused extensive damage to a sizeable part of Irelandâs economic fabric and had major repercussions for all parts of Irish society. Our recent book (The Fall of the Celtic Tiger: Ireland and the Euro Debt Crisis, Oxford University Press) seeks to provide a balanced assessment of the main domestic and international forces that help to explain Irelandâs economic crisis that was triggered in September 2008. Based on a detailed and analytical examination of all the available evidence, the book shows how Ireland experienced four crises â a property crisis, a banking crisis, a fiscal crisis and a financial crisis. It addresses several key questions. International dimension The first of these concerns exactly who or what was âto blameâ for what happened? We conclude that while the international dimensions (the prevailing philosophy of light regulation, the inadequacy of the EU stability and growth pact and the inherent architectural flaws of the euro zone) were important, major responsibility lay at the domestic level. However, âblameâ is a multidimensional concept. There were those who benefited greatly from and acquiesced in the artificial riches of the boom (most of Irish society and not only bankers, developers, and the accountancy and auditing professions), those who were âcheerleaders â for the good times (principally politicians of all parties , especially during the 2002 and 2007 elections, as well as most of the media) and the âexpertsâ (the Financial Regulator, the Central Bank, the Department of Finance , and the economic profession generally). All share responsibility, in different ways, for the fact that, collectively, âwe lost the run of ourselvesâ. The second question is whether, once the crisis began to emerge, there was anything that could or should have been done differently to reduce the massive costs to the taxpayer or to avert the arrival of the EU-IMF troika in late 2010? Budgetary debacles By early 2007 at the latest, nearly all the property-related loans had been extended, the property market was already collapsing and all that remained was for the true scale of the banking and budgetary debacles and the implications for the taxpayer to eventually come to light. After considering all the alternatives, the authors conclude that, given the paramount need to avert a run on the banks (entailing with it potentially catastrophic consequences), by late September 2008, some form of comprehensive bank guarantee could not have been avoided. Moreover, given the enormous underlying budgetary deficit â a major problem quite separate from the banking losses â subsequent intervention by the EU-IMF troika became inevitable despite the governmentâs vain efforts to stave this off. Historians will doubtless debate the above issues for many years. But there is a third question that is critical going forward, bearing in mind that this is the second time in 25 years that Ireland has faced major financial difficulties that were largely of its own making. What lessons can be drawn about the Irish policy-making process to help prevent yet another crisis some time in the future? First, there is a clear need to pay more attention to learning both from history and experiences elsewhere. The 1980s crisis was a classic result of a small, open economy relying on a major fiscal expansionary policy financed by foreign borrowing. Although Irelandâs recent property bubble was similar to that seen across many other countries throughout history, many erroneously ended up believing that this time we were somehow âdifferentâ. The study of history, including economic history and the history of economic thought, is still of paramount importance to avoid the excesses of those who believe the present is unique and the past of little relevance. .

Measures set out to tackle cigarette company marketing targeting young people Measures set out to tackle cigarette company marketing targeting young people Minister for Health Dr James Reilly and Dr Haik Nikogosian (right), head of the Framework Convention of Tobacco Control at the World Health Organisation, at the launch today of the Tobacco Free Ireland policy document at Croke Park in Dublin. Photograph: Colin Keegan/Collins A plan to reduce the prevalence of smoking in Ireland to less than 5 per cent of the population by 2025 has been published by Minister for Health James Reilly . Tobacco Free Ireland recommends introducing legislation to prohibit smoking within the campuses of primary schools, secondary schools and child care facilities, as well as the promotion of tobacco free campuses for all third level institutions. The report sets out 60 recommendations aimed at cutting the rate of smoking. Currently 22 per cent of the adult population smokes. Dr Reilly said the measures would seek to protect the next generation from taking up âthis dreadful habit that kills one in two of those who use itâ. The document broadly sets out the Governmentâs aims but a detailed action plan with timelines has yet to be developed. The proposals, which have been criticised by smokersâ rights campaigners, would also see an annual excise duty increase on tobacco products applied over a continuous five year period. âRobust evidence exists demonstrating that higher tobacco taxes and prices are the single most effective measure to reduce overall tobacco use,â the report states. Also speaking at the event, World Health Organisation tobacco control chief Dr Haik Nikogosian said the plan was a âbold exampleâ of Irelandâs âstrong leadershipâ on tobacco measures over the past number of years. In particular Dr Nikogosian praised the aim of âdenormalisingâ smoking, that is to make it socially unacceptable. However Campaigners have criticised the proposal as âmorally wrongâ, saying it will stigmatise hundreds of thousands of adults around the country. âDenormalising tobacco will drive more and more people to the black market and the fringes of society,â said Forest Eireann spokesman John Mallon. Ireland will not be tobacco free by 2015, Mr Mallon said, adding that Dr Reillyâs âpersonal crusade to denormalise tobacco and stigmatise adults who choose to smoke has got to stop What next? Alcohol? Sugary drinks? Convenience food?â. The Irish Cancer society meanwhile welcomed the plan, especially its aim âto deal with the constant marketing assault on children and teensâ. But the organisation also questioned whether the Department of Health had the budget to follow through on the proposals. Itâs chief executive John McCormack called on Dr Reilly to seek an increased health budget to prevent this âambitious strategyâ becoming âdilutedâ. He added that the society looked forward to seeing how the Government will deal with poorer areas where women âare over twice as likely to smoke as better-off womenâ¦ because of the social conditions that affect their livesâ. Dr Reilly said he hoped to have the heads of Bill for anti-tobacco legislation prepared later this month. He warned that plans to introduce uniform cigarette packaging and other anti-smoking measures would draw intense lobbying from big tobacco companies. âThe full weight of the tobacco industry will now be turned on us,â he said. âThey employed 161 lobbyists to lobby MEPsâ¦ thatâs the level of resource they have and theyâre prepared to throw at this. Over the past year, industry lobbyists have secured meetings with a number of Government Ministers and officials, including Taoiseach Enda Kenny. Asked about the possibility of further such meetings Dr Reilly said it was âvery unlikelyâ. The Department of Health estimates at least 5,200 people die each year from diseases caused by tobacco use. This represents almost one in five of all deaths. Return to results
Medical staff âfailed to actâ as Savitaâs condition worsened Medical staff âfailed to actâ as Savitaâs condition worsened Third and final report into pregnant womanâs death identifies failures in basic patient care The 250-page report from HIQA into the death of Savita Halappanavar in University Hospital Galway last year makes a large number of recommendations on maternity services, both national and specific to the hospital. Photograph: The Online News A new report into the death of Savita Halappanavar has found there was a failure to provide her with the most basic element of patient care and a failure to recognise and act upon signs of her clinical diagnosis in University Hospital Galway last year. The report by the Health Information and Quality Authority points to a number of âmissed opportunitiesâ which, had they been identified and acted upon, could have saved her life. Nationally, it warns that maternity services may, on occasion, not be as safe as they should be, or of sufficient quality. The report says this must be addressed as a matter of urgency and it calls on the HSE and the Department of Health to immediately undertake a review of maternity services. Summary It says the consultant obstetrician, non-consultant hospital doctors and midwives/nurses caring for Ms Halappanavar did not appear to act in a timely way in response to her clinical deterioration and identifies a failure to act or escalate concerns to âan appropriately qualified clinicianâ. Ms Halappanavar, who was 17 weeks pregnant, died in the hospital of sepsis last October 28th following a miscarriage. The Hiqa report says the recommended four-hourly observations of her temperature, heart rate and blood pressure did not appear to have been carried out at the required intervals. It also pointed to a failure to follow up on blood tests for Ms Halappanavar. âThe consultant, NCHDs and midwifery/nursing staff were responsible and accountable for ensuring that Savita Halappanavar received the right care at the right time,â according to the report. âHowever, this did not happen.â It says the most senior clinical decision maker involved in the provision of care to Ms Halappanavar at any given time should have been suitable clinically experienced and competent to interpret clinical findings and act accordingly. âUltimate clinical accountability rested with the consultant obstetrician who was leading Savita Halappanavarâs care.â In addition, the clinical governance arrangements within the hospital failed to recognise that vital hospital policies were not in use, nor were arrangements in place to ensure the provision of basic patient care on St Monicaâs Ward, where Ms Halappanavar was accommodated. The report points out that UHG had developed a local Modified Obstetric Early Warning Score (MOEWS) chart in 2009 but this was not in use on the ward three years later, in October 2012. It says there was no formal clinical escalation protocol and no emergency response team in place at the hospital and while sepsis guidelines were in place, clinical governance arrangements were ânot robust enoughâ to ensure they were adhered to. The report says it is critically important that the health service learns from mistakes, including this tragic event. However, it points out there is a âdisturbing resemblanceâ between the case of Ms Halappanavar and that of Tania McCabe and her son Zach, who died in 2007. There are 34 recommendations in the report, starting with a call for their full implementation. In addition, it says the HSE and the Department of Health must as a priority review maternity services nationally. The 250-page report from the Health Information and Quality Authority is the third report into the death of Ms Halappanavar in University Hospital Galway last year, and follows a coronerâs inquest and an inquiry by the HSE. The long-awaited report was presented to the Hiqa board on Monday evening and a copy was furnished to Minister for Health James Reilly yesterday. Ms Halappanavarâs husband Praveen, who did not cooperate with the inquiry, is also being furnished with a copy of the report through his solicitor. The terms of reference of the Hiqa report were ââto investigate the safety, quality and standards of services provided by the HSE to patients, including pregnant women, at risk of clinical deterioration, including those provided in University Hospital Galway (UHG) and as reflected in, among other things, the care and treatment provided to Savita Halappanavarâ. Dr Reilly again expressed his sincere sympathy to the Halappanavar family for theloss of Savita. âThis tragedy should not have happened. The untimely death of Savita Halappanavar on 28th October last year was a shocking wake-up call to the whole healthcare system about how failures in patientsâ care can sometimes have extreme consequences.â He said:âI am determined that out of the sad loss of this young woman our whole health system will learn lessons that will ensure that it provides safe, patient-centred care.â The Minister also said he would ensure that the report would be given careful consideration and reflection to ensure all of its findings and recommendations are responded to.

Microsoft launches its own search Microsoft launches its own search Microsoft has unveiled the finished version of its home-grown search engine. The now formally launched MSN search site takes the training wheels off the test version unveiled in November 2003. The revamped engine indexes more pages than before, can give direct answers to factual questions, and features tools to help people create detailed queries. Microsoft faces challenges establishing itself as a serious search site because of the intense competition for queries. Google still reigns supreme as the site people turn to most often when they go online to answer a query, keep up with news or search for images. But in the last year Google has faced greater competition than ever for users as old rivals, such as Yahoo and Microsoft, and new entrants such as Amazon and Blinkx, try to grab some of the searching audience for themselves. This renewed interest has come about because of the realisation that many of the things people do online begin with a search for information - be it for a particular web page, recipe, book, gadget, news story, image or anything else. Microsoft is keen to make its home-grown search engine a significant rival to Google. To generate its corpus of data, Microsoft has indexed 5 billion webpages and claims to update its document index every two days - more often than rivals. The Microsoft search engine can also answer specific queries directly rather than send people to a page that might contain the answer. For its direct answer feature, Microsoft is calling on its Encarta encyclopaedia to provide answers to questions about definitions, facts, calculations, conversions and solutions to equations. Tony Macklin, director of product at Ask Jeeves, pointed out that its search engine has been answering specific queries this way since April 2003. "The major search providers have moved beyond delivering only algorithmic search, so in many ways Microsoft is following the market," he said. Tools sitting alongside the MSN search engine allow users to refine results to specific websites, countries, regions or languages. Microsoft is also using so-called "graphic equalisers" that let people adjust the relevance of terms to get results that are more up-to-date or more popular. The company said that user feedback from earlier test versions had been used to refine the workings of the finished system. The test, or beta, version of the MSN search engine unveiled in November had a few teething troubles. On its first day many new users keen to try it were greeted with a page that said the site had been overwhelmed. Comments are closed for this article.
Microsoft plans 'safer ID' system Microsoft plans 'safer ID' system Microsoft is planning to make Windows and Internet Explorer more secure by including software to give people more control over personal information. "Info cards" will help people manage personal details on their PCs to make online services safer, said Microsoft. Microsoft's two previous programs, Passport and Hailstorm, aimed to protect users but were criticised. ID fraud is one of the UK's fastest-growing crimes, with criminals netting an estimated Â£1.3bn last year. A quarter of UK adults has either had their ID stolen, via hi-tech or other means, or knows someone who has, a recent report by Which? magazine found. Microsoft is developing a new version of Internet Explorer browser and its operating system, Windows, which has been code-named Longhorn. Michael Stephenson, director in Microsoft's Windows Server division, would not confirm however whether the new info cards ID system will be built into the current Windows XP version or Longhorn. "We're trying to make the end-user experience as simple as possible," Mr Stephenson said. The system would differ from its previous attempts to make online transactions more secure, said Microsoft. While Passport and Hailstorm stored user information centrally on the net, the latest system will store data on a user's PC. "It's going to put control of digital IDs into the hands of an end-user, the end-user will be in full control," said Mr Stephenson. Hailstorm was criticised by privacy campaigners for putting too much sensitive information into the hands of a single company. Passport provides a single log-in for more than one website and stores basic personal information. But its popularity suffered after security scares. Up to 200 million Passport accounts were left vulnerable to online theft and malicious hackers after a flaw in the system was exploited in 2003. Online auction site, eBay, stopped supporting it in January 2005. Although the flaw was fixed, Microsoft has come under regular criticism for the number of security loopholes in Internet Explorer. Last year, it released a major security update for Windows, Service Pack 2, to combat some of the security concerns. Longhorn is due to be released commercially in late 2006, but an updated version of Internet Explorer is due for release later this year. Comments are closed for this article.
Mido makes third apology Mido makes third apology Ahmed 'Mido' Hossam has made another apology to the Egyptian people in an attempt to rejoin the national team. The 21-year-old told a news conference in Cairo on Sunday that he is sorry for the problems that have led to his exclusion from the Pharaohs since July last year. Mido said: "There isn't much I have to say today, all there is to say is that I came specially from England to Egypt to rejoin the national team and to apologise for all my mistakes." Mido was axed by former coach Marco Tardelli after failing to answer a national call-up, claiming he had a groin injury. But he then played in a friendly for his club AS Roma within 24 hours of a World Cup qualifying match at home to Cameroon last September. Mido added: "It's not my right to give orders and say when I want to play ... at the same time I will always make sure that I put the national's team's matches as my top priority. "I feel that the national players are playing with a new spirit as I saw them play against Belgium (Egypt won 4-0 on Wednesday) and I simply want to add to their success. "I do confess that I was rude to the Egyptian press at times but now I have gained more experience and know that I will never go anywhere without the press's support. "Many of the international stars like David Beckham and (Zinedine) Zidane had the press opposing them. "So I'm now used to the fact that the press can be against me at times and I don't have to overreact when this happens. Meanwhile, Egypt FA spokesman Methat Shalaby welcomed the apology and said no one had exerted pressure on Mido to apologise. "Mido's apology today does not negatively affect Mido in anyway, on the contrary it makes him a bigger star and a role model for all football players," Shalaby said. Shalaby earlier said that after an apology Mido would be available for the national side if coach Hassan Shehata chose him. Mido joined Tottenham in an 18-month loan deal near the end of the January transfer window, scoring twice on his debut against Portsmouth. Return to results
Mobile multimedia slow to catch on Mobile multimedia slow to catch on There is no doubt that mobile phones sporting cameras and colour screens are hugely popular. Consumers swapping old phones for slinkier, dinkier versions are thought to be responsible for a 26% increase in the number of phones sold during the third quarter of 2004, according to analysts Gartner More than 167 million handsets were sold globally between July and September 2004, a period that, according to Gartner analyst Carolina Milanesi is "seldom strong". But although consumers have mobiles that can take and send snaps, sounds and video clips few, so far, are taking the chance to do so. In fact, the numbers of people not taking and sending pictures, audio and video is growing. Figures gathered by Continental Research shows that 36% of British camera phone users have never sent a multimedia message (MMS), up from 7% in 2003. This is despite the fact that, during the same period, the numbers of camera phones in the UK more than doubled to 7.5 million. Getting mobile phone users to send multimedia messages is really important for operators keen to squeeze more cash out of their customers and offset the cost of subsidising the handsets people are buying. The problem they face, said Shailendra Jain, head of MMS firm Adamind, is educating people in how to send the multimedia messages using their funky handsets. "Also," he said, "they have to simplify the interface so its not rocket science in terms of someone understanding it." Research bears out the suspicion that people are not sending multimedia messages because they do not know how to. According to Continental Research, 29% of the people it questioned said they were technophobes that tended to shy away from innovation. Only 11% regarded themselves as technically savvy enough to send a picture or video message. The fact that multimedia services are not interoperable across networks and phones only adds to people's reluctance to start sending them, said Mr Jain. "They ask themselves: 'If I'm streaming video from one handset to another will it work?'" he said. "There's a lot of user apprehension about that." There are other deeper technical reasons why multimedia messages are not being pushed as strongly as they might. Andrew Bud, executive chairman of messaging firm Mblox, said mobile phone operators cap the number of messages that can be circulating at any one time for fear of overwhelming the system. "The rate we can send MMS into the mobile network is fairly constant," he said. The reason for this is that there are finite capacities for data traffic on the second generation networks that currently have the most users. No-one wants to take the risk of swamping these relatively narrow channels so the number of MMS messages is capped, said Mr Bud. This has led to operators finding other technologies, particularly one known as Wap-push, to get multimedia to their customers. But when networks do find a good way to get multimedia to their customers, the results can be dramatic. Israeli technology firm Celltick has found a way to broadcast data across phone networks in a way that does not overwhelm existing bandwidth. One of the first firms to use the Celltick service is Hutch India, the largest mobile firm in the country. The broadcast system gets multimedia to customers via a rolling menu far faster than would be possible with other systems. While not multimedia messaging, such a system gets people used to seeing their phones as a device that can handle all different types of content. As a result 40% of the subscribers to the Hutch Alive, which uses Celltick's broadcast technology, regularly click for more pictures, sounds and images from the operator. "Operators really need to start utilising this tool to reach their customers," said Yaron Toren, spokesman for Celltick. Until then, multimedia will be a message that is not getting through.

More Africans for tsunami game More Africans for tsunami game Three more African stars have agreed to play in Fifa's Football for Hope match, organised to raise money for the victims of the Asian tsunami. Nigerian youngster Obafemi Martins and the Cameroon pair of Raymond Kalla and Rigobert Song have added their names to the six Africans who had already confirmed their participation in Tuesday's game in Barcelona. The Ivory Coast's Didier Drogba and Cameroon's Samuel Eto'o Fils will both be playing in the game rather than attending the Caf's Footballer of the Year award ceremony in South Africa. Both players are on the short list for Caf's 2004 Footballer of the Year award along with Nigeria's Jay-Jay Okocha. As well as Drogba and Eto'o, who is the reigning African Footballer of the Year, Cameroon goalkeeper Carlos Idriss Kameni, Tunisia's Rahdi Jaidi and veteran defenders Samuel Kuffour of Ghana and South Africa's Lucas Radebe will all be playing. Africa is represented among the officials for the game with Jason Damoo of the Seychelles named as one of the assistant referees for the game. However one African star who will miss the clash is Ghana's Michael Essien, whose French club Lyon refused to release him and two other players. There are also several players with African roots set to play in the match with French stars Zinedine Zidane and Patrick Vieira and Belgium's Vincent Kompany among those confirmed by Fifa. The two captains for the game will be Brazil's World Footballer of the Year, Ronaldinho and Ukraine's European Footballer of the Year, Andriy Shevchenko. Comments are closed for this article.
Morientes admits to Reds struggle Morientes admits to Reds struggle Liverpool striker Fernando Morientes has admited he is struggling to adapt to life in the Premiership. The Spain interational has played twice for the club, losing both times, since his Â£6.3m move from Real Madrid. "I am finding it hard to adapt but I am better now," the 28-year-old told Marca newspaper. "It's surprising when you see things you are not used to. "I am starting to get to know things, and my wife is looking for a house and a school for the kids." Morientes admitted his difficulty with the English language "worries me" but that having a Spanish manager in Rafael Benitez has helped his cause. "I can understand everything and that is a relief," he said. Despite his concerns, he said he was relishing the move and said there was a "certain magic" about Anfield, which was far calmer than the Bernabeu. Since his arrival, Liverpool have lost 1-0 to Manchester United and 2-0 Southampton in the league, while he watched from the bench as Burnley knocked them out of the FA Cup. But he expects both the manager and the players to turn things around. "The team has had a lot of changes and injuries and that is a handicap when you are looking for results but I am confident we will go a long way," he said. "When you sign a coach like Benitez it is to let him work with a long-term view and that is what is happening. "We are a historic club and fifth in the table but that is not a problem. The confidence that you get given here is incredible." Return to results
Motherâs ordeal suggests A&E system may be beyond repair Motherâs ordeal suggests A&E system may be beyond repair Nan Collins waited eight hours before anyone even checked to see if she was concussed Nan Collins waiting for treatment in the A&E department at Dublinâs Mater hospital. Photograph: John Collins On a recent Friday night, as my colleague Conor Popeâs Magazine feature on his overnight shift in the A&E department at St Jamesâs Hospital was hitting the streets, my motherâs eight-hour quest for treatment in an acute Dublin hospital was coming to an end. Nan Collins (77) has reduced vision due to age-related macular degeneration, an eye condition that affects one in 10 people over the age of 50. On Friday, September 20th, she tripped in a car park at Dublin Airport. When I met her shortly afterwards she had a serious-looking wound on her forehead and was nursing her right wrist. My immediate instinct was to get her to the nearest A&E department, in the Mater hospital. Big mistake. It was mid-afternoon on a Friday, so we naively thought it wouldnât take long for her to be treated. Not having a medical card, she was asked to pay a non-refundable â¬100 fee on arrival, before getting any indication of the possible waiting time. She was seen by a nurse just after 5pm, an hour after we arrived, and at 8pm, after I asked could she see a nurse again. The hours passed in a blur â thereâs not much to distract you, and you spend the time oscillating between worry about your relative and anger at the inefficiency of the system. By 11pm Iâd had enough and got through to the nursesâ station and successfully pleaded my motherâs case. We were brought into a side ward where, almost eight hours after arriving, my mother began to be monitored to check whether she had concussion. Just after 2am, it was confirmed Nan had broken her wrist, and would be kept in A&E overnight for a CT scan the next morning. Infuriatingly, my motherâs experience is by no means unique. The Materâs new A&E department opened last February as part of a â¬284 million extension to the hospital. One newspaper report suggested âpatients will receive treatment faster and more effectively and their dignity and comfort will be ensured in the bigger, better buildingâ. None of that was in evidence during our visit. Getting into A&E is tricky. There are very few signs inside or outside the building. However, there are signs suggesting how to interact with staff, how to pay the â¬100 fee and why it canât be refunded even if you donât see a medic. Drug treatment We didnât see enhanced facilities in the waiting area, unless you count the vending machines stocked with chocolate bars and undrinkable coffee. There are recharging units for mobile phones â at â¬2 a shot â confirmation that any visit here is likely to be a lengthy one. .

Much done to address business concerns Much done to address business concerns A shopper watching the Minister for Public Expenditure & Reform Brendan Howlin addressing the house, in a Dublin city store on Budget 2014. Photograph: Eric Luke Feargal O'Rourke This was our seventh austerity budget and according to Minister for Finance Michael Noonan , â Ireland is open for businessâ, it wants to âplay fair and play to winâ, and it âis to be part of the solution to the global tax challenge and not part of the problemâ. Noonan confirmed the Governmentâs commitment to the 12.5 per cent rate and moreover included this commitment as part of Irelandâs International Tax Charter, notwithstanding coalition discussions in Germany . This is what the FDI sector needs to hear right now. From a reputational perspective, he confirmed Irelandâs active participation in OECD and EU initiatives. He committed to deal with the issue of âstatelessâ companies in the upcoming Finance Bill. This budget required â¬2.5 billion consisting of expenditure cuts and tax increases to be taken out of our economy. This yearâs tax savingsâ requirement was made easier than previous budgets in that Noonan could point to savings coming forward from last year. These comprised, among others, the effect of a full yearâs Local Property Tax, increases in capital tax rates and a pension adjustment. This latter change was signalled with the intention to cut tax advantages in funding pensions. The main question was how this was to be done, which was answered in the form of the maximum fund that could be built up tax efficiently being reduced from â¬2.3 million to â¬2 million. Entrepreneurial budget This budget was signalled as an entrepreneurial budget and it made some inroads there with the adjustment to the R&D credit to allow additional outsourcing to help smaller companies and indeed the two-year income tax exemption for certain start-ups will be welcomed. A new relief from Capital Gains Tax on reinvestment of previous asset disposals in new productive trading activity should be well received. Further, the removal of the Employment and Investment Incentive (EII) from the high earnerâs restriction has been on entrepreneursâ shopping list for some time and will be welcomed. The hospitality sectorâs VAT reduction to 9 per cent was previously introduced as a temporary measure and has been regarded as a positive move. In a response to a recent DÃ¡il question, Noonan referred to the impact of the low VAT rate on the tourism sector noting that the most recent data available related to 2012 and shows a year-on- year growth for the accommodation and food services sector compared to 2011. There were musings that the original rate would be restored given that the reduction had done its job but Noonan left it as is to âreinforce success when possibleâ. The construction sector, which saw its first growth for some years, received a number of incentives. The homeowners income tax credit of 13.5 per cent on certain improvement expenditures on their home may encourage such owners to release some of their savings and invest in their home. The measures to enhance our current Real Estate Investment Trusts by allowing their inclusion as an investment option in the Immigrant Investor Programme, while welcome, could be taken further. City initiatives Last yearâs budget brought about tax relief under the City Living Initiative for certain expenditure on properties in Limerick and Waterford . This year it is being extended to certain properties in Cork, Galway , Kilkenny and Dublin. Indeed, extending the exemption from Capital Gains Tax for the purchase of property held for seven years to property acquired in 2014 will be particularly welcomed. The absence of any specific measures to bolster the competitiveness of our international financial services sector is somewhat disappointing, as was the bank levy and indeed the additional pension levy. It is hoped that the upcoming Finance Bill (due out on the 24th of this month) will address some of the specific requests made by various industry groups. Seven austerity budgets; maybe weâre done? Next yearâs GDP growth target of 2 per cent on which this is predicated is ambitious. Fingers crossed! Comments are closed for this article.
Musical future for phones Musical future for phones Analyst Bill Thompson has seen the future and it is in his son's hands. I bought my son Max a 3G phone, partly because they are so cheap and he needed a phone, and partly because I am supposed to know about the latest technology and thought I should see how they work in real life. After using it for a while I am not at all tempted to get rid of my SonyEricsson P800 smart phone. That has a relatively large screen, even if it does only have slower GPRS access to the network. I can read my e-mail, surf the web using a proper browser and write stuff using the stylus on its touch screen. Last week someone e-mailed me a document that had been compressed into a ZIP file, and I was pleasantly surprised to discover that my phone even knew how to decompress it for me. By contrast the confusing menus, complicated keyboard and truly irritating user interface of Max's 3G phone simply get in the way, and I did not see much value in the paid-for services, especially the limited web access. The videos of entertainment news, horoscopes and the latest celebrity gossip did not appeal, and I did not see how the small screen could be useful for any sort of image, never mind micro-TV. But then Max started playing, and I realised I was missing the point entirely. It is certainly not a great overall experience, but that is largely due to the poor menu system and the phone layout: the video content itself is compelling. The quality was at least as good as the video streaming from the Online News website, and the image is about the same size. Max was completely captivated, and I was intrigued to discover that I had nearly missed the next stage of the network revolution. It is easy to be dismissive of small screens, and indeed anyone of my generation, with failing eyesight and the view that 'there's never anything worth watching on TV', is hardly going to embrace these phones. But just as the World Wide Web was the "killer application" that drove internet adoption, music videos are going to drive 3G adoption. With Vodafone now pushing its own 3G service, and 3 already established in the UK, video on the phone is clearly going to become a must-have for kids sitting on the school bus, adults waiting outside clubs and anyone who has time to kill and a group of friends to impress. This will please the network operators, who are looking for some revenue from their expensively acquired 3G licences. But it goes deeper than that: playing music videos on a phone marks the beginning of a move away from the 'download and play' model we have all accepted for our iPods and MP3 players. After all, why should I want to carry 60GB of music and pictures around with me in my pocket when I can simply listen to anything I want, whenever I want, streamed to my phone? Oh - and of course you can always use the phone to make voice calls and send texts, something which ensures that it is always in someone's pocket or handbag, available for other uses too. I have never really approved of using the Internet Protocol (IP), to do either audio or video streaming, and I think that technically it is a disaster to make phone calls over the net using "voice over IP". But I have to acknowledge that the net, at least here in the developed Western countries, is fast and reliable enough to do both. I stream radio to my computer while I work, and enjoy hearing the bizarre stations from around the world that I can find online but nowhere else. I am even playing with internet telephony, despite my reservations, and I appear on Go Digital on the World Service, streamed over the web each week. But 3G networks have been designed to do this sort of streaming, both for voice and video, which gives them an edge over net-based IP services. The 3G services aren't quite there yet, and there is a lot to be sorted out when it comes to web access and data charges. Vodafone will let you access its services on Vodafone Live! as part of your subscription cost but it makes you pay by the megabyte to download from other sites - this one, for example. This will not matter to business users, but will distort the consumer market and keep people within the phone company's collection of partner sites, something that should perhaps be worrying telecoms regulator Ofcom. But we should not see these new phones simply as cut-down network terminals. If I want fast access to my e-mail I can get a 3G card for my laptop or hook up to a wireless network. The phone is a lot more, and it is as a combination of mini-TV, personal communications device and music/video player that it really works. There is certainly room in the technology ecosystem for many different sorts of devices, accessing a wide range of services over different networks. 3G phones and iPods can co-exist, at least for a while, but if I had to bet on the long term I would go for content on demand over carrying gigabytes in my pocket. Or perhaps some enterprising manufacturer will offer me both. An MP3G player, anyone? Bill Thompson is a regular commentator on the Online News World Service programme Go Digital.

Nearly a third of 34 OECD states see drop in health spend Nearly a third of 34 OECD states see drop in health spend Health spending per capita decreased by 6.6% in Ireland between 2009 and 2011, behind only Greece, which saw a 11.1% drop The OECD said the drop in Irelandâs health spending reflected âsubstantial reformsâ undertaken here, by it, including cuts to the prices paid for health care, such as wages and pharmaceuticals. Almost a third of the 34 OECD countries witnessed a drop in health spending between 2009 and 2011, with Greece and Ireland experiencing the largest fall in per capita annual health expenditure. This is according to a comprehensive overview of health issues across the world published today. Health spending per capita fell by 6.6 per cent in Ireland between 2009 and 2011, the biggest drop in any country other than Greece, where it dropped by 11.1 per cent, according to the OECDâs Health at a Glance 2013 report. The OECD said the drop in Irelandâs health spending reflected âsubstantial reformsâ undertaken here, including cuts to the prices paid for healthcare, such as wages and pharmaceuticals. Generic drugs However despite this, Ireland ranked badly when it came to the use of generic drugs â only 18 per cent of the volume of pharmaceuticals prescribed in Ireland in 2011 were generics compared to 75 per cent in the UK and 76 per cent in Germany. Only Italy and Luxembourg fared worse across 19 OECD countries. The OECD report notes that growth in health spending has âslowed markedlyâ in almost all OECD countries since the start of the downturn in 2008. Average health spending across 32 of the OECD countries grew by just 0.2 per cent between 2009 and 2011 after a decade where the annual average growth rate in per capita health expenditure stood at over 4 per cent per year. Apart from Greece and Ireland, other countries which witnessed a drop in health spending between 2009 and 2011 included Iceland (-3.8 per cent), Estonia (3 per cent), Portugal (2.2 per cent) and the UK (1.8 per cent). The report said the cuts in health spending had been reached by targeting hospital spending, cuts to wages and expenditure on prevention and public health while âin several OECD countries, patients are now expected to assume a greater share of health costsâ. Healthcare targeted An editorial prefacing the report states: âThe shift towards restoring sound fiscal conditions has often implied substantial cuts in public spending. Like other government programmes, healthcare has been the target of spending cuts in many OECD countriesâ. The report states that âin a climate of fiscal restraint and efficiency efforts, health expenditure growth should be more aligned to a countryâs economic growth and its ability to raise revenue,â which was not the case before the economic downturn. Structural reforms It adds that the economic crisis has âpushed many countries to undertake structural reforms of their health systems. âGovernments must continue to seek clever ways by which health systems can continue to improve the well-being of patients within the new fiscal environment.â It says that countries can make further gains in patient safety, thereby reducing costs and health burdens, while care quality can also be improved by strengthening primary care systems to better manage complex cases.

New offices in Texas and Istanbul for Enterprise Ireland New offices in Texas and Istanbul for Enterprise Ireland Move will offer support to Irish companies looking to export into these regions Turkey offers significant export opportunities for a growing number of Irish companies. Enterprise Ireland is to open two new offices in Austin, Texas in the US and Istanbul, Turkey. According to Enterprise Ireland, the new office openings follow extensive research, the completion of successful trade missions and increased client demand, confirming the benefit of these new offices to support Irish companies target export opportunities in both markets. Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation Richard Bruton said that the two markets hold âenormous potentialâ for Irish companies. âWhen I travelled to Texas earlier this year for a trade mission with 40 dynamic Irish companies I was blown away by the opportunities that exist and the success that some Irish companies have achieved there. Todayâs announcement will mean that Irish companies in these two markets have top-class access to Enterprise Irelandâs suite of supports, networks and contacts, and will provide a real boost for exports and ultimately jobs in Irelandâ.According to Enterprise Ireland, the scope of opportunity for Irish companies seeking to expand their exports to the southern states of the USA is âsubstantialâ, with the scale of individual southern states the equivalent of developed economies. Texas is the 15th largest economy in the world and has been identified as a state with a high concentration of businesses which represent the best match for the capability of Enterprise Ireland clients. These include computer technology and communications equipment, energy and cleantech, medical devices/lifesciences, engineering /material handling. Turkey has also emerged as a market offering significant export opportunities for a growing number of Irish companies. Turkey is forecast to be the fastest growing economy among members of the OECD between 2011-2017 with an annual growth rate of 6.7 per cent. It is a substantial economy in its own right and is the gateway to opportunities in the greater Eurasian market with a population of 220 million people. Enterprise Ireland has identified the sectors offering the best potential and match for Irish companiesâ capability as ICT and telecoms, pharma/ process engineering, engineering, financial services, and international education.

Noonan says decision on exit strategy remains âfinely balancedâ Noonan says decision on exit strategy remains âfinely balancedâ Minister for Finance Michael Noonan held his final meeting with senior figures from the EU and IMF yesterday in the Netherlands Sources in Brussels now expect Ireland to exit the bailout without a backstop in place. Officials believe that if Ireland deploys a one-year credit line, it will confront the same issue of market confidence when that credit line expires in a yearâs time. With market conditions currently favourable, and Irish bond yields hovering at 3.5 per cent, it is seen as preferable for Ireland to return to fully fledged market financing now rather than at a later juncture. A final decision on a request for a precautionary credit line may be made as early as next week, amid increasing signs that Brussels is prepared to back Ireland if it decides to exit its EU-IMF programme unaided. Hour-long meeting Both finance ministers described the hour-long meeting at the Dutch finance ministry as âconstructive.â While Mr Noonan said yesterday evening the decision on an exit strategy remained âfinely balancedâ. Unlike three years ago, at the time of the Irish bailout when contagion across peripheral countries was a primary concern, the decoupling of Irish government bond yields from the yields of other programme countries such as Greece and Portugal over the last year is assuaging concerns about contagion should Irelandâs return to full private funding spark market unrest. The fact that a request to draw down a precautionary credit line from the euro zone rescue fund, the European Stability Mechanism (ESM), would need parliamentary approval from a number of countries, including Germany , is also weighing on the decision. EU commissioner Olli Rehn said yesterday that while the decision on an exit strategy was âby and large for the Irish Governmentâ, Ireland was well-funded. âThe Irish sovereign is now well-funded with quite significant cash reserves that serve as a buffer,â the commissioner for economic and monetary affairs said, adding that Ireland was seen as âan economic turnaround,â with growth returning and improvements in the unemployment rate. Mr Rehn said last month that Ireland had a âvery good chanceâ of exiting the bailout without a precautionary credit line. Mr Noonan took some analysts by surprise last month when he told the Fine Gael annual conference that Ireland may exit the bailout without a backstop mechanism. Sentiment in Washington He repeated the sentiment in Washington last week following a meeting at IMF headquarters. Since then Irish bond spreads have narrowed, suggesting the prospect of Ireland exiting unsupported may not trouble investors. While Ireland is the first country to exit a joint euro zone-IMF rescue package â a landmark for the euro zone â a number of countries have exited IMF programmes without the use of a precautionary credit line. With the final troika visit to Dublin due to finish tomorrow, Mr Noonan may make a decision before next Thursdayâs meeting of all 17 euro zone finance ministers, in Brussels. Any decision on a precautionary credit line will be first brought to Cabinet in Dublin before being discussed by the euro group of finance ministers. Return to results
North investment conference targets investors from emerging markets North investment conference targets investors from emerging markets Initiative follows Cameron pledge at G8 summit to help rebalance local economy First Minister Peter Robinson and Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness, pictured at the Gala Dinner at Hillsborough Castle last nigth with entrepreneurÂ Orlagh McGahan. Dan Keenan More than 150 potential overseas and domestic investors gather in Hillsborough Castle tonight at the invitation of Northern Secretary Theresa Villiers in advance of tomorrowâs special investment conference in Belfast . The event comprises investors, ambassadors and government officials from 16 countries from the worldâs leading and emerging economies, reflecting the Stormont Executiveâs drive for foreign direct investment from growing markets in Asia and South America . The investment conference will be addressed by British prime minister David Cameron as well as Peter Robinson and Martin McGuinness . Enterprise minister Arlene Foster will follow addresses by the First Minister and Deputy First Minister and introduce a list of speakers representing organisations which have already invested in Northern Ireland . The conference, to be hosted at Titanic Belfast in the cityâs docklands, will then move into private session with potential investors joining workshops to discover that the region has to offer. Sectors represented include financial and business services, ICT, creative industries, advanced engineering and renewables. During the afternoon delegates will have the opportunity to take part in workshops relating to key sectors â advanced manufacturing, aerospace, financial services and technology, ICT and the creative industries. A closing reception will be staged at Stormontâs Parliament Buildings. Taking part in the workshops will be Jay Roewe , executive vice-president, HBO ; Karl May , co-founder, president and CEO, Vello Systems; Libby Jackson , director of Belfast, Herbert Smith Freehills; Suren Gupta , executive vice-president, technology and operations, Allstate ; Andrew Brammer,head of support services centre, Allen and Overy; David Beatty , managing director of Thales in Belfast; Bill Smith , executive director, business development, Aerojet Rocketdyne; Jeff LaCroix, vice-president of operations, recording head division, Seagate ; Alistair Niederer , CEO - UK, Ireland & South Africa , Teleperformance ; Craig Rinehardt , executive vice-president of Global Operations, Terumo BCT; Leigh Meyer , managing director, Global FX & Money Market Operations , Citi ; Graham Sutherland , CEO, BT Business; and Duncan Tait : CEO UK & Ireland and chairman, FTEL Fujitsu. Organised by InvestNI on behalf of the Stormont Executive, the investment conference follows a commitment made at the G8 summit, held in Fermanagh in June, at which Mr Cameron pledged his support. The initiative is in tune with the Executiveâs established policy of growing Northern Irelandâs relatively small private sector and ârebalancingâ the economy away from public spending. It also reflects the aims of the Economic Pact, agreed with the British government by Mr Robinson and Mr McGuinness earlier this year. Mr Robinson said: âLast weekâs announcement of 1,000 new jobs by USA company Stream demonstrate our ability to attract international foreign investment. The progress in the Economic Pact shows our commitment to a long-term stable future and to our economic growth.â Mr McGuinness added: âWe want to reach out to emerging economies, many of which are represented at this weekâs investment conference. We are eager to encourage good government relations and promote trade and investment links. Plans to open a bureau office in Beijing early next year are progressing well. This will undoubtedly strengthen relations with China and develop mutually beneficial opportunities for partnership collaborations.â ends Comments are closed for this article.
O'Driscoll concern at Fifa ruling O'Driscoll concern at Fifa ruling Bournemouth boss Sean O'Driscoll is concerned at the impact that the transfer window system could make, if it is applied to Football League clubs next season. The League was recently informed by Fifa that its 72 clubs would no longer receive any further dispensation to trade players outside the world governing body's transfer windows after the end of the current campaign. The matter will now be discussed at the next meeting of all clubs on 10 March - when a League working party set up to consider the implications of Fifa's decision is set to report back. The clubs will then decide on the next step to take, League communications executive Ian Christon confirmed. If it is applied to the Football League, O'Driscoll feels the Fifa-imposed system could harm the chances for young players at Premiership clubs to gain experience in the lower leagues. When injuries have struck, O'Driscoll has used the short-term loan market to bolster his small squad - a move which is not possible under the "window" ruling which currently just applies to the Premiership, and prevents the transfer of players during the season - except during the month of January. "I don't think it benefits anyone in the football industry in England," the Cherries boss told Online News Sport. "We took John Spicer from Arsenal this season, while [last Saturday's opponents] Oldham have taken a few, including Neil Kilkenny from Birmingham. "Kilkenny looks a really good player but was never going to play in the Premiership, so where will these players go? If you don't have the finance to buy them, they get stuck in the reserves. "I watch an awful lot of reserve team games, and you can tell the players who have been there too long, as it doesn't motivate them and they go through the motions. "It becomes extremely difficult to try and pick them, as you think 'if I get him out of there, could he cope in the Football League?' - so it doesn't benefit the big clubs, and doesn't benefit the small clubs. "We've got to come in line with the rest of Europe, but it'll cause us major problems as we live on a knife-edge." However, O'Driscoll accepts that with the loan market blocked, clubs such as Bournemouth will have to look to their own youth ranks when injuries begin to bite. "The better youth systems will play an important part, and you'll have even younger boys being part of the first-team squad," he explained. "We've got two 17-year-olds in our squad who've come through the youth system [James Coutts and James Rowe] and I'm sure we'll have four or five next year - just so they can train with the first team. "Next year, if needed, you're going to have to throw them in - even if you have the finance to bring in a loan player, you won't be allowed. "I think there will be a mad scramble, come the end of the transfer window, to strengthen squads."
One million face higher health insurance, industry claims One million face higher health insurance, industry claims Health insurers call for review of tax relief cap introduced in Budget On the day of the budget, Minister for Finance Michael Noonan capped the amount of premium on which tax relief is available to â¬1,000 per adult and â¬500 per child. Photograph: Aidan Crawley Carl O'Brien, Arthur Beesley Health insurers have urged the Government to review the changes in tax relief on private health policies announced in this weekâs budget, which will raise costs for hundreds of thousands of people. The insurance companies claimed the Government had made a âfundamental miscalculationâ about the number of people affected. While Minister for Finance Michael Noonan said changes would only hit people on âgold-platedâ policies, the insurance industry last night estimated that as many as one million customers will face average increases of as much as 8 per cent, or â¬100 each. However, the Government was last night standing firm, insisting that there would be no change in policy. The move has caused confusion since it came into effect this week, with the four main insurers â VHI, Aviva, Laya and GloHealth â scrambling to change the prices of their policies overnight. Downgrading policies Some industry commentators claim the move will lead to an acceleration in numbers leaving health insurance or downgrading policies, placing increased strain on both public and private hospitals. Mr Noonan said the Revenue Commissioners had estimated in the run-up to the budget that 577,000 people would be affected â a figure endorsed by the Health Insurance Authority , the market regulator. Many of the policyholders, Mr Noonan added, would lose tax relief on only a small amount of their premiums. On budget day, Mr Noonan capped the amount of premium on which tax relief is available to â¬1,000 per adult and â¬500 per child. He said at the time this would ânot affect the majority of individuals who avail of more standard levels of medical coverâ. A spokesman for Mr Noonan last night said the policy will not be changed, but officials were willing to meet representatives of the insurance industry to discuss technical aspects of how the rate change would be implemented. In a statement, the Department of Finance said many policyholders will be only marginally affected and customers could âshop aroundâ for cheaper cover, using the Health Insurance Authorityâs website. But the authority yesterday said its website was still being updated and new premium costs would not be available for at least 24 hours. The departmentâs statement said the âvast majorityâ of families with standard premiums would not be affected by the changes and would continue to receive tax relief towards the cost of their private health insurance. It pointed out that, for example, a family of two adults and two children with a gross premium for their health insurance policy of â¬3,000 will continue to receive the tax relief at source of 20 per cent, which is worth â¬600. âProgressiveâ It said the measure was progressive in that those who pay the most for health insurance will bear the brunt of the impact. Health insurance tax relief last year cost the exchequer some â¬500 million. âIntroducing an upper ceiling on this relief is intended to ensure continuing support, via the tax system, for those who purchase standard but good policies, while reducing exchequer exposure to the more expensive policies,â the statement said. .

Organisation calls on Government to revise budget measures Organisation calls on Government to revise budget measures INMO general secretary Liam Doran said frontline health services are under âreal strainâ due to lack of resources Photograph: Eric Luke/The Online News The health service will become âwholly inadequateâ following budget cuts of â¬666 million, the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation has warned. The organisation this morning said patient care will be âseverely compromisedâ following a sixth consecutive year of cutbacks. They also claimed the Government has refused to introduce adequate revenue raising, public health measures on tobacco products, alcohol and sugary drinks. âThe inevitable outcome of these two contradictory strategies will be a wholly inadequate, and underfunded, health service unable to cope with the demands of a population,â the INMO said in a statement. The organisation will discuss the budget measures at a special delegate conference in Croke Park tomorrow. Their criticism comes amid mounting pressure on Minister for Health James Reilly over the extent of the health service cutbacks. The Online News reported on Saturday that the level of cuts could reach â¬1 billion if promised but unfunded developments were to be implemented while new figures to be published later this week will show that health services recorded a financial overrun of â¬71.987 million to the end of August. The INMO said the budget cuts will see a further reduction in staffing numbers of 2,000 on top of a reduction of 10,000 over the past five years. Consequently, âsafe care through safe practice will not be possible as we move through 2014â. The organisation said increased levies on tobacco, beer, and sugary drinks could bring in some â¬180 million a year, generating âthe necessary revenue to maintain our public health serviceâ. But it suggested that âvested interested behind these industriesâ were obstructing proper health planning. It added that a 1 per cent increase on the temporarily lowered VAT rate on restaurants and hotels would raise almost â¬100 million. âThe health service in the frontline is now very efficient but under real strain due to lack of resources,â said INMO general secretary, Liam Doran . âIt is not a âblack holeâ and the government should not be swayed by others who, to protect their massive profits, resist any new/additional taxes or levies on their products even though they lead to cancer, obesity and anti-social behaviour.â Mr Doran added that the INMO will seek alliances with other expert groups involved in public health and call on the Government to revise its policies in the area. Separately, the National Association of General Practitioners has said doctors may not agree to operate a free scheme for children aged five and under. âWe thought in good faith they were going to announce a scheme that was likely to deliver a high-end service,â the organisationâs chairman Dr Andrew Jordan told RTÃâs Morning Ireland. âUnfortunately a figure of â¬37m was rolled out. Of course we realised this was just an extension of the present GMS which is not a top-end service.â Return to results
Parry puts Gerrard 'above money' Parry puts Gerrard 'above money' Listen to the full interview on Sport on Five and the Online News Sport website from 1900 GMT. But Parry, speaking exclusively to Online News Sport, also admits Gerrard, who has been constantly linked with Chelsea, will have the final say on his future. He told Online News Five Live: "Steven is above money. He is the future of Liverpool. "It doesn't matter if it's Â£30m, Â£40m or Â£50m, we will not accept offers. But we are also realistic enough to know we can't keep Steven against his will." On the subject of Liverpool's finances, Parry also revealed the club is ready to explore the possibility of a sponsorship deal for its proposed new stadium. And responding to criticism from Online News Sport pundit and former Liverpool stalwart Alan Hansen, he insisted talks on new investment are ongoing, but added the door has not closed on shareholder and lifelong fan Steve Morgan. Parry joined Liverpool as chief executive in July 1998 from a similar role at the Premier League. There have been several highs and lows during his time in charge at Anfield - and he had a busy summer, overseeing the arrival of new manager Rafael Benitez and managing to hold on to Steven Gerrard. On the subject of Liverpool's captain and prize asset, Parry revealed Real Madrid did ask for an option on the England midfield man during negotiations for striker Fernando Morientes. He said: "They were looking for ways of saying they got more out of the deal for Fernando Morientes, but the response to Real Madrid was the same - Steven is not for sale." But when asked if Gerrard would be a Liverpool player on the first day of next season, Parry said: "I sincerely hope he will be. Steven knows my views. He knows Rafa's views. "We have re-affirmed recently to Steven that we are trying to build a team around him. We crave success as much as he does. We know he's ambitious and nobody can argue with that. "I think Steven would dearly love to win things with Liverpool more than he'd like to do anything else. "We all want to see progress by next season. He's not alone in that. There are a lot of other players who feel the same, so we all have a common aim." It is expected Chelsea will test Liverpool with a Â£30m-plus bid in the summer - but Parry claims he will be in no mood to listen. "There have been a lot of open secrets about Steven, most of which have been complete myths. It is suggested we had a deal tied up last summer. We didn't had an offer last summer," Parry explained. "We had told Chelsea that as far as we were concerned he was not for sale and we didn't want to sell him. In reality it didn't go beyond that. "Maybe there will be an offer in the summer. Maybe there won't. "Our position is we want Steven to stay, but we are also realistic enough and have enough respect for Steven - and he has enough respect for us - to know that it is his decision that will be crucial. "You are not going to keep a player like Steven against his will. That just doesn't work, but any idea we are going to accept offers for Steven and then tell him 'by the way we've decided to sell you' is not on the agenda. You can forget that." Parry is currently in the process of finalising funding for Liverpool's new stadium in Stanley Park, which is set to open in 2007. And he confessed Arsenal's Â£100m deal with Emirates to sponsor their new ground - complete with naming rights - has given the Anfield club serious food for thought. He said: "I have to say historically it is something I have been against, and I have been on record as saying that, but I think the size of the Arsenal deal is a real eye-opener. "I would say in the past deals have been done frankly far too cheaply and it just hasn't even been worth contemplating. "But the Arsenal deal is the sort of deal that causes you to draw breath and say 'wow - that's interesting.' "My personal point of view is that I would find it a hell of a lot more palatable than a shared stadium." Some Liverpool fans would find such a move highly controversial, but Parry countered: "I recognise it would be an emotive issue for many supporters, but you look at the amount of money available and it could go into the team. "If it was the right partner how strong an issue is it? Time will tell. "I think the stadium will always be Anfield, not least because of where it is, but do we need to investigate the possibilities of sponsorship? I think it would be remiss not to. "That's not to say we have made a decision that we will go down that road, but I think it is clearly something we have to explore." On the subject of possible new investment, Parry revealed Liverpool are still in negotiations with a mystery investor, with rumours of interest from the Middle East. That prompted the withdrawal of tycoon Steve Morgan, who got frustrated by failed bids and what he claimed was indecision by the board. He also accused Liverpool of using him as "a stalking horse" to attract other bids, but Parry explained: "Steve has never been used as a stalking horse. There's no need, and that is not the way we do business. "We had discussions with Steve over the course of 2004. I think we came close to concluding a deal in the summer but it didn't happen. "Quite genuinely, the new interest did appear relatively late in the day just prior to the AGM in December, and as I have said it was of such potential magnitude, and that potential is so exciting, we felt we had to evaluate it. We are still evaluating it. "Steve's interest was taken very much on its own merits. His enthusiasm for the club is there for all to see and who knows what the next few months will hold? "The door isn't closed on anything. We had a perfectly sensible dialogue with Steve last year. "We have a common interest in making Liverpool successful. That's a dream we all share, so as far as I'm concerned the door is not closed." I would take Â£50m if we had no investment, but if we did, keep him. As for the stadium, if it gets us cash what difference does it make really? Â£50m for Gerrard? I don't care who you are, the Directors would take the money and it is the way it should be. We cannot let that sum of money go, despite Gerrard's quality. Through a cleverly worded statement, the club has effectively forced Gerrard to publicly make the decision for himself, which I think is the right thing to do. Critical time for Liverpool with regards to Gerrard. Ideally we would want to secure his future to the club for the long term. I am hoping he doesn't walk out of the club like Michael Owen did for very little cash. Â£50m realistically would allow Rafa to completely rebuild the squad, however, if we can afford to do this AND keep Gerrard we will be better for it. I would however be happy with Gerrard's transfer for any fee over Â£35m. Parry's statements are clever in that any future Gerrard transfer cannot be construed as a lack of ambition by the club to not try and keep their best players. Upping the ante is another smart move by Parry. I would keep Gerrard. No amount of money could replace his obvious love of the club and determination to succeed. The key is if Gerrard comes out and says that he is happy. Clearly, if he isn't, then we would be foolish not to sell. The worrying thing is who would you buy (or who would come) pending possible non-Champions League football. Return to results
Pompeii gets digital make-over Pompeii gets digital make-over The old-fashioned audio tour of historical places could soon be replaced with computer-generated images that bring the site to life. A European Union-funded project is looking at providing tourists with computer-augmented versions of archaeological attractions. It would allow visitors a glimpse of life as it was originally lived in places such as Pompeii. It could pave the way for a new form of cultural tourism. The technology would allow digital people and other computer-generated elements to be combined with the actual view seen by tourists as they walk around an historical site. The Lifeplus project is part of the EU's Information Society Technologies initiative aimed at promoting user-friendly technology and enhancing European cultural heritage. Engineers and researchers working in the Europe-wide consortium have come up with a prototype augmented-reality system. It would require the visitor to wear a head-mounted display with a miniature camera and a backpack computer. The camera captures the view and feeds it to software on the computer where the visitor's viewpoint is combined with animated virtual elements. At Pompeii for example, the visitor would not just see the frescos, taverns and villas that have been excavated, but also people going about their daily life. Augmented reality has been used to create special effects in films such as Troy and Lord of the Rings and in computer gaming. "This technology can now be used for much more than just computer games," said Professor Nadia Magnenat-Thalman of the Swiss research group MiraLab. "We are, for the first time, able to run this combination of software processes to create walking, talking people with believable clothing, skin and hair in real-time," she said. Unlike virtual reality, which delivers an entirely computer-generated scene to the viewer, the Lifeplus project is about combining digital and real views. Crucial to the technique is the software that interprets the visitor's view and provides an accurate match between the real and virtual elements. The software capable of doing this has been developed by a UK company, 2d3. Andrew Stoddart, chief scientist at 2d3, said that the EU project has been driven by a new desire to bring the past to life. "The popularity of television documentaries and dramatisations using computer-generated imagery to recreate scenes from ancient history demonstrates the widespread appeal of bringing ancient cultures to life," he said.

Presidentâs nominee to âpromote employment, stable prices, sound financial systemâ Presidentâs nominee to âpromote employment, stable prices, sound financial systemâ US president Barack Obama applauds after announcing his nomination of Janet Yellen to head the Federal Reserve at the White House in Washington yesterday. Photograph: Jonathan Ernst/Online News Federal Reserve vice chair Janet Yellen , president Barack Obamaâs pick to lead the US central bank, said yesterday that strengthening the economic recovery and boosting employment would be priorities if she is confirmed as Fed leader. MsYellen, an advocate of the central bankâs aggressive actions to stimulate economic growth through low interest rates and large-scale bond purchases, would replace Fed chairman Ben Bernanke , whose second term ends on January 31st. The nomination would put Ms Yellen on course to be the first woman to lead the institution and the first to head a central bank in any Group of Seven industrial nation. At a White House ceremony where Mr Obama announced her nomination, Ms Yellen said she would promote maximum employment, stable prices, and a sound financial system as the top US central banker and noted there was more to do to ensure people who were out of work could find jobs. âWhile we have made progress, we have farther to go. The mandate of the Federal Reserve is to serve all the American people, and too many Americans still canât find a job and worry how theyâll pay their bills and provide for their families,â the 67-year-old former professor said. Ms Yellen will provide continuity with the policies the Bernanke-led Fed has pursued, and is likely to move cautiously in reining in the extensive monetary stimulus the central bank put in place to shore up the worldâs largest economy. Her fealty to the extraordinary policy tactics the Fed employed in an effort to beat back the 2007-2009 recession and spur faster job growth concerns some Republican who fear the measures will unleash inflation or fuel asset bubbles. Despite such opposition, Ms Yellen has strong support from fellow Democrats and is expected to be confirmed by the Senate . âJanet is exceptionally well qualified for this role,â Mr Obama said with a beaming Ms Yellen by his side. âShe doesnât have a crystal ball, but what she does have is a keen understanding about how markets and the economy work, not just in theory but also in the real world. And she calls it like she sees it.â Easy money The US central bank has held interest rates near zero since late 2008. It has also roughly quadrupled its balance sheet to about $3.7 trillion through three rounds of massive bond purchases to press down longer-term borrowing costs. âYellenâs nomination is a clear signal that the highly accommodative monetary policy stance will likely remain in place,â wrote Barclays economist Michael Gapen in New York. While analysts said Ms Yellenâs policy approach should be supportive for stock markets that have come to rely on easy money from the Fed, the market reaction yesterday did not provide a clear read on investor sentiment. Stocks closed modestly higher, lifted in part by rising hopes that Congress could break a political impasse that has led to a partial government shutdown and now threatens a possible default. The US Treasury has warned it could run out of cash quickly to pay the nationâs bills if lawmakers do not raise the governmentâs $16.7 trillion debt ceiling soon. The Fed is currently buying bonds at a monthly pace of $85 billion. It surprised investors in September when it delayed an anticipated reduction in its purchases. Economists, watching tepid signals on growth and hiring, wonder if a decision to scale back might be delayed until Yellen is in charge next year, but minutes of the Fedâs September meeting released yesterday showed policymakers were close to acting. Mr Obama settled on Ms Yellen after his former economic adviser Lawrence Summers withdrew from consideration in the face of fierce opposition within the presidentâs own Democratic Party that raised questions about his chances of congressional confirmation. Mr Summers would have been expected to pull back the Fedâs support for the economy more quickly. With markets jittery about a potential US default, Mr Obama appeared to want to provide reassurance with his words about Ms Yellen. He noted her ability to reach consensus with colleagues - something Mr Summersâ opponents say he lacked - and her success at predicting the risks of a major recession before it happened. âGiven the urgent economic challenges facing our nation, I urge the Senate to confirm Janet without delay,â Mr Obama said. âI am absolutely confident that she will be an exceptional chair of the Federal Reserve.â Online News .

Public Accounts Committee likely to quiz hospital boards about payments Public Accounts Committee likely to quiz hospital boards about payments Department of Health files said the master of the National Maternity Hospital received a âprivately- funded allowanceâ of â¬45,000. Photograph: Bryan OâBrien Two weeks into the controversy over top-up payments, much has been learned about the unconventional remuneration arrangements some voluntary hospitals and agencies have in place for their executives. However, many more questions remain to be answered. What we do know is that in 2011 more than â¬3.2 million was paid out in additional allowances from State funds to senior managers. Some of these were completely above board, while others, such as the provision of health insurance cover, motor allowances and payments for serving as secretary to companies or boards, fell outside those sanctioned officially in the public service. In addition, 13 State-funded voluntary hospitals and health agencies were collectively paying more than â¬900,000 in additional remuneration and benefits to executives from funds drawn from unknown private sources. The remaining questions include: What was the motivation behind these payments? Who authorised the payments? Who knew about them? And, effectively, what is now to be done about them? Another key issue is where all the private money to pay these allowances came from. The controversy itself was initially a slow burner. The Online News reported the findings of the HSE internal audit which uncovered these payments as far back as September 27th. However, the story really took off after this newspaper reported that the source of the â¬30,000 top-up allowance being paid to the chief executive of Our Ladyâs Hospital in Crumlin was profits from shops on the campus. Department of Health files subsequently gave breakdowns of who in senior management across the voluntary hospital/ agency sector was receiving the additional payments. The department files said that the master of the National Maternity Hospital , Dr Rhona Mahony , received a âprivately- funded allowanceâ of â¬45,000. Other privately funded payments went to the secretary manager, the director of nursing and the financial controller at the hospital. In the Rotunda Hospital , the files maintained that its master, Dr Sam Coulter Smith , received an on-call allowance of nearly â¬50,000 and a separate privately funded allowance of â¬20,000 on top of his State salary. Privately funded allowances were also paid to the secretary/general manager, the financial controller and the human resources manager. While the Rotunda Hospital has said nothing publicly, the National Maternity Hospital last week maintained it remunerated its personnel âin accordance with their employment terms, with the agreement of the appropriate board sub-committees, and in full compliance with public service pay requirementsâ. Dr Mahony said the â¬45,000 paid to her represented professional fees from private patients. However, the HSE, in its evidence to the DÃ¡il Public Accounts Committee , appeared to cast doubt on both these statements. The HSE listed the National Maternity Hospital among a group of 12 organisations which it said had acknowledged in writing that they were not in compliance with Government pay policy. Secondly, the HSE insisted that it was the National Maternity Hospital itself which had described the additional payments made to Dr Mahony and others as âprivately funded allowancesâ. The Public Accounts Committee is planning to ask the boards of hospitals not in compliance with Government pay policy to explain the context of the top-up payments. The Government has now said that top-ups are wrong and must end. However, as The Online News reported last week, only two years ago senior Ministers agreed to offer a salary rate of â¬195,000 to Bill Maher, a senior official at St Vincentâs Hospital, to take up a post in the HSE. At the time the official salary for the chief executive at St Vincentâs was just over â¬145,000. Return to results
Questions remain for US senators over tax law Questions remain for US senators over tax law Senators Carl Levin and John McCain had criticised Ireland over Apple tax rate Senator John McCain. In a joint statement with senator Carl Levin, he said: âIrelandâs promise to reform its tax rules to stop multinationals from using Irish subsidiaries to escape or defer paying taxes anywhere in the world is encouraging.â Simon Carswell, Colm Keena Two US senators who criticised Irelandâs laws for allowing American multinationals avoid tax have said important questions remain about how the Government plans to close a loophole. Democrat Carl Levin and Republican John McCain said they hoped a pledge by Minister for Finance Michael Noonan to tackle the use of âstatelessâ Irish companies by US multinationals to lower their taxes would show that Ireland is âready to close the door on these egregious corporate tax abusesâ. The Government announced plans in Tuesdayâs budget to introduce a change that will mean Irish-registered companies must be tax resident in some jurisdiction. Encouraging promise Apple was criticised by the two senators at a Congressional hearing in May for using Irish companies, which were not tax resident anywhere, to pay less than 2 per cent tax on $44 billion of non-US income over four years. âIrelandâs promise to reform its tax rules to stop multinationals from using Irish subsidiaries to escape or defer paying taxes anywhere in the world is encouraging,â the senators said in a joint statement. âImportant questions do remain, however, including whether the new rules will continue to allow Irish subsidiaries to dodge taxes by, for example, excluding substantial income from the 12 per cent Irish tax rate, calculating taxable income in ways that produce a lower effective tax rate, or simply declaring tax residency with no corporate tax.â During his budget speech Mr Noonan said it was important that Ireland protected its reputation. âIreland wants to be part of the solution to this global tax challenge, not part of the problem,â he said. Correct approach Yesterday he said he believed a low corporate tax regime, based on statutes which Ireland has always had, was the correct approach for Ireland. âBut we recognise that there has been aggressive tax planning which plays one tax regime off against another. That is something that through the OECD and the EU there are moves now to deal with. Most of the closing of that [the loopholes] will have to be through international co-operation.â The American Chamber of Commerce Ireland said the changes should not affect Irelandâs competitiveness for foreign direct investment. The chamberâs chairwoman, Anna Scally , said the release of a document outlining Irelandâs international tax strategy would be âwelcomed by potential and current investorsâ. Return to results
Rate of employment growth accelerates in third quarter Rate of employment growth accelerates in third quarter Unemployment fell by 12.8% or 41,700 in the year since the third quarter of last year Minister for Social Protection Joan Burton said there were still far too many people out of work, and that tackling unemployment remained the Governmentâs number one priority, but said the figures demonstrated steady progress. The rate of employment growth accelerated during the third quarter of 2013, according to the latest figures from the Central Statistics Office . There was a year-on-year increase in employment of 3.2 per cent, or 58,000, for the third quarter of this year as compared with the same quarter last year, according to the Quarterly National Household Survey results. Total employment rose to 1,899,300. The 3.2 per cent year-on-year rise compares with an increase of 1.8 per cent for the previous quarter, 1.1 per cent for the first quarter and 0.1 per cent for the last quarter of 2012. A comparable rate of increase in employment was last seen at the end of 2007, Brian Ring of the CSO told a media briefing yesterday. The household survey figures are the official or definitive labour force estimates for the Irish economy. Unemployment fell by 12.8 per cent, or 41,700 in the year since the third quarter of 2012, reducing the total number of people out of work to 282,900. The comparable percentage fall for the second quarter was 6.9 per cent. The preceding quarter recorded an even higher year-on-year rate of decline, of 9.3 per cent, but the two quarters prior to that recorded falls of 6.1 per cent and 1.1 per cent, making for a general trend towards accelerating fall-off in unemployment. Long-term jobless The numbers in long-term unemployment fell at a faster rate than did the numbers of unemployed overall, while the rise in full-time employment was greater than the rise in part-time employment. Minister for Social Protection Joan Burton said there were still far too many people out of work, and that tackling unemployment remained the Governmentâs number one priority, but said the figures demonstrated steady progress. âEspecially important is the fact that the majority of people returning to work are returning to full-time employment,â she said. David McNamara of Davy said the data provides further hard evidence the Irish economy bounced back in the second half of this year. He said he expected the strong rise in employment to drive consumer spending in the second half of this year and into 2014, causing Davy to leave its above-consensus forecasts for gross domestic product growth unchanged at 1 per cent in 2013 and 2.5 per cent in 2014. âIf anything, our current unemployment forecasts of 13.7 per cent in 2013 and 12.8 per cent in 2014 now look too pessimistic, so we would expect to revise down those estimates . . .â SME criticism Similar positive responses were issued by other observers, though Isme chief executive Mark Fielding said the increase is âneedlessly slowâ and if the Government would only listen to the owners of small and medium-sized enterprises, more jobs would be created.

Reilly requests âurgent actionâ to ensure agencies compliant with Government pay policy Reilly requests âurgent actionâ to ensure agencies compliant with Government pay policy Former chair of the Central Remedial Clinic, Des Peelo, has claimed that two of the âvery top peopleâ in the HSE attended a meeting in 2009 at which so-called top-ups being paid to senior staff were agreed to. Photograph: Bryan OâBrien The HSE has said that top-up payments for the chief executive and other senior staff in the Central Remedial Clinic (CRC) were ânot at any stage agreed to or sanctionedâ. The statement comes after a former chair of the CRC, Des Peelo claimed earlier today that two of the âvery top peopleâ in the HSE attended a meeting in 2009 at which privately-funded top-up payments for nine people in the organisation were agreed to. In an interview on RTÃ Radio 1 this morning, Mr Peelo said that, in a meeting held in June 2009, the HSE had agreed to fund the salaries up to the end of the year after which point the difference over and above the HSE-funded portion of the salaries would be funded privately. He said the HSE was âfully awareâ of this arrangement and that âevery year since 2010 the HSE get a list of salaries and they know about it...itâs been fully on the record and agreed with the HSEâ. Minister for Health James Reilly today met the director general of the HSE Tony OâBrien to seek an update on unsanctioned payments to management at organisations receiving funding under Section 38 of the 2004 Health Act. The Department of Health said Dr Reilly requested âurgent action to ensure that every agency is fully compliant with Government pay policyâ. âThe HSE will take whatever actions are necessary to deliver full compliance and ensure that any governance deficits identified are comprehensively rectified immediately. Meetings are now being arranged with each agency concerned,â the department said. âArising from this process, those found not to be compliant will be called in by the Director General to meet him before Christmas. Such meetings will commence next week.â A statement from the Central Remedial Clinic, released this evening, said that, in 2009, it had agreed with the HSE to phase out any existing management salaries being paid over and above the Department of Healthâs consolidated pay scales but that âin the meantime, the difference between the Department of Health pay scales and the contractually obligated salaries of these staff would be funded by the Central Remedial Clinic through the lottery proceeds received by the Friends of the CRCâ. âThis has been the case since then with regular reports being sent to the HSE confirming the portion of salaries being paid through both sources.â the statement said. However, the HSE this evening in a statement said: âThe arrangement entered into by CRC with its former chief executive and other senior staff at the organisation was not at any stage agreed to or sanctioned by the HSE. All HSE funded agencies are expected to comply with public pay policyâ. Return to results
Repsol and Argentina in preliminary agreement on compensation for subsidiary takeover Repsol and Argentina in preliminary agreement on compensation for subsidiary takeover The price of shares of Spanish oil giant Repsol at Madridâs stock exchange yesterday as shares rose more than 3 per cent after a preliminary agreement reached by the Argentinian government and Repsol on the compensation for the expropriation of 51 per cent of YPFâs shares. Photograph: JJ Guillen/Argentina News of a preliminary agreement between Repsol and the Argentine government on compensation for last yearâs expropriation of a subsidiary of the energy firm drove gains on the Spanish stock market today. The administration of Cristina FernÃ¡ndez took control of 51 per cent of Repsol subsidiary YPF in April 2012, claiming the Spanish firm had failed to invest enough in its operations. Repsol contested the move, leading to a series of legal wrangles and souring relations between Madrid and Buenos Aires. Nineteen months on, the two sides appear to have found a solution, with the Argentine government putting a compensation offer on the table on Monday. Neither Repsol nor the Argentine government would give details, but Spanish media have reported that Buenos Aires is prepared to pay â¬3.7 billion, at least some of which would be in sovereign debt. The same reports say the deal would also see Repsol drop all legal action against Argentina , including a complaint before the World Bank. Repsol had been demanding compensation worth â¬7 billion. A brief statement said it would âanalyse and agree on what it deems best for the exclusive interests of the company and its shareholdersâ in a board meeting today. Major gains on Spainâs Ibex index yesterday (left) showed the market anticipating a positive response to the offer. Repsol closed up 4.3 per cent and was among the dayâs biggest gainers, along with Sacyr Vallehermoso and Caixabank, both of which hold stakes in the firm. The government of Mariano Rajoy has closely followed the case, due to Repsolâs size and global significance. Spanish industry minister JosÃ© Manuel Soria was involved in the negotiations with the Argentine government that led to Mondayâs pre-accord, along with representatives of Repsol, Caixabank, Sacyr and Pemex.

Reyes tricked into Real admission Reyes tricked into Real admission Jose Antonio Reyes has added to speculation linking him with a move from Arsenal to Real Madrid after falling victim to a radio prank. The Spaniard believed he was talking to Real Madrid sporting director Emilio Butragueno when he allegedly berated his team-mates as "bad people". "I wish I was playing for Real Madrid," the 21-year-old told Cadena Cope. "Hopefully it could happen. I love the way Madrid play. I'm not happy with the way things are." The striker joined the Gunners from Seville for Â£17m at the start of 2004, but it has frequently been reported that he is homesick. He began the season in superb form but has struggled to maintain his high standards as Arsenal have gradually lost the Premiership initiative to Manchester United and Chelsea. "If I'm not (playing for Real) I'm going to have to carry on playing with some bad people," he added. "I'm sure there are none in the Real dressing room. "I'm happy Madrid is interested in me because it has always been my dream since I was little to play there." Before the story surfaced, Reyes had moved to play down reports linking him with the Spanish giants, issuing a statement through Arsenal describing the speculation as "flattering". "I have seen the stories in the media linking me with Real Madrid," he had said on Thursday lunchtime. "But not only am I under contract at Arsenal, I am happy here and committed to helping the team win more trophies." Butragueno, meanwhile, was angry at being impersonated by the radio disc jockey. "It is a disgrace, there is no foundation to this," he said. "He is an Arsenal player and we have to be respectful. We have to be careful because of the rumours that appear in the news."

Rush future at Chester uncertain Rush future at Chester uncertain Ian Rush's future as Chester manager is uncertain after he and assistant Mark Aizlewood refused a severance package. Chester have won only two of their last 10 League games but Chairman Steve Vaughan claims he cannot afford to sack the 43-year-old Liverpool legend. Vaughan said: "I offered a financial settlement so they could resign with dignity but an obvious action is to dismiss them. "I haven't because of the finances, so technically they're still employees." Vaughan claimed that Aizlewood had "verbally agreed" to the offer. But the Chester chairman added: "After they discussed the offer with their solicitor, who also acts as their agent, they decided to withdraw the verbal agreement, which was disappointing." Rush was appointed at the end of August following the departure of former Liverpool team-mate Mark Wright, who guided Chester to the Conference title last season. Chester were bottom of League Two when Rush took over but the former Liverpool striker enjoyed an impressive start to managerial life, taking the club into the third round of the FA cup and winning the manager-of-the-month award for October. Chester's downturn in form culminated in a 5-0 defeat at Shrewsbury that leaves them hovering just above the League Two relegation zone. Comments are closed for this article.
SMEs employ seven in 10 workers in the Republic SMEs employ seven in 10 workers in the Republic CSOâs Business in Ireland study shows 99.8% of enterprises employ less than 250 people The distribution sector, including retail and wholesale activities, accounted for 22.7 per cent of all businesses and 26.7 per cent of all engaged workers in 2011. Photograph: Michaela Rehle/Online News Small and medium enterprises employed almost seven in every ten people engaged in the workforce in the Republic in 2011 but generated just over half of turnover, analysis by the Central Statistics Office shows. The Business in Ireland 2011 study published today shows SMEs account for 99.8 per cent of all active businesses in the Republic, but generate just 46 per cent of gross value added (GVA), a key indicator of business productivity. The headline figures are broadly similar to the previous year. In 2011 there were 189,000 active businesses in operation, engaging over 1.2 million workers. Just over nine in ten businesses were micro-enterprises with less than 10 employees. Large enterprises accounted for just 0.2 per cent of all businesses but employed 31.4 per cent of all engaged workers. The services sector was the largest in terms of numbers of businesses and employees, accounting for 47.6 per cent of active enterprises and 42.1 per cent of workers. This included a wide range of services such as transport, accommodation and food, publishing, telecommunications, legal and accounting activities and scientific research. This was followed by the distribution sector, including retail and wholesale activities, with 22.7 per cent of all businesses and 26.7 per cent of all engaged workers. Construction accounted for 19.4 per cent of all enterprises but just 7 per cent of engaged workers. Industry had the largest turnover of any sector, claiming 29.8 per cent of the â¬376 .7 billion total turnover in the business economy in the year, despite accounting for just 7.3 per cent of all enterprises and 16.6 per cent of all engaged workers. The distribution sector also claimed a significant proportion of total turnover at 27.3 per cent, while the services sector claimed just 27 per cent. Financial and insurance activities accounted for 13.4 per cent while construction claimed just 2.5 per cent. The CSO analysis shows the extent of the impact the downturn has had on SMEs, with employment falling 19.7 per cent from 1.045 million in 2006 to 839,000 in 2011. The construction sector was hardest hit, with 128,000 job losses in the period, a fall of 61.1 per cent. Industry was also affected significantly, with SME employment in the sector falling by 22.8 per cent or 31,000 people between 2006 and 2011. The only sector which showed a marginal increase in employment was finance and insurance. In contrast to the SMEs, there was a recovery in the numbers employed by large enterprises in 2011, rising by 1,000 to 384,000, driven mostly by the industry and services sectors. Irish businesses generated â¬100.6 billion GVA in the year, with industry and services accounting for 36.7 per cent and 33.6 per cent respectively. Turnover per person engaged averaged â¬278,000 across all sectors, with industry recording the highest figure at over â¬594,000 while construction recorded the lowest at â¬103,000. GVA per person engaged averaged â¬76,000 across all sectors, with industry bringing in the highest figure at almost â¬196,000 and construction the lowest at â¬37,000. Industry was the most profitable sector with an operating surplus of 24.5 per cent of turnover. Services, construction and financial and insurance activities recorded similar profitability levels at around 15 per cent. Distribution was the least profitable with an operating surplus of 5.9 per cent. A more detailed breakdown shows real estate was the most profitable sector with an operating surplus of 37.1 per cent. This was followed by electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply with 31.6 per cent, and manufacturing at 24.2 per cent. The motor trade sector recorded the lowest operating surplus at 2.8 per cent, while wholesale, retail and accommodation and food services recorded between 5 and 7 per cent. Irish multinationals employed over 246,000 people in foreign affiliates in 2011, primarily in the UK and US, generating a turnover of almost â¬73 billion. By contrast, foreign multinationals employed over 250,000 in Ireland, generating a turnover of â¬176 billion. A new section in the report concentrated on business costs, revealing that Irish enterprises spent a total of â¬38 billion on personnel costs in 2011, including wages and salaries for employees, and employersâ social security. Some â¬33.5 billion was paid in wages and salaries, with the average wage just over â¬32,900. Wages in SMEs averaged â¬29,800, significantly lower than the average â¬39400 in large enterprises. .

SPD finance ministers used letter-box companies for pension fund securitisation SPD finance ministers used letter-box companies for pension fund securitisation Peer Steinbrueck: both he and his Social Democratic Party have been particularly vocal critics of Irelandâs tax laws. Photograph: Johannes Eisele/AFP/Getty Images German politician Peer SteinbrÃ¼ck â one of the fiercest critics of Irelandâs tax regime â used Irish letter box companies when finance minister to try to balance the German budget through financial engineering. Mr SteinbrÃ¼ck â an unsuccessful candidate in the recent German election â and his Social Democratic Party (SPD) have been particularly vocal critics of Irelandâs tax laws. He used the recent election campaign to attack failed finance market alchemy and condemn âtax oasesâ such as Ireland and the Netherlands. According to this morningâs Der Spiegel magazine, Berlin began doing business in Ireland to tap into pension funds of Germanyâs post office, which was privatised and broken up in 1995 into three companies for telecoms, post and post office bank. Pension obligations At the time of the privatisation, the German federal government agreed to shoulder the companiesâ existing looming pension obligations while the three newly privatised companies were obliged to pay some â¬20 billion until 2042. This deal was forgotten for a decade until 2005, when Mr SteinbrÃ¼ckâs predecessor as finance minister, SPD man Hans Eichel , struggled to reduce Germanyâs deficit below the prescribed EU ceiling of 3 per cent of gross domestic product. Investment bankers hired by Berlin identified the future income to the pension fund from the privatised companies as an asset and recommended selling it off â a process known as securitisation â through an Irish letter box firm. Pensions contribution The company was set up, the asset sold and Berlin used some â¬8 billion earned to replace its own pensions contribution from 2005 to 2007. Its hope of reducing its outgoings â and deficit â fell foul of the European Commission . Brussels ruled the deal had moved, but not reduced, Berlinâs own liabilities to the postal pension fund. Germanyâs federal court of auditors was similarly critical, accusing Berlin of creative accounting to âpush liabilities into the futureâ. The juggling failed to reduce Berlinâs deficit, though the advising investment bankers still earned â¬83 million on the deal. Further Irish companies Despite this, Mr Eichelâs successor, Mr SteinbrÃ¼ck, continued the practice â covering the stateâs pension liabilities with securitised pension obligations. To save taxes on the transactions, Berlin set up further companies in Ireland, named German Postal Pensions Securitisation 1 and 2. With the securitisation income now paid up-front, Berlin now has to shoulder â alone â the remaining cost of 275,000 pensioners. Worse, the pension fund members were told that some â¬2.8 billion in income from the Irish-based companies was invested in special-purpose vehicles including those of Dexia , the failed Belgian-French bank nationalised in 2011 with â¬90 billion of public money. The SPDâs use of Irish firms to juggle pensions payments and save taxes could be an interesting point of discussion when TÃ¡naiste Eamon Gilmore visits Berlin this week. On Mr Gilmoreâs last visit to Berlin, in October last year, Mr SteinbrÃ¼ck used a public discussion forum to criticise Irelandâs tax rate. âIf Germany is making available its creditworthiness to others, we expect others to improve their own revenue base,â said Mr SteinbrÃ¼ck.

Slowing of purchases in December feasible Slowing of purchases in December feasible The rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee made no changes to policy at its October meeting, keeping its asset purchases steady at $85 billion a month, but the statement implied it did not see a lot of damage from the government shutdown earlier this month The US Federal Reserve yesterday said the worldâs largest economy was still expanding at a moderate pace, suggesting a slowing of asset purchases in December or January was still a possibility. The rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee made no changes to policy at its October meeting, keeping its asset purchases steady at $85 billion a month, but the statement implied it did not see a lot of damage from the government shutdown earlier this month. Although markets have assumed the Fed will not âtaperâ its asset purchases until March, the statement implied it could still slow the programme earlier than that â perhaps as early as its December meeting â if the economic data justified it. The Fed surprised markets in September by choosing to keep purchases on hold. That prompted a global rally in risky assets and big fall in market interest rates, which had risen after Fed communications in June and July suggested it was close to a taper. Scrambled data Combined with the effects of the shutdown â which has scrambled the data for October â markets have assumed the September decision meant the Fed was automatically on hold for some months. But Octoberâs statement suggests that is not necessarily correct. In the most notable change in the statement, the Fed eliminated a sentence from September saying that tighter financial conditions â Fed code for higher market interest rates â could lead to a slower improvement in the economy. Scrapping the sentence suggests it is now comfortable with interest rates. It also kept Septemberâs language that the economy was expanding at a âmoderateâ pace, choosing not to downgrade it to âmodestâ, although it noted the housing sector had slowed somewhat in recent months. However, the Fed pointedly said that its judgment was based on âavailable dataâ, indicating that it could yet change as more detailed information for October becomes available. The Fed board voted for the decision by a majority of 9-1. Esther George , the president of the Kansas City Fed, dissented because she was concerned about the risk of future economic and financial imbalances. â Comments are closed for this article.
Solutions to net security fears Solutions to net security fears Fake bank e-mails, or phishing, and stories about ID theft are damaging the potential of using the net for online commerce, say e-business experts. Trust in online security is falling as a result. Almost 70% of those asked in a poll said that net firms are not doing enough to protect people. The survey of more than 1,000 people reported that 43% were not willing to hand over personal information online. It is worrying for shopaholics and firms who want to exploit the net. More people are becoming aware of online security issues but they have little confidence that companies are doing enough to counter the threats, said security firm RSA, which carried out the poll. An estimated 12 million Britons now use the net as a way of managing their financial affairs. Security experts say that scare stories and the vulnerabilities dogging e-commerce and e-banking are being taken seriously - by banks in particular. "I don't think the threat is overplayed," Barry Beal, global security manager for Capgemini, told the Online News News website. He added: "The challenge for banks is to provide the customer with something that improves security but balances that with usability." Ensuring extra security measures are in place protects them too, as well as the individual, and it is up to both parties to make sure they do what is necessary to prevent fraud, he said. "Card issuers will keep us informed of types of attacks and what procedure to take to protect ourselves. If we do that, they will indemnify us," he said. Many believe using login details like usernames and passwords are simply not good enough anymore though. One of the biggest challenges to improving security online is how to authenticate an individual's identity. Several security companies have developed methods which complement or replace passwords, which are easily compromised and easy to forget. Last year, a street survey found that more than 70% of people would reveal their password for a bar of chocolate. On average, people have to remember four different passwords. Some resort to using the same one for all their online accounts. Those who use several passwords often write them down and hide them in a desk or in a document on their computer. In a separate survey by RSA, 80% said they were fed up with passwords and would like a better way to login to work computer systems. For many, the ideal is a single online identity that can be validated once with a series of passwords and questions, or some biometric measurement like a fingerprint or iris scan with a token like a smartcard. Activcard is just one of the many companies, like RSA Security, which has been trying to come up with just that. RSA has a deal with internet provider AOL that lets people pay monthly for a one-time passcode generation service. Users get a physical token which automatically generates a code which stays active for 60 seconds. Many companies use a token-based method already for employees to access networks securely already. Activcard's method is more complex. It is currently trailing its one-time passcode generation technology with UK banks. Steve Ash, from Activcard, told the Online News News website there are two parts to the process of identification. The most difficult is to ascertain whether an individual is who they say they are when they are online. "The end solution is to provide a method where you combine something the user knows with something they have and present those both." The method it has developed makes use of the chip embedded in bank cards and a special card reader which can generate unique codes that are active for a specified amount of time. This can be adjusted at any time and can be active for as little as 30 seconds before it changes. It combines that with usual usernames and passwords, as well as other security questions. "You take the card, put it in the reader, enter your pin number, and a code is given. "If you wanted then to transfer funds, for instance, you would have to have the code to authorise the transaction." The clever bit happens back at the bank's secure servers. The code is validated by the bank's systems, matching the information they expect with the customer's unique key. "Each individual gets a key which is unique to them. It is a 2048-bit long number that is virtually impossible to crack," said Mr Ash. It means that in a typical security attack, explains Mr Ash, even if password information is captured by a scammer using keystroke software or just through spoof websites, they need the passcode. "By the time they go back [to use the information], the code has expired, so they can't prove who they are," according to Mr Ash. In the next few years, Mr Ash predicts that this kind of method will be commonplace before we see biometric authentication that is acceptable for widespread use. "PCs will have readers built into them, the cost of readers will be very cheap, and more people will have the cards." The gadgets we carry around, like personal digital assistants (PDAs) and mobiles, could also have integrated card reader technology in them. "The PDA or phone method is a possible alternative as people are always carrying phones around," he said. Comments are closed for this article.
Sony wares win innovation award Sony wares win innovation award Sony has taken the prize for top innovator at the annual awards of PC Pro Magazine. It won the award for taking risks with products and for its "brave" commitment to good design. Conferring the award, PC Pro's staff picked out Sony's PCG-X505/P Vaio laptop as a "stunning piece of engineering". The electronics giant beat off strong competition from Toshiba and chip makers AMD and Intel to take the gong. Paul Trotter, news and features editor of PC Pro, said several Sony products helped it to take the innovation award. He said Sony's Clie PEG UX50 media player with its swivel screen and qwerty keyboard "broke the design rules yet again". Other Sony products that helped included the Vaio W1 desktop computer and the RA-104 media server. Mr Trotter said Sony's combining of computer, screen and keyboard in the W1 was likely to be widely copied in future home PCs. The company has also become one of the first to use organic LEDs in its products. "While not always inventing new technology itself, Sony was never afraid to innovate around various formats," said Mr Trotter. Other awards decided by PC Pro's staff and contributors included one for Canon's EOS 300D digital camera in the Most Wanted Hardware category. Microsoft's Media Player 10 took the award for Most Wanted Software. This year was the 10th anniversary of the PC Pro awards, which splits its prizes into two sections. The first are chosen by the magazine's writers and consultants, the second are voted for by readers. Mr Trotter said more than 13,000 people voted for the Reliability and Service Awards, twice as many as in 2003.

Souness backs Smith for Scotland Souness backs Smith for Scotland Graeme Souness believes Walter Smith would be the perfect choice to succeed Berti Vogts as Scotland manager. Souness's former assistant at Rangers is hot favourite to take over from Vogts, who resigned on Monday. "Walter is most definitely the ideal candidate for that job. He'd be perfect for it," Souness told Online News Sport. The Scottish Football Association has appointed Tommy Burns as provisional caretaker-boss for the friendly against Sweden on 17 November. "He fits the bill because of his knowledge and understanding of the Scotland team and football. He is experienced and has been successful." Souness added: "Walter is a real football person, as I know from working with him at Ibrox. "On top of all that he is a proper human being who would command the instant respect of the players and everyone involved in Scottish football." Souness joined Sir Alex Ferguson in backing Smith's claims. The Scottish Football Association is about to embark on the search for Vogts successor after appointing Tommy Burns in a caretaker capacity. Ferguson said: "He (Smith) would be the outstanding candidate as far as I'm concerned. "You need somebody who knows what they're doing and Walter would bring a wealth of experience to the job." The Man Utd boss continued: "I don't know what credentials are needed to do the job but it's a job that needs a lot of experience. "He was my assistant with Scotland and here at Manchester United and he has also managed Glasgow Rangers. "He would need to change the whole shape of Scottish football and radical changes are needed." Smith was assistant to Ferguson at the World Cup in Mexico in 1986. The former Everton and Rangers boss has been out of the game since a spell as Manchester United assistant last term. Online News Sport understands that Smith would be willing to discuss taking over if he was approached by the Scottish FA. If he is tempted to take over, it seems almost certain Smith's long-time right-hand man Archie Knox would also play a part in the national team set-up. Smith already has the backing of many pundits and fans, including former Scotland manager Craig Brown. Brown said: "Walter is an outstanding candidate without doubt. "He would be admirable choice. I spoke to him on Sunday and I got the impression he would take it. He was asking me about it and I was positive." Other candidates for the job include former Scotland midfielders Gordon Strachan and Gary McAllister and Vogts' assistant Tommy Burns. Comments are closed for this article.
Souped-up wi-fi is on the horizon Souped-up wi-fi is on the horizon Super high-speed wireless data networks could soon be in use in the UK. The government's wireless watchdog is seeking help on the best way to regulate the technology behind such networks called Ultra Wideband (UWB). Ofcom wants to ensure that the arrival of UWB-using devices does not cause problems for those that already use the same part of the radio spectrum. UWB makes it possible to stream huge amounts of data through the air over short distances. One of the more likely uses of UWB is to make it possible to send DVD quality video images wirelessly to TV screens or to let people beam music to media players around their home. The technology has the potential to transmit hundreds of megabits of data per second. UWB could also be used to create so-called Personal Area Networks that let a person's gadgets quickly and easily swap data amongst themselves. The technology works over a range up to 10 metres and uses billions of short radio pulses every second to carry data. At the recent Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas products with UWB chips built-in got their first public airing. Currently, use of UWB is only allowed in the UK under a strict licencing scheme. "We're seeking opinion from industry to find out whether or not we should allow UWB on a licence-exempt basis," said a spokesman for Ofcom. Companies have until 24 March to respond. In April the EC is due to start its own consultation on Europe-wide adoption of UWB. The cross-Europe body for radio regulators, known as the European Conference of Postal and Telecommunications Administrations (CEPT), is carrying out research for this harmonisation programme. Early sight of the CEPT work has caused controversy as some think it over-emphasises UWB's potential to interfere with existing users. By contrast a preliminary Ofcom report found that it would be quite straight-forward to deploy UWB without causing problems for those that already use it. The Ofcom spokesman said it was considering imposing a "mask" or set of technical restrictions on UWB-using devices. "We would want these devices to have very strict controls on power levels so they can not transmit a long way or over a wide area," he said. Despite the current restrictions the technology is already being used. Cambridge-based Ubisense has about 40 customers around the world using the short-range radio technology, said David Theriault, standards and regulatory liaison for Ubisense. He said that UWB was driving novel ways to interact with computers. "It's like having a 3D mouse all the time," he said. He said that European decisions on what to do with UWB allied with IEEE decisions on the exact specifications for it would help drive adoption. Prior to its adoption as a way for gadgets and computers to communicate, UWB was used as a sensing technology. It is used to spot such things as cracks under the surface of runways or to help firemen detect people through walls.
Strong new orders drove the fastest expansion in Chinaâs manufacturing sector in seven months in Oct... Strong new orders drove the fastest expansion in Chinaâs manufacturing sector in seven months in October, a preliminary survey showed today, more evidence that the economy is stabilising although a strong rebound remains elusive. The flash PMI figure, the earliest reading of Chinaâs monthly economic performance, offers some positive news after disappointing export figures and Septemberâs manufacturing PMI, which had shown weak domestic demand. The Markit/HSBC Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) stood at 50.9 in October, above Septemberâs final reading of 50.2 and marking a seven-month high. Ten of 11 sub-indices rose. âChinaâs growth recovery is becoming consolidated into the fourth quarter following the bottoming out in the third quarterâ said Qu Hongbin an HSBC economist in a statement. âThis momentum is likely to continue in the coming months, creating favourable conditions for speeding up structural reforms.â New orders rose to 51.6, the highest in seven months and well above the 50 line separating expansion from contraction. âFrom what we can see companies have drawn down inventories now, so once you get a little bit of demand you get orders coming in,â said Stephen Green, an economist with Standard Chartered bank. The strong reading lifted Chinese stocks off two-week lows, although investors are jittery about possible policy tightening by the central bank to put a cap on rising inflation and housing prices. Those fears have seen short-term money rates surge this week. In the first nine months of the year, the $8.5 trillion economy grew 7.7 per cent from a year earlier, putting it on track to achieve Beijingâs 2013 target of 7.5 per cent, which would be the weakest growth in 23 years. Still, many economists see growth slowing ahead as global demand remains soft and as Beijing restructures the economy towards one driven more by consumer demand than investment and credit. âDespite the rise of this flash PMI reading, we believe sequential GDP growth peaked in the third quarter at 2.2 per cent and people should expect moderation to a more sustainable growth rate of 1.8-2.0 per cent in the fourth quarter,â said Ting Lu and economist with Bank of America-Merrill Lynch. The government has repeatedly stated it will accept slower growth during the restructuring, but policymakers have also shown a willingness to step in to keep growth stable. The flash PMI showed new export orders ticked up only marginally, suggesting a stabilisation in global demand but no solid rebound. Exports unexpectedly fell 0.3 per cent in September, as fears of a tapering in US monetary stimulus weighed on demand from Southeast Asia. Exports were a drag on the economy in the first three quarters, subtracting 1.7 percentage points from growth Policymakers stated they would support the trade sector if it looked like missing an 8 per cent growth target for this year. Bank of Americaâs Lu urged caution on attaching too much significance to the flash PMI figures. âWe should keep in mind that the HSBC flash PMI is quite volatile and the final reading could vary significantly from the flash,â said Lu. âThe HSBC PMI has a quite small sample size with undisclosed number of missing values.â Last monthâs final PMI figures delivered a shock to the markets, coming in a full point below the flash reading for September. The flash PMI is based on 85-90 per cent of total responses for each month. (Online News) Comments are closed for this article.
TD hits out at removal of medical cards TD hits out at removal of medical cards Tom Fleming, the Kerry South Independent TD, said, âIt is very hard to comprehend how a modern civilised society can look at accounts rather than at individual people. There seems to be no discretion.â Photograph: Don MacMonagle Anne Lucey An Independent TD said yesterday it was âvery hard to comprehend the insensitivityâ with which ill people were being dealt with by the removal of their medical cards Yesterday, the HSE informed a 66-year-old woman from Dingle , Co Kerry, who suffers from breast cancer, that her appeal against the removal of her medical card was unsuccessful. Income threshold Her 69-year-old husband, who is also ill and awaiting an operation, does not have a medical card either. Both are dependant on the old age pension, have no private medical insurance and are â¬30 over the annual income threshold. The coupleâs GP visit card has also been removed. The woman said she has been fighting the removal of their entitlements since last May and is suffering from depression brought on by the threats to remove their entitlement. She said that while she may be able to afford the â¬120 a month for her cancer medication, she does not have the money for any further medical procedures associated with her condition. âIf I didnât have the cancer, I think I could cope. But we have no other income, and no private insurance,â she said yesterday. Tom Fleming , the Kerry South Independent TD who has been trying to fight the coupleâs case, said yesterday: âShe has recurring cancer. Her husband is nearly 70. Sheâs a typical example of what I and other TDs are dealing with since the â¬20 million cut to the medical card budget. âVery insensitiveâ âIt is all very insensitive. I have seen the upset, the stress and the whole worry that is descending on vulnerable people. âIt is very hard to comprehend how a modern civilised society can look at accounts rather than at individual people.

Testing times for Australiaâs âopen for businessâ mantra Testing times for Australiaâs âopen for businessâ mantra With the mining boom coming to an end and growth slowing in China, prime minister Tony Abbott faces his biggest test An employee walks past a stacker as it loads crushed iron ore at a processing facility in the Solomon mining hub in Western Australia. The mining industry, along with mining-related activities, accounts for almost 20 per cent of Australian GDP, and 10 per cent of employment. Photograph: Sergio Dionisio/Online News When Tony Abbott swept to power last month, he declared in his victory speech that Australia âis under new management and . . . once more open for businessâ. The management â Abbottâs conservative Liberal-National coalition â may be new, but the challenges facing Australia remain the same: how to rebalance its economy as the decade-long mining boom comes to an end. Growth is slowing in resource-hungry China , Australiaâs largest trading partner and by far the biggest purchaser of its exports. And that dependence is increasing â in the second quarter of 2013, China accounted for 35.4 per cent of all goods exported from Australia, its highest ever level. Abbott underlined the importance of this relationship in his first appearance on the international stage as prime minister, at the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in Bali in early October. After his first meeting with the Chinese president, Xi Jinping , Abbott declared his determination to finalise a free trade agreement with China within 12 months. Itâs an ambitious deadline â talks between the two nations have been dragging on since 2005 and gone through 19 separate rounds but have stalled on Chinaâs demands that restrictions on foreign investment be relaxed. Give way Another sticking point is Chinaâs refusal to raise quotas on Australian agricultural imports, such as wool, beef and dairy products, as it attempts instead to boost production domestically. The fear in Australia has long been that the Chinese will buy up large swathes of Australian farmland if restrictions are eased. However, after his meeting with the Chinese premier, Abbott indicated that Australia might be prepared to give way on a number of issues in order to secure a deal that will be crucial to Australiaâs continued economic prosperity. âI have always taken the view that you should take what you can get today and pitch for the rest tomorrow, when you have a strong foundation to build upon,â Abbott said. Domestic discussions about Australiaâs prospects are dominated by fears over the slowdown of China and the end of the mining boom. In April, the IMF cut its 2013 growth forecasts for Australia to 2.5 per cent, down from 3 per cent, and it expects unemployment, currently 5.6 per cent, to rise above 6per cent for the first time in a decade. But the country is in much better shape economically than much of the rest of the developed world, particularly when measured against some of the bombed-out economies in the euro zone. It has avoided the recessions that have engulfed other nations in the wake of the global financial crisis and, partly thanks to the sizeable and swift stimulus package brought in by the Labor government in 2009, has an enviable record of 22 years of unbroken economic growth. Australia is one of only eight members of the elite â9Asâ club â a country with a Triple A rating and stable outlook from all three of the major ratings agencies, Moodyâs, S&P and Fitch . Earlier this year, Fitch reaffirmed its AAA rating, saying Australia âhas remained one of the strongest performing economies in the AAA universe since the global financial crisis began.â That confidence is not reflected in consumer sentiment, however, something that can perhaps be explained by the economic negatives batted back and forth in the election campaign.
The IHCA has expressed grave concern at premium rises introduced by the Medical Protection Society, ... The IHCA has expressed grave concern at premium rises introduced by the Medical Protection Society, the UK-based insurer which provides professional indemnity for most Irish consultants, on foot of the surge in claims Medical negligence claims against consultants rose by one-third in 2012 compared to the previous year, prompting a significant rise in insurance costs, according to the Irish Hospital Consultants Association. The association has expressed grave concern at premium rises introduced by the Medical Protection Society , the UK-based insurer which provides professional indemnity for most Irish consultants, on foot of the surge in claims. The increases range from 25 per cent for consultants in low and medium risk areas to 28 per cent in high, âupper highâ and âsuper highâ risk categories and 33 per cent for obstetricians. The scale of the increases may make indemnity cover unaffordable for some consultant specialities, the IHCA warned in its annual report presented to members at the weekend. Following talks with the MPS, it said both groups would seek to identify ways to stop the increase in subscription rates as well as pursuing reductions in the âdisproportionately highâ costs of medical negligence claims in Ireland . The cost of processing most personal injury cases, especially in relation to legal fees, has been significantly reduced in recent years by transferring the handling of claims from the courts to the Injuries Claims Board Ireland. However, this body does not deal with medical negligence cases. The IHCAâs annual conference also heard that 70 consultants have applied to the HSE for a change of contract; most applications involved changes which would allow the person concerned to carry out more private work. About one-quarter of the applications were approved but 10 per cent were deemed ineligible. The association says it is unacceptable that many applications are waiting for long periods, some for more than a year, for a decision. Various contracts are in force for consultants, including type A, which offers a higher salary but restricts work to the public system, and type B, which allows limited private practice on-site in addition to work in public hospitals. Notwithstanding the difficulties in recruiting consultants, the association recorded a small increase in membership last year, to 2,424. Comments are closed for this article.
The countryâs unemployment rate, as measured by the Live Register, fell to 12.5 per cent last month,... The countryâs unemployment rate, as measured by the Live Register, fell to 12.5 per cent last month, its lowest level in three and a half years. In an another welcome boost for the Government, the latest figures from the Central Statistic Office showed the number of people claiming benefits dropped by 3,400 in November, the 17th successive monthly decline. This brought the overall number of claimants down to 406,200 at the end of October, down from 409,600 the previous month, giving a standardised rate of unemployment of 12.5 per cent. The unadjusted register, which fails to take account of part-time and seasonal workers as well as those on Jobseekerâs Allowance, was 391,507. Over the past 12 months, the number on the register has dropped by 25,770 or 6.2 per cent. The figures also showed the number of long-term claimants on the dole for more than a year had fallen to 179,758, as against 182,401 the previous month and 186,562 a year ago. The unemployment rate, based on the Live Register, has declined steadily since its post-crash peak of 15.1 per cent in February last year. The CSOâs Quarterly National Household Survey, released last month, indicated unemployment stood at 12.8 per cent in the third quarter of 2013, down from 13.6 per cent in the second quarter. Conall Mac Coille, chief economist with Davy stockbrokers, said Irelandâs unemployment rate has now almost converged to the euro area aggregate of 12.1 per cent. â Live Register numbers reinforce our view that the underlying trends in the Irish economy are more favourable than suggested by the GDP data and that the economy should rebound in the second half of 2013,â he said. Alan McQuaid of Merrion Stockbrokers said: âWhile emigration has clearly been a factor in bringing the unemployment figures down, there are encouraging signs on the labour market front.â The Small Firms Association called on Government to tackle the social welfare trap and put the best interests of the Irish economy above their re-election ambitions. Mark Fielding of Irish Small & Medium Enterprises Association said the social welfare trap was ânot only acting as a disincentive to taking up gainful employment but also directly leading to increased black economy activity, which threatens the viability of legitimate businessesâ. âThey are doing nobody any favours by allowing embedded high business costs and a culture of social welfare dependency to become entrenched in Irish society,â he said.

The first national audit into the death of babies in the weeks before or after birth shows that perinatal mortality rates here compare very favourably with UK and European figures. The perinatal mortality rate for 2011 was 6.1 per 1,000 births and rates have continued to decrease since then. Perinatal mortality is regarded as an important indicator of the quality of obstetric and neonatal care. It refers to the death of babies in the weeks before or after birth including stillbirths â babies born with no signs of life after 24 weeks of pregnancy or weighing at least 500g â and the deaths of babies within 28 days of being born. Director of the National Perinatal Epidemiology Centre (NPEC), Prof Richard Greene , said, âThe figures for Ireland are very good, showing low rates of perinatal deaths. They are similar or better than the UK and European figures which is very reassuring. And our rates have decreased by about 10 per cent in the four years since the NPEC reported national figures.â National audit The national audit, which is being launched today, was carried out by the NPEC based in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology at University College Cork , in collaboration with the medical and midwifery staff from the 20 individual maternity units around the State. A total of 491 perinatal deaths in 2011 were recorded, arising from 74,265 births of at least 24 weeks gestation or at least 500g in birthweight. Stillbirths, deaths within the first seven days of life (early neonatal deaths) and deaths within the first eight to 28 days of life (late neonatal deaths) accounted for 318 (65 per cent), 138 (28 per cent) and 35 (7 per cent) of the 491 deaths respectively. Major congenital anomaly was the most common cause of death accounting for 26 per cent of stillbirths, 51 per cent of deaths within seven days and 57 of deaths in the 8-28 day range. Prof Greene said in other countries, pregnancies where congenital or chromosomal abnormalities were detected, were often terminated at an earlier stage, but this was not the case in Ireland due to abortion laws. If only normally formed babies were taken into account, the perinatal mortality rate would reduce to 4.1 per 1,000. Comments are closed for this article.

UK economic growth reaches three-year high UK economic growth reaches three-year high Economy expanded 0.8 per cent in the three months to September, up from 0.7 per cent in the second quarter The UK economy is now larger than the Bank of England expected it to be at the end of the year The UK economy grew at its fastest pace for more than three years in the last quarter, as the broadly based recovery accelerated. Official figures released yesterday showed the economy expanded 0.8 per cent in the three months to September, up from 0.7 per cent in the second quarter. Chancellor of the exchequer George Osborne celebrated the strong figures tweeting: âThis shows that Britainâs hard work is paying off and the country is on the path to prosperity.â This month, the International Monetary Fund dropped its criticism of Mr Osborneâs austerity drive and revised upwards the UKâs growth forecast for this year by more than any other leading economy. Healthy growth The main components of the index, production, services and construction, rose by 0.5 per cent, 0.7 per cent and 2.5 per cent, respectively. Within production, manufacturing grew by a healthy rate of 0.9 per cent. The output from services is slightly above the pre-recession peak in 2008, but output in production industries and in construction remains more than 12 per cent below the 2008 peak level. Output in the third quarter was 1.5 per cent larger than last year, but still 2.5 per cent below where it was before the financial crisis struck. But some of this gap can be explained by the fall in North Sea oil and gas production, according to Simon Ward, chief economist at Henderson Global Investors. He pointed out that non-oil output was just 1.6 per cent below peak in the third quarter. The UK economy is now larger than the Bank of England expected it to be at the end of the year. In its inflation report in August, the bank forecast growth in the third quarter to be 0.5 per cent, although it then revised its forecast to 0.7 per cent. â Comments are closed for this article.
Unemployment rate falls to 7%, the lowest in five years Unemployment rate falls to 7%, the lowest in five years Job applicants wait to enter a career fair in New York last Wednesday. The US unemployment rate fell from 7.3 to 7 per cent, the lowest since November 2008. Photograph: Marilynn K Yee/The New York Times The US added 203,000 jobs in November as another month of strong jobs growth increased the chances of the Federal Reserve slowing its asset purchases from $85 (â¬62 billion) billion a month. Jobs growth came in ahead of expectations of 185,000 and the unemployment rate fell from 7.3 to 7 per cent â the lowest since November 2008. The figures suggest robust jobs growth in October was no fluke and the US labour market is picking up speed. Average jobs growth for the past three months is 193,000. Novemberâs payrolls data creates a close call for the Fed at its December meeting: they are not the kind of outstanding figure that would make âtaperingâ an easy decision but add to growing evidence of momentum in the economy. The Fed is paying close attention to Novemberâs jobs data after the October report was distorted by a three-week government shutdown. Job gains were spread across the economy, with the manufacturing sector adding 27,000 jobs, 17,000 new positions in construction, 22,300 in retail, 30,500 in transport, and 29,600 in healthcare. â Comments are closed for this article.
Wenger shock at Newcastle dip Wenger shock at Newcastle dip Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger has admitted he is at a loss to explain why Newcastle are languishing in the bottom half of the table. The Gunners travel to St James' Park on Wednesday, with Newcastle 14th in the Premiership after a troubled season. And Wenger said: "At the beginning of the season you would expect them to be fighting for the top four. "I don't know how they got to be where they are. It looks to me from the outside that they have many injuries." Arsenal go into the game on the back of a 2-0 victory over Fulham on Sunday. And Wenger added: "The best way to prepare for a game is to win the previous one. We will go to Newcastle in good shape. "Fatigue won't play too big a part in the next few weeks as we have players coming back so I can rotate a bit more. "We do not play a season with 11 players and I believe that all of our squad deserve a chance in the team." Striker Thierry Henry, along with Robert Pires, scored against Fulham. And Henry afterwards described the display as "beautiful to watch". He said: "What matters is winning and the three points, of course. That is the only thing that really matters. But it is more enjoyable when you play like we did against Fulham. "We are playing as a team and that is important because there were some games when we maybe were not there as a team and suffered for that. Those were games we lost."

Wright-Phillips to start on right Wright-Phillips to start on right England coach Sven-Goran Eriksson has revealed Shaun Wright-Phillips will start against the Netherlands. But Wright-Phillips will not make his first start for England playing on the left, as had been widely expected. "Shaun Wright-Phillips will probably start the game," said Eriksson. "But I'm not going to start Wright-Phillips on the left." Eriksson also revealed that Wes Brown will start alongside Jamie Carragher in the injury-hit centre of defence. When asked if Brown and Carragher would start Eriksson replied: "I could tell you yes. "It's a blow that four or five central defenders are away because of injuries. "On the other hand it's good for Carragher and Brown to show what they can do at this level. That's positive." The England coach said that he had been impressed by Wright-Phillips' form for Manchester City. "He deserves his chance. He has been playing well all season and I look forward to seeing him." And he added that Andy Johnson and Stewart Downing - the other two new players in the squad - would also get a chance to impress. "Wright-Phillips, Downing and Johnson will start or get the chance to play some part. "Johnson was not in my plans a year ago but he is doing a great season and scoring a lot of goals. "Downing is another one making a great season. He is young, talented and there are not too many left-footed players in the squad." Return to results

Anti-spam screensaver scrapped Anti-spam screensaver scrapped A contentious campaign to bump up the bandwidth bills of spammers by flooding their sites with data has been dropped. Lycos Europe's Make Love, Not Spam campaign began in late November but its tactics proved controversial. Lycos has shut down the campaign saying it had been started to stimulate debate about anti-spam measures and had now achieved this aim. The anti-spammer screensaver came under fire for encouraging vigilante activity and skirting the edge of the law. Through the Make Love, Not Spam website, users could download a screensaver that would endlessly request data from the net sites mentioned in many junk mail messages. More than 100,000 people are thought to have downloaded the screensaver that Lycos Europe offered. The company wanted to keep the spam sites running at near total capacity to make it much less financially attractive to spammers to operate the sites. But the campaign was controversial from the moment it kicked off and many net veterans criticised it for using spamming-type tactics against the senders of junk mail. Some net service firms began blocking access to the Lycos Europe site in protest at the action. Monitoring firm Netcraft found that the anti-spam campaign was proving a little too successful. According to response-time figures gathered by Netcraft, some of the sites that the screensaver targeted were being knocked offline by the constant data requests. In a statement from Lycos Europe announcing the scrapping of the scheme, the company denied that this was its fault. "There is nothing to suggest that Make Love, Not Spam has brought down any of the sites that it has targeted," it said. "At the time that Netcraft measured the sites it claims may have been brought down, they were not in fact part of the Make Love, Not Spam attack cycle," it added. The statement issued by Lycos also said that the centralised database it used ensured that traffic to the target sites left them with 5% spare capacity. "The idea was simply to slow spammers' sites and this was achieved by the campaign," the company said. Many security organisations said users should not participate in the Lycos Europe campaign. The closure comes only days after the campaign was suspended following the outbreak of criticism. Comments are closed for this article.
Apple unveils low-cost 'Mac mini' Apple unveils low-cost 'Mac mini' Apple has unveiled a new, low-cost Macintosh computer for the masses, billed as the Mac mini. Chief executive Steve Jobs showed off the new machine at his annual MacWorld speech, in San Francisco. The $499 Macintosh, sold for Â£339 in the UK, was described by Jobs as the "most important Mac" made by Apple. Mr Jobs also unveiled the iPod shuffle, a new music player using cheaper flash memory rather than hard drives, which are used in more expensive iPods. The new computer shifts the company into new territory - traditionally, the firm is known as a design and innovation-led firm rather than as a mass-market manufacturer. The Mac mini comes without a monitor, keyboard and mouse, and a second version with a larger hard drive will also be sold for $599. The machine - which will be available from 22 January - was described by Jobs as "BYODKM... bring your own display, keyboard, and mouse". In an attempt to win over Windows PC customers, Mr Jobs said it would appeal to people thinking of changing operating systems. "People who are thinking of switching will have no more excuses," he said. "It's the newest and most affordable Mac ever." The new computer has been the subject of speculation for several weeks and while few people will be surprised by the announcement many analysts had already said it was a sensible move. In January, Apple sued a website after it published what it said were specifications for the new computer. Ian Harris, deputy editor of UK magazine Mac Format, said the machine would appeal to PC-owning consumers who had purchased an iPod. "They want a further taste of Mac because they like what they have seen with iPod." Harris added: "Everybody thought that Apple was happy to remain a niche maker of luxury computers, and moving into a market dominated by low margin manufacturers like Dell is a bold move. "But it shows that Apple is keen to capitalise on the mass market success it's had with the iPod. The Mac mini will appeal to PC users looking for an attractive, 'no fuss' computer." The new iPod shuffle comes in two versions - one offering 512mb of storage for $99 (Â£69 in the Uk) and a second with one gigabyte of storage for $149 (Â£99) - and went on sale Tuesday. The music player has no display and will play songs either consecutively or shuffled. The smaller iPod will hold about 120 songs, said Mr Jobs. Mr Jobs told the delegates at MacWorld that iPod already had a 65% market share of all digital music players. Return to results
Aragones angered by racism fine Aragones angered by racism fine Spain coach Luis Aragones is furious after being fined by The Spanish Football Federation for his comments about Thierry Henry. The 66-year-old criticised his 3000 euros (Â£2,060) punishment even though it was far below the maximum penalty. "I am not guilty, nor do I accept being judged for actions against the image of the sport," he said. "I'm not a racist and I've never lacked sporting decorum. I've never done that and I have medals for sporting merit." Aragones was handed the fine on Tuesday after making racist remarks about Henry to Arsenal team-mate and Spanish international Jose Reyes last October. The Spanish Football Federation at first declined to take action against Aragones, but was then requested to do so by Spain's anti-violence commission. The fine was far less than the expected amount of about Â£22,000 or even the suspension of his coaching licence. Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger, who was fined Â£15,000 in December for accusing Manchester United striker Ruud van Nistelrooy of cheating, believes that Aragones' punishment was too lenient. "You compare his fine and my fine, and if you consider his was for racist abuse, then you seem to get away with it more in Spain than you should," Wenger said. "He shouldn't have said what he said, and how much money is enough, I don't know but it doesn't look a big punishment." However, Aragones insists the fine is unjustified and unfair. "I have been treated like Islero (the bull that killed famous bullfighter Manolete)," said Aragones on hearing he had been fined for his actions. "I have not liked one thing about this whole affair and I do not agree with the sanction. They have looked for a scapegoat." Spain's anti-violence commission must now ratify the Spanish FA's decision and has until next week to announce its verdict. Aragones has 10 days to appeal, and the commission can also appeal. Alberto Flores, president of the Spanish FA's disciplinary committee, said no-one in the committee felt Aragones was a racist nor had "acted in a racist way." "A fine, the highest we could apply, is sufficient punishment. Suspension would have been a bit exaggerated," Flores told sports daily Marca. Comments are closed for this article.
Authorities are investigating claims about UK ad sales booked through Ireland Authorities are investigating claims about UK ad sales booked through Ireland Irelandâs âDouble Irishâ tax structure, which has helped multinationals reduce their tax liabilities, is likely to become redundant says tax expert. The UK tax authority has indicated it is investigating Google over its tax affairs following evidence from a whistleblower who claims British taxpayers are being âcheatedâ by the company. Former Google executive Barney Jones claims the internet giant has a system in place that diverts British profits through Ireland to the Bermuda tax haven. He revealed earlier this year that he has a cache of more than 100,000 emails and documents detailing the scheme. The Public Accounts Committee (PAC) yesterday criticised HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) for failing to launch legal proceedings against the company after referring Mr Jones to investigators. Jim Harra , director general for business tax, appeared to indicate that a wider investigation was taking place and insisted HMRC âalways actsâ on the evidence it is given. He told the PAC: âI acknowledge that you did refer the whistleblower to us and I believe he did confirm to the press that we met him and we took his evidence from him and that we paid a great deal of interest to what he had to tell us and that is what we do with anyone who provides evidence. We take it very seriously and we always act upon it if it indicates non compliance by a taxpayer.â Meanwhile, PwC tax partner Fergal OâRourke has told Online News that he believes the days of the âDouble Irishâ tax structure, which has helped multinationals reduce their tax liabilities, are numbered. Changes in Ireland and worldwide are inevitable, he said, primarily because the OECD is targeting tax avoidance. As such, he predicts that Ireland will eventually prohibit companies like Google and Apple from setting up units in Ireland that donât owe income taxes there.

Autumn budget incentives include abolition of employer National Insurance for under-21s Autumn budget incentives include abolition of employer National Insurance for under-21s Northern Irelandâs finance minister Simon Hamilton: said British chancellor George Osborne had made decisions that would have a âpositive impactâ. The Northern Ireland Executive will get an extra Â£136 million in funding from the UK Government to spend as it chooses over the next two years. Details of the budget boost were announced yesterday by the chancellor George Osborne in his autumn budget statement, which details the plans for the British economy. Among his incentives to help support the recovery was the abolition of employer National Insurance contributions under the age of 21, which it is estimated could save businesses in the North about Â£10 million. The Confederation of British Industry in Northern Ireland has welcomed the move, which could affect 39,000 people. âAbolishing a âjobs taxâ on employing young people under 21 will make a real difference and help towards reducing the high level of youth unemployment in Northern Ireland,â said its director, Nigel Smyth. âPositive impactâ The Northâs finance minister, Simon Hamilton, said the chancellor had made decisions that would have a âpositive impactâ. Mr Hamilton said these included the increase of Â£2.95 per week in the state pension from next April and the cancellation of a planned fuel duty rise next September that will benefit the drivers of 880,000 cars and vans in the North. He also highlighted the introduction of a married couplesâ tax allowance, which will affect about 130,000 couples in the North. But the president of the Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce, Mark Nodder, said measures introduced to help business would be ineffective unless fully implemented in the North. He said: âThe chancellorâs rates freeze will be welcomed in England but as control over Northern Ireland business rates lies with the Northern Ireland Executive, our own businesses need reassurance this cost wonât rise here too.â Return to results
Ban on menthol cigarettes will not start until 2022 Ban on menthol cigarettes will not start until 2022 MEPs have voted to ban menthol cigarettes from the start of 2022. MEPs have given the green light to the EUâs controversial tobacco directive but have watered down a number of the original proposals. While MEPs voted to ban menthol cigarettes the introduction of the full ban will not start until 2022. Similarly, they voted to restrict mandatory health warnings to 65 per cent of cigarette packaging, compared to the threshold of 75 per cent in the original European Commision proposal. Health ministers had also agreed on a 65 per cent threshold in June. The European Parliament also rejected a proposal by the European Commission that electronic cigarettes should be classified as medicinal products, though new limits will be placed on how the products are advertised. Regulation of the electronic products, which contain no tobacco but do contain nicotine, has been one of the most controversial aspects of the proposed legislation. However, EU health commissioner Tonio Borg welcomed the fact that the European Parliament voted to proceed with the negotiations, noting that discussions could now commence between the two sides on a compromise proposal. âThis will allow us to take the process of negotiations forward and to engage with Council in order to come to a meaningful agreement on the file,â the Commissioner said, adding that he was confident negotiations could be concluded before the end of the current Parliamentâs mandate next year. Representatives of the European Parliament will now negotiate with representatives of member states through the so-called EU âtrilogueâ process over the coming months in a bid to finalise an agreement before May. Taoiseach Enda Kenny had written to all Irish MEPs and members of the centre-right European Peopleâs Party (EPP) in the European Parliament urging them not to vote in favour of an amendment which would reduce the size of health warnings on cigarette packaging to 50 per cent. The parliamentâs vote on the directive was postponed last month amid widespread allegations of intense lobbying by tobacco companies and resistance from some tobacco-producing member states. In the letter sent yesterday to MEPs and co-signed by Minister for Health James Reilly , Mr Kenny said he was concerned at a proposal to reduce the size of the health warning on cigarette packaging to 50 per cent. Mr Kenny said an amendment to reduce the size of the health warning could jeopardise the conclusion of the negotiations before next yearâs European Parliament elections. .

Bank of England keeps monetary policy unchanged Bank of England keeps monetary policy unchanged Central bank leaves interest rate at record low of 0.5 per cent The Bank of England will probably leave stimulus unchanged today as the economic recovery gathers momentum. Photograph: Yui Mok/PA Wire The Bank of England kept its monetary policy unchanged today as expected, sticking to its commitment to keep interest rates steady while unemployment remains high. The central bank made no change to its Â£375 billion (â¬442 billion) of asset purchases or to its main interest rate - which has stood at a record-low 0.5 per cent since March 2009 - following the two-day meeting of its Monetary Policy Committee this week. Britainâs economy has shown signs of further recovery this month, diminishing the prospect of more asset purchases, which had been backed by a minority of policymakers until new governor Mark Carney unveiled his forward guidance strategy in August. Mr Carney said the central bank would not raise interest rates before the unemployment rate - currently 7.7 per cent - falls to 7 per cent, unless inflation threatens to get out of control. The BoE forecasts it will take until late 2016 before unemployment falls this far, despite strengthening economic growth, but most private-sector economists think unemployment will fall much faster, and financial markets price in a rate rise as soon as early 2015. Earlier this week the International Monetary Fund revised up Britainâs economic growth prospects by the biggest amount of any advanced economy, forecasting growth of 1.4 per cent this year and 1.9 per cent for 2014. The MPC made no statement alongside its monetary policy announcement, as usual, and details of its discussions will not be published until the release of minutes on October 23rd. Online News .

Blind student 'hears in colour' Blind student 'hears in colour' A blind student has developed software that turns colours into musical notes so that he can read weather maps. Victor Wong, a graduate student from Hong Kong studying at Cornell University in New York State, had to read coloured maps of the upper atmosphere as part of his research. To study "space weather" Mr Wong needed to explore minute fluctuations in order to create mathematical models. A number of solutions were tried, including having a colleague describe the maps and attempting to print them in Braille. Mr Wong eventually hit upon the idea of translating individual colours into music, and enlisted the help of a computer graphics specialist and another student to do the programming work. "The images have three dimensions and I had to find a way of reading them myself," Mr Wong told the Online News News website. "For the sake of my own study - and for the sake of blind scientists generally - I felt it would be good to develop software that could help us to read colour images." He tried a prototype version of the software to explore a photograph of a parrot. In order to have an exact reference to the screen, a pen and tablet device is used. The software then assigns one of 88 piano notes to individually coloured pixels - ranging from blue at the lower end of this scale to red at the upper end. Mr Wong says the application is still very much in its infancy and is only useful for reading images that have been created digitally. "If I took a random picture and scanned it and then used my software to recognise it, it wouldn't work that well." Mr Wong has been blind from the age of seven and he thinks that having a "colour memory" makes the software more useful than it would be to a scientist who had never had any vision. "As the notes increase in pitch I know the colour's getting redder and redder, and in my mind's eye a patch of red appears." The colour to music software has not yet been made available commercially, and Mr Wong believes that several people would have to work together to make it viable. But he hopes that one day it can be developed to give blind people access to photographs and other images. Comments are closed for this article.
Boundaries between the funny folk and money folk dissolve at Kilkenomics Festival Boundaries between the funny folk and money folk dissolve at Kilkenomics Festival At the Kilkenomics Optimistic Economics Brunch Show in Kilkenny yesterday were (from left) Bill Black, Louise Cooper and Peter Antonioni. Photograph: Dylan Vaughan âLeave the jokes alone!â warns comedian Karl Spain , after former US banking regulator Bill Black upstages him with a gag on the Friday night of Kilkenomics. âBecause thereâll be no economic theory coming from me.â The spirited comedy and economics festival, started by David McWilliams and Richard Cooke , usually has clearly defined boundaries between its funny folk and its money folk. This was a troubling demarcation dispute. âThere were union tickets coming out,â admits fellow comic Dermot Whelan the next day. The comedians, he suggests, nearly walked off the job. The highflying economists found at Kilkenomics already have a maverick disposition. This is clear at Fridayâs SAS Young Economist of the Year competition where the aforementioned Black, one of the judges, refers to a âdrug-crazed roommateâ in an anecdote and Nobel-tipped behavioural economist Dan Ariely explains the concept of scarcity with reference to overweight elephant seals who âsometimes kill the females when they copulate.â âI really hope thereâs a point to this,â says worried compere Colm OâRegan, before fine-tuning the story for the school-going audience: âWhen a male seal and female seal like each other very muchâ¦â These young economists are the future (I briefly meet one impressive young winner, Joseph Morrin). A little latter, Colin Murphyâs excellent play Guaranteed! rakes through the recent past. Five besuited actors negotiate dialogue laced with real-life speeches and Dail discussions from Irelandâs last boom/bust cycle. I feel almost nostalgic and have to stop myself joining in on the bits I know - âThe fundamentals are soundâ âThereâll be a soft landingâ âDonât talk down the economyâ. Yes, Kilkenomics is sometimes like a financial Panto. For example, whenever the gleefully villainous stripey-trousered US pundit Max Keiser takes to the stage, I get an urge to shout âHeâs behind you!â Chatting about the future of money at The Hole in The Wall with ULâs Dr Stephen Kinsella and University of Illinois professor Deirdre McCloskey, Keiser engages in some shouty populism aimed at no one in particular. âYouâre being lied to!â he says, to whoops of appreciation from the audience. Keiser has recently been an advocate of the digital currency Bitcoin. âThereâs a flying column of Bitcoin enthusiasts here,â observes compere David McWilliams. The others on the panel are sceptical about this currency. âBoo!â say the audience. âLetâs get rid of academics!â says Keiser. They cheer terrifyingly (first they came for McCloskey and Kinsella and I did not speak out). Things are more chucklesome at the âJargon Bustersâ event where comedians and economists compete to explain economic terms. (âAnimal spirits,â are explained by Karl Spain thusly: âEvery Christmas we get our dog drunkâ). After a depressing discussion of âcrony capitalism,â Dermot Whelan dramatically rips up the card itâs written on. The next card, picked at random, reads âcreative destruction.â âThat was âcreative destructionâ,â says Bill Black to a round of applause, again rousing the ire of Spain. While David McWilliams says the themes at this year Kilkenomics are less specific and more universal than before, thereâs still an eager turnout for Saturdayâs âBoom or Bubble: the Future of Irish Propertyâ.

Bridge could miss rest of season Bridge could miss rest of season Chelsea left-back Wayne Bridge could miss the rest of the season with a suspected broken ankle. The England international, 24, was hurt in an innocuous challenge with Alan Shearer during the Londoners' FA Cup defeat at Newcastle on Sunday. "We think it's a big injury," said Jose Mourinho, whose Chelsea team this week meet Barcelona in the Champions League and Liverpool in the Carling Cup final. William Gallas and Damien Duff could also miss the Barcelona game. France defender Gallas and Ireland winger Duff both picked up their injuries in the closing stages of Chelsea's 1-0 defeat at St James' Park. With Bridge having gone off after Mourinho used all three substitutes, those knocks plus Carlo Cudicini's red card meant Chelsea finished the game with seven able-bodied players. Cudicini would not have played against Barcelona, but had been promised a game in the Carling Cup final, although he will now miss the Cardiff showpiece through suspension. The manager is not planning to add any new names to his squad ahead of the trip to Barcelona, even though he has few options to replace Bridge at left-back. Celestine Babayaro left the club in January, ironically to join Newcastle, and although Gallas has deputised at left-back before, he is struggling to be fit himself. It could be that Paulo Ferreira, usually a right-back, is switched to left-back with Glen Johnson, who ended the Newcastle game in goal, playing on the right. Youngsters Ben Hudell, Joe Keenan and Sam Tillen would be options should Mourinho decide to call up a replacement, but it is unlikely he would risk an untried prospect in a Champions League tie. Bridge's injury also means Mourinho, who reportedly wants to sign Ashley Cole from Arsenal, will not have a specialist, senior left-back for the run-in to the season. "He (Bridge) has no chance of playing against Barcelona, probably will not play against Liverpool (in the Carling Cup final) and maybe not for the rest of the season," he said. "The medical department will try to do everything to recover Gallas and Duff. We will have to wait and see, but I won't cry about injuries because we will have 11 players to play on Tuesday." Shearer said he was unsure what caused Bridge's injury. "I don't know what happened." he said. "It was just a shame. I don't think we even touched each other. "By all accounts it's pretty serious. I went into the dressing-room after the game and wished him all the best." Mourinho, whose team are chasing three trophies, has already lost winger Arjen Robben to a serious injury.

California sets fines for spyware California sets fines for spyware The makers of computer programs that secretly spy on what people do with their home PCs could face hefty fines in California. From 1 January, a new law is being introduced to protect computer users from software known as spyware. The legislation, which was approved by Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, is designed to safeguard people from hackers and help protect their personal information. Spyware is considered by computer experts to be one of the biggest nuisance and security threats facing PC users in the coming year. The software buries itself in computers and can collect a wide range of information. At its worst, it has the ability to hijack personal data, like passwords, login details and credit card numbers. The programs are so sophisticated they change frequently and become impossible to eradicate. One form of spyware called adware has the ability to collect information on a computer user's web-surfing. It can result in people being bombarded with pop-up ads that are hard to close. In Washington, Congress has been debating four anti-spyware bills, but California is a step ahead. The state's Consumer Protection Against Spyware Act bans the installation of software that takes control of another computer. It also requires companies and websites to disclose whether their systems will install spyware. Consumers are able to seek up to $1,000 in damages if they think they have fallen victim to the intrusive software. The new law marks a continuing trend in California towards tougher privacy rights. A recent survey by Earthlink and Webroot found that 90% of PCs are infested with the surreptitious software and that, on average, each one is harbouring 28 separate spyware programs. Currently users wanting protection from spyware have turned to free programs such as Spybot and Ad-Aware. Comments are closed for this article.
Call for âconservative diagnosisâ after guidelines for disorder changed Call for âconservative diagnosisâ after guidelines for disorder changed The numbers of children diagnosed with ADHD globally have ârisen steeply over the last decadeâ Children are being wrongly diagnosed with mild or moderate levels of attention-deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) because medical rules have been softened, according to major international research. The numbers of children diagnosed with ADHD globally have ârisen steeply over the last decadeâ, according to the joint Australian-Dutch research. However, they warn that the numbers being diagnosed could jump even more significantly following changes to international medical diagnostic rules introduced earlier this year. Paper published The paper, published today by the British Medical Journal, is written by Rae Thomas from Bond University, Australia; Prof Geoffrey Mitchell from the University of Queensland and Laura Batstra , assistant professor at the University of Groningen in the Netherlands. âSevere cases of ADHD are obvious, but in mild and moderate cases â which constitute the bulk of all ADHD diagnoses â subjective opinions of clinicians differ,â they write. Urging âconservative diagnosisâ, the team recommended guidelines operating in Britain, which advocate âa watchful waiting period of 10 weeksâ, followed by a parent training programme and then referral onwards if symptoms do not improve. Calling for changes, they said that reductions in the âthreshold for diagnosing ADHD devalues the diagnosis in those with serious problemsâ. Children are diagnosed according to criteria laid down in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), or in the International Classifications of Diseases (ICD-10). The rules laid down by ICD-10 are âmore restrictiveâ, say the researchers, but âmost practitioners use DSMâ â but the latter has been broadened even further in its scope. Despite extensive research, medical science is âno closer to understanding the cause or causesâ of ADHD. âThe broadening of the diagnostic criteria in DSM-5 is likely to increase what is already a significant concern about overdiagnosis. âIt risks resulting in a diagnosis of ADHD being regarded with scepticism to the harm of those with severe problems who unquestionably need sensitive, skilled specialist help and support,â the three declared. The latest changes to the DSM-5 guidelines widen âthe definition of ADHD by expanding behavioural descriptions to include more examples and increasing the maximum age of symptom onset from seven to 12 years. âThese changes are a cause for concern because they increase the risk of confusing ADHD with normal development processes, such as pubertal restlessness and distractibility.â Furthermore, the researchers warn that the DSM-5 wording to be used to describe impaired functioning has changed from âclinically significantâ to something that interferes âwith or reduce the quality of social, academic, or occupational functioning.â Prevalence of ADHD The reported prevalence of ADHD in the United States rose by nearly 50 per cent between 1997 and 2007: âIt is likely that clinicians are better at detecting and diagnosing ADHD â but it is also thought that some of the rise reflects overdiagnosis or misdiagnosis.â In the United States, 86 per cent of children said to have ADHD are described as being mildly, or moderately affected by the disorder, which causes hyperactivity, impulsivity and intention. In Australia, the amount of drugs prescribed to treat children rose by 72 per cent between 2001 and 2001, while in Britain prescriptions doubled for children and adolescents and jumped four-fold for adults between 2003 and 2008. Research so far offers âdiffering conclusionsâ about the benefits of drug treatments âin the short term, and few studies have examined long-term benefitsâ.
Cebit opens to mobile music tune Cebit opens to mobile music tune Cebit, the world's largest hi-tech fair, has opened its doors in Hanover for a look at the latest technologies for homes and businesses. There are more than 6,000 exhibitors registered and about 500,000 visitors are expected to pass through the doors. Third generation mobiles, the digital home and broadband are key themes at the show. Camera phones will get better resolutions as vendors set out to prove that bigger is definitely better. Samsung is set to steal some initial limelight with the launch of a 7-megapixel phone on the opening day. The SCH-V770 has some of the features of high-end digital single lens reflex cameras such as manual focus and the ability to attach a telephoto or wide-angle lens. Camera phones are likely to prove an interesting battle ground at the show, said Ben Wood, principal analyst at research firm Gartner. "It is firmly established that cameras are an integral part of phones and now the technology arms race is on in terms of megapixels. There will be a certain amount of 'look how big mine is'," he said. There will also be increasing focus on music-enabled mobiles. "At 3GSM in Cannes everyone went music mad and music is going to be a big theme for all the vendors at Cebit," said Mr Wood. Sony Ericsson will use the fair to show off the W800 - its recently unveiled Walkman branded phone - and there is speculation that Motorola may unveil its ROKR handset, widely tipped as the first to carry Apple's iTunes music software. Apple and Motorola announced they were getting together at the end of last year as a result of a long-standing friendship between Motorola's chief executive Ed Zander and Steve Jobs. Some analysts think Motorola may save the launch for CTIA, a wireless show in America the following week, which could be a telling sign about how operators are coming to view the German tech fair. "One of the interesting things is that CeBIT is clearly a show in decline," said Mr Wood. "A lot of the big players, such as Nokia, are pulling back saying it is hard to justify a big presence at all of the shows. It could be the last big year for Cebit," he said. Other themes include TV-enabled mobiles which are bound to create a buzz in the halls as Vodafone unveils a prototype handset that can show live digital television. There has been a glut of recent headlines about mobile TV - French operators are teaming up, O2 is trialling a system in Oxford, UK, and Nokia begins trialling a system in Finland with the Finnish Broadcasting Company, YLE TV and commercial TV channels. Cebit could become the battleground for the two competing methods for getting TV on to mobiles, and is also likely to provide a stage for a technology slated to compete with 3G. HSDPA (High Speed Downlink Packet Access) has been described as "3G on steroids" and could offer consumers much faster download times. For instance, a song which currently takes one and a half minutes to download to a phone could be done in 10 seconds. Korean giants LG Electronics and Samsung will show off HSDPA handsets at the show and the technology is set to be rolled out in the US, Europe and Korea next year. Broadband will continue to be a key theme at the show with internet telephony proving this year's killer application. Germany's largest online service provider, T-Online, is tipped to reveal software for low-cost net telephony which would see it competing with its parent company Deutsche Telekom. Cebit is used by many to unveil cutting edge products and in the mobile sphere this is likely to mean a lot of bright, colourful handsets as fashion continues to compete with technology when it comes to the device everyone has in their pockets. Rainbow-coloured phones, influenced by handsets from Japan, are just one example of how Asian companies will stamp their mark on this year's show, at which they will have their biggest ever presence. Cebit organisers have created a digital home in Hall 25 of the 27 hangar-like buildings that will house the show. "The digital home will be a hyped theme at the show. The house will be totally wired and full of things that can be used for home entertainment," said Cebit organiser Gabriele Dorries. Comments are closed for this article.
China 'to overtake US net use' China 'to overtake US net use' The Chinese net-using population looks set to exceed that of the US in less than three years, says a report. China's net users number 100m but this represents less than 8% of the country's 1.3 billion people. Market analysts Panlogic predicts that net users in China will exceed the 137 million US users of the net by 2008. The report says that the country's culture will mean that Chinese people will use the net for very different ends than in many other nations. Already net use in China has a very different character than in many Western nations, said William Makower, chief executive of Panlogic. In many Western nations desktop computers that can access the net are hard to escape at work. By contrast in China workplace machines are relatively rare. This, combined with the relatively high cost of PCs in China and the time it takes to get phone lines installed, helps to explains the huge number of net cafes in China. Only 36% of Chinese homes have telephones according to reports. "Net usage tends to happen in the evening," said Mr Makower, "they get access only when they go home and go off to the internet caf&#233;." "Its fundamentally different usage to what we have here," he said. Net use in China was still very much an urban phenomenon with most users living on the country's eastern seaboard or in its three biggest cities. The net is key to helping Chinese people keep in touch with friends, said Mr Makower. Many people use it in preference to the phone or arrange to meet up with friends at net cafes. What people can do on the net is also limited by aspects of Chinese life. For instance, said Mr Makower, credit cards are rare in China partly because of fears people have about getting in to debt. "The most popular way to pay is Cash-On-Delivery," he said, "and that's quite a brake to the development of e-commerce." The arrival of foreign banks in China, due in 2006, could mean greater use of credit cards but for the moment they are rare, said Mr Makower. But if Chinese people are not spending cash online they are interested in the news they can get via the net and the view it gives them on Western ways of living. "A large part of the attraction of the internet is that it goes below the radar," he said. "Generally it's more difficult for the government to be able to control it." "Its real value is as an open window onto what's happening elsewhere in the world," he said. Government restrictions on how much advertising can appear on television means that the net is a source of many commercial messages Chinese people would not see anywhere else. Familiarity with the net also has a certain social cachet. "It's a sign of them having made it that they can use the internet and navigate around it," said Mr Makower.

Concern about Irish tax reflects disquiet about Google Concern about Irish tax reflects disquiet about Google German demand about tax is opposition to taxpayer bailouts of banks and disquiet over tiny sums in tax paid by digital giants The main focus of the SPDâs concern appears to be Angela Merkelâs support for the use of the European Stability Mechanism to directly recapitalise ailing banks across the euro zone Reports that Irelandâs tax policy has become an issue in coalition talks in Germany between Chancellor Angela Merkelâs Christian Democrats and the centre-left Social Democrats (SPD) have set off a festival of self-righteousness and bluster among our politicians. The prize this time must go to Fianna FÃ¡il leader MicheÃ¡l Martin, who called on TÃ¡naiste Eamon Gilmore to go to Berlin to confront the leaders of Labourâs German sister party âand make it clear that their demand to interfere with our corporation tax rate is unacceptableâ. And Mr Martin warned Germanyâs politicians that âposturing on the future of Irelandâs corporation tax regime is unacceptable and must stopâ. Growing disquiet In fact, the SPDâs demands about tax are anything but a posture and they are less an expression of antipathy towards Ireland than of popular opposition to taxpayer bailouts of banks and growing disquiet over the tiny sums in tax paid by digital giants such as Google . These sentiments are shared across Europe and in the United States , where tax avoidance by multinational corporations is a live political issue. The main focus of the SPDâs concern appears to be Dr Merkelâs support for the use of the European Stability Mechanism, the European Unionâs permanent bailout fund, to directly recapitalise ailing banks across the euro zone. The Social Democrats instead favour the establishment of a common European bank resolution fund that would be financed by the financial services industry itself through the introduction of a new tax on financial transactions. Eleven of the euro zoneâs 17 member states have already committed to moving ahead with such a tax but the plans have stalled in recent months and EU legal experts have warned that the tax as currently envisaged could be illegal. The loudest opposition to the financial transaction tax comes from Britain, which is outside the euro zone but fears the City of London could suffer if the tax is introduced elsewhere. Inside the currency zone, the staunchest critics are Luxembourg , the Netherlands and Ireland â all three of which are viewed across Europe, if not strictly speaking as tax havens, as prime locations for tax avoidance. The difference between the three is that, unlike Ireland, the Netherlands and Luxembourg are not trying to tap a common European fund for billions to recapitalise their banks. And SPD budget spokesman Carsten Schneider stated bluntly last week that âanyone who wants a common resolution fund must agree to a financial transaction taxâ. The other Irish issue said to be at stake in the German coalition talks is the possibility that, after Ireland exits the bailout programme on December 15th, the EU and the International Monetary Fund should continue support in the form of a precautionary credit line. The Social Democrats are reportedly insisting that no such credit line should be extended until Ireland agrees not only to support the financial transaction tax but also to make significant concessions on corporate tax. Hours after that report was published, Taoiseach Enda Kenny was pledging to the Dublin Chamber of Commerce that the 12.5 per cent corporate tax rate remains sacrosanct. But the current interest in Irelandâs corporate tax regime across Europe and beyond has less to do with the rate than with the rules applied to multinational companies that set up here. And the reason the issue will not move off the international agenda is that public opinion around the world is increasingly outraged by the behaviour of the digital behemoths. Last week, Google reported that it had funnelled â¬8.8 billion in royalty payments to Bermuda in 2012, using legal but controversial tax structures known as the âdouble Irishâ and the âDutch sandwichâ that exploit differences between tax codes in various countries. Although Google has far more customers in other European countries, almost all its European income is earned in Ireland â a practice described earlier this year by British parliamentarian Margaret Hodge as âdevious, calculating and unethicalâ. Heightened scrutiny of their tax affairs comes as the digital giants have lost much of their remaining gloss following revelations about how they exploit user data and share information about customers with intelligence agencies. As digital commerce expands and more companies take advantage of complicated, international tax structures, popular outrage is certain to grow and the pressure on Ireland is likely to mount. In this context, bleating about sovereignty while asking for financial support from other EU states may not be the most persuasive response to criticism of Irelandâs tax regime. It would be wiser to start thinking about how the tax system can remain competitive without being so vulnerable to criticism that it is exploitative and unfair. .

Concern over RFID tags Concern over RFID tags Consumers are very concerned about the use of radio frequency ID (RFID) tags in shops, a survey says. More than half of 2,000 people surveyed said they had privacy worries about the tags, which can be used to monitor stock on shelves or in warehouses. Some consumer groups have expressed concern that the tags could be used to monitor shoppers once they had left shops with their purchases. The survey showed that awareness of tags among consumers in Europe was low. The survey of consumers in the UK, France, Germany and the Netherlands was carried out by consultancy group Capgemini. The firm works on behalf of more than 30 firms who are seeking to promote the growth of RFID technology. The tags are a combination of computer chip and antenna which can be read by a scanner - each item contains a unique identification number. More than half (55%) of the respondents said they were either concerned or very concerned that RFID tags would allow businesses to track consumers via product purchases. Fifty nine percent of people said they were worried that RFID tags would allow data to be used more freely by third parties. Ard Jan Vetham, Capgemini's principal consultant on RFID, said the survey showed that retailers needed to inform and educate people about RFID before it would become accepted technology. "Acceptance of new technologies always has a tipping point at which consumers believe that benefits outweigh concerns. "With the right RFID approach and ongoing communication with consumers, the industry can reach this point." He said that the survey also showed people would accept RFID if they felt that the technology could mean a reduction in car theft or faster recovery of stolen items. The tags are currently being used at one Tesco distribution centre in the UK - the tags allow the rapid inventory of bulk items. They are also in use as a passcard for the M6 Toll in the Midlands, in the UK. Mr Vetham said the majority of people surveyed (52%) believed that RFID tags could be read from a distance. He said that was a misconception based on a lack of awareness of the technology. At least once consumer group - Consumers Against Supermarket Privacy Invasion and Numbering (Caspian) - has claimed that RFID chips could be used to secretly identify people and the things they are carrying or wearing. All kinds of personal belongings, including clothes, could constantly broadcast messages about their whereabouts and their owners, it warned. Comments are closed for this article.
Country places behind Spain and Greece in EU ranking Country places behind Spain and Greece in EU ranking Ireland also has one of the highest ratios of government debt to GDP at 117.4 per cent, behind Greece (156.9%), Italy (127.0%) and Portugal (124.1%). Photographer: Hannelore Foerster/Online News Ireland had the third largest deficit in the European Union in 2012 according to new figures from Eurostat . Ireland, with a deficit in percentage of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of 8.2 per cent, placed third behind other debt-burdened countries Spain (10.6%) and Greece (9.0%). In 2012 the lowest government deficits in percentage of GDP were recorded in Estonia and Sweden (both -0.2%), Luxembourg (-0.6%) and Bulgaria (-0.8%), while Germany (+0.1%) registered a government surplus. Seventeen Member States had deficits higher than 3 per cent of GDP. According to the data, fifteen Member States recorded an improvement in their government balance relative to GDP in 2012 compared with 2011, with twelve worsening and one remaining stable. When it comes to the ratio of government debt to GDP,Ireland again placed highly, with the fourth highest ratio of 117.4 per cent, behind Greece (156.9%), Italy (127.0%) and Portugal (124.1%).

DVD copy protection strengthened DVD copy protection strengthened DVDs will be harder to copy thanks to new anti-piracy measures devised by copy protection firm Macrovision. The pirated DVD market is enormous because current copy protection was hacked more than five years ago. Macrovision says its new RipGuard technology will thwart most, but not all, of the current DVD ripping (copying) programs used to pirate DVDs. "RipGuard is designed to... reduce DVD ripping and the resulting supply of illegal peer to peer," said the firm. Macrovision said the new technology will work in "nearly all" current DVD players when applied to the discs, but it did not specify how many machines could have a problem with RipGuard. Some Online News News website users have expressed concerns that the new technology will mean that DVDs will not work on PCs running the operating system Linux. The new technology will be welcomed by Hollywood film studios which are increasingly relying on revenue from DVD sales. The film industry has stepped up efforts to fight DVD piracy in the last 12 months, taking legal action against websites which offer pirated copies of DVD movies for download. "Ultimately, we see RipGuard DVD... evolving beyond anti-piracy, and towards enablement of legitimate online transactions, interoperability in tomorrow's digital home, and the upcoming high-definition formats," said Steve Weinstein, executive vice president and general manager of Macrovision's Entertainment Technologies Group. Macrovision said RipGuard would also prevent against "rent, rip and return" - where people would rent a DVD, copy it and then return the original. RipGuard is expected to be rolled out on DVDs from the middle of 2005, the company said. The new system works specifically to block most ripping programs - if used, those programs will now most likely crash, the company said. Macrovision has said that Rip Guard can be updated if hackers find a way around the new anti-copying measures. Comments are closed for this article.
Desailly backs Blues revenge trip Desailly backs Blues revenge trip Marcel Desailly insists there is no chance of history repeating itself when Chelsea take on Barcelona on Wednesday. The French star was part of the Chelsea side crushed 5-1 at the Nou Camp in the Champions League quarter-final second leg in 2000. "Things will be totally different this time," he told Online News Sport. "Now everyone knows about Chelsea and is a little bit afraid of them. They are one of the major clubs in Europe and the pressure will be on Barcelona." Chelsea have not played Barcelona since that quarter-final tie five years ago. The Blues had looked destined to progress after winning the first leg at Stamford Bridge 3-1, courtesy of two goals from Tore Andre Flo and one by Gianfranco Zola. But they collapsed in the second leg, going down to strikes from Rivaldo (2), Luis Figo, Dani and Patrick Kluivert. Former Chelsea captain Desailly, who is now playing for Al-Gharafa in Qatar, says there is no comparison between that side and the current Blues team, who are top of the Premiership. "Mentally they are much stronger, even though a lot of their players are young," the 36-year-old said. "We made some mistakes at the Nou Camp in 2000 - a lot of them were individual mistakes. "It would not happen now. This team has a new motivation and a different mentality." World Cup winner Desailly saw huge changes during his time at Stamford Bridge. He was signed for Â£4.6m from AC Milan in 1998 by Ruud Gullit and went on to play under Gianluca Vialli and Claudio Ranieri. But the biggest change occurred when billionaire Roman Abramovich bought the club in 2003. Desailly says the Russian's arrival helped to instil a winning mentality at the club as well as a demand for success. "The whole of Chelsea is different now - the chairman, the manager and all the players," he said. "Everything is new and there is a huge determination to win. "Since that game in 2000, Chelsea have gained more experience in Europe and were very close to reaching the Champions League final last season." Desailly is one of the most decorated players in the history of football. He won the 1998 World Cup and 2000 European Championship with France, the Champions League in 1993 with Marseilles and 1994 with AC Milan, two Serie A titles and the FA Cup in 2000 with Chelsea. He is now winding down his career in Qatar, alongside the likes of Frank Lebeouf, Josep Guardiola, Titi Camara, Gabriel Batistuta and Christophe Dugarry. So he is full of admiration for two of his colleagues from the great Milan side of the mid-90s who are likely to line up against Manchester United on Wednesday - Paolo Maldini and Alessandro Costacurta. "I'm happy that they have managed to play so long at a high level," he said. "I made a vow to Costacurta that as long as he plays, I will continue to play. "And it's amazing that Paolo has managed to play at such a high level for such a long time." Comments are closed for this article.
Doctor found guilty of poor professional performance after STD misdiagnosis Doctor found guilty of poor professional performance after STD misdiagnosis GP failed to take patientâs monogamous relationship into account A Dublin GP has been found guilty on eight counts of poor professional performance after telling a patient she was suffering from herpes, a sexually transmitted infection, without taking into account her monogamous relationship with her husband. Colin Gleeson A Dublin GP has been found guilty on eight counts of poor professional performance after telling a patient she was suffering from herpes, a sexually transmitted infection, without taking into account her monogamous relationship with her husband. The Medical Council issued its findings today concerning Dr Iman Ekky of Drumcondra Clinic in Dublin who was facing eight allegations from a woman who can be identified only as Patient A. A report on the matter will now be presented to the board of the Medical Council who will decide what - if any - sanctions will be imposed on Dr Ekky. Patient A and her husband of 18 years had claimed they were caused undue distress following Dr Ekkyâs diagnosis of herpes in the absence of clinical evidence in April 2012. The inquiry heard on Tuesday that the GP said the condition had been dormant in Patient A. The couple sought a second opinion two days later. The second doctor diagnosed a cyst arising from a blocked Bartholinâs gland. It had been claimed it was poor professional performance to mistake a blocked Bartholinâs gland for herpes and not to take into consideration the coupleâs sexually faithful marriage. Speaking after todayâs ruling, Patient Aâs husband said the couple were relieved and delighted the episode was at an end. âThe Bartholin cyst is an extremely common condition thatâs both easily diagnosed and treated,â he said. âWe hope and pray that nobody ever again has to go through the stress, devastation and utter embarrassment for my wife and family in regard to such a treatment and misdiagnosis. âFor another couple that may be going through a rough patch or just starting out, it could have been utterly devastating,â he added. Dr Ekky was found guilty on eight counts of poor professional performance - as distinct from the more serious charge of professional misconduct. She âdiagnosed Patient A with the herpes virus and/or treated [HER]accordingly in circumstances where there was no clinical evidence of this diagnosisâ. âOn one or more occasions [SHE]informed Patient A that she was suffering from the herpes virus when she knew or ought to have known that was not the case. She failed to take into account Patient Aâs medical history, to include but not limited to Patient A informing [HER]that she was in a monogamous relationship. âShe failed to consider adequately all of Patient Aâs presenting symptoms. She prescribed Patient A the medication Daktacort, which is contra-indicated for patients who have the herpes virus, [AND]failed to maintain adequate and/or accurate medical records in respect of Patient A. â[SHE ] caused Patient A and/or her husband undue distress as a result of her informing Patient A that she had the herpes virus. She failed to extend confidence in knowledge and skill - or the application of knowledge and skill - that could reasonably be expected of a GP in respect of the totality of the treatment of Patient A.â Three more allegations of poor professional performance were withdrawn during the case. These were that Dr Ekky âfailed to carry out an adequate examination of Patient A, failed to carry out one or more diagnostic tests, [AND]failed to follow up and/or provide Patient A with the results of the swab testsâ. Dr Ekky, who qualified in 1993 had denied the allegations of poor professional performance but accepted the events caused distress and had apologised. Comments are closed for this article.
Dozens held over ID fraud site Dozens held over ID fraud site Twenty-eight people, including a Briton, have been arrested after a global operation against a website allegedly involved in identity fraud. Those arrested are accused of operating Shadowcrew.com, which investigators claim was a global clearing house for criminals involved in credit card fraud. A 19-year-old man from Camberley, Surrey, was arrested by the National Hi-Tech Crime Unit but has been bailed. Operation Firewall, led by the US Secret Service, involved seven nations. The British teenager was arrested on Wednesday but details only emerged on Friday. He has now been bailed to return to a Surrey police station in December. All 28 people detained globally are suspected of being involved in an internet-based network which stole people's identities and used computers and websites to defraud credit card companies. The authorities in the US, who have indicted 19 people in Newark, New Jersey, estimate the fraud caused losses of more than $4m. Assistant US Attorney Scott Christie said several people had been arrested in Argentina, Bulgaria, Canada, Estonia, Poland and Sweden. Mr Christie said one of the ringleaders was believed to be a Russian, Anatoly Tyukanov. Investigators from 30 law enforcement agencies worldwide spent 15 months looking into the activities of three websites - Shadowcrew, Carderplanet and Darkprofits. The US Secret Service was first tipped off in July 2003. An NHTCU spokeswoman said the American investigators went undercover on the Shadowcrew website and discovered some of the site's 4,000 members were using it for organised crime purposes. She said criminals were using the websites to traffic counterfeit credit cards and false identification information and documents such as credit cards, driver's licences, passports and birth certificates. The websites shared tips on how to commit fraud and provided a forum by which people could buy the information and tools they needed to commit such crime, she said. The Shadowcrew site, which has now been taken over by the US Secret Service, listed several discussion groups, in English and Russian, including one on hacking, spam and online anonymity tools. The head of the NHTCU, Acting Detective Chief Superintendent, Mick Deats, said: "This investigation has resulted in the significant disruption of organised criminals using the internet for profit. "We believe that the suspects have trafficked at least 1.7 million stolen credit card numbers, leading to losses by financial institutions running into the millions." Chief Supt Deats went on to warn: "The internet offers huge legitimate benefits for modern society; however with it brings powerful opportunities for those seeking to abuse those benefits for criminal gain. "Your identity is one of the most precious commodities. Criminals who try to steal the personal and financial information of ordinary citizens as well as the confidential and proprietary information of companies engaged in e-commerce, will be targeted by law enforcement."

Draft action plan on homelessness points to severe challenges delivering national policy Draft action plan on homelessness points to severe challenges delivering national policy Homeless people sleeping rough off Grafton Street in Dublin city centre. Photograph: Bryan OâBrien New figures show the number of people sleeping rough in Dublin has trebled since last year, creating heightened concern for the homeless population as winter closes in. The draft Homeless Action Plan for Dublin 2014 to 2016, indicates that a total of 305 individual people were âbedded downâ in the city in the first half of this year, as compared with 97 in the first six months of 2012 â an increase of 208 per cent. The latest ârough-sleeper countâ, conducted by the Dublin Region Homeless Executive two weeks ago, is expected to show another steep increase in the number of people sleeping rough. Action plan A homeless action plan, Sustaining the Pathway to Home, will be finalised by Dublinâs four local authorities this month, for adoption early next year. A draft of the plan, seen by The Online News, shows that one third of the 2,886 individuals using emergency homelessness services in the first six months of this year were accessing services for the first time. âThe demand for access to emergency accommodation and related homeless services in Dublin is broadening, strengthening and deepening while the challenges of procuring and delivery access to affordable and adequate housing continue unfettered,â says the plan. In 2012, 4,837 individuals used emergency services, of who 2,486 were ânew to our servicesâ. Of these, just 879 âsuccessfully moved away from homelessness into independent livingâ. âHousing first approachâ Dublinâs local authorities earlier this year adopted a âhousing firstâ approach to addressing homelessness, meaning people in homelessness should be offered long-term housing, supported if necessary, rather than hostel or emergency accommodation in the first place. Emergency accommodation is regarded as both expensive and ineffective in the long-term. Also driving this move from emergency accommodation is the âstark realityâ that an increasing number of private accommodation providers, contracted to provide B&B-type emergency accommodation, are going into receivership, resulting in a ârapid withdrawal of the use of these premises in the near futureâ. Capital expenditure on social housing has been reduced from â¬1.3 billion in 2008 to â¬275 million last year, with social housing output falling from 8,000 units to fewer than 1,500. âIt remains the case that the supply of social housing is not keeping pace with the growth of local authority housing waiting lists.â Return to results
Duff ruled out of Barcelona clash Duff ruled out of Barcelona clash Chelsea's Damien Duff has been ruled out of Wednesday's Champions League clash with Barcelona at the Nou Camp. Duff sustained a knee injury in the FA Cup defeat at Newcastle and manager Jose Mourinho said: "He cannot run. His injury is very painful, so he is out." But Mourinho has revealed defender Willian Gallas and striker Didier Drogba will be in the starting line-up. The Blues boss took the unusual step of naming his side a day before the match, with Jole Cole named in midfield. Mourinho said: "We have one more session but I think Drogba will play, and Gallas will play. "Drogba trained on Monday with no problems and will do the same on Tuesday. Gallas feels he can play and wants to play. We are protecting him still but he will be okay to play." Drogba, Chelsea's Â£24m striker, has missed the last three weeks through injury. Cech, Ferreira, Carvalho, Terry, Gallas, Tiago, Makelele, Lampard, Cole, Drogba, Gudjohnsen. Return to results
ECB considers new liquidity operation to help fragile recovery ECB considers new liquidity operation to help fragile recovery Money would be available only to banks that agree to use funding to lend to businesses [left-right] Martin Blessing, chief executive of Commerzbank , Mario Draghi, president of the European Central Bank, and Juergen Fitschen, co-chief executive of Deutsche Bank, are pictured during the European Banking Congress at the Alte Oper inÂ Frankfurt. The European Central Bank is considering a new long-term liquidity operation (LTRO) available only to banks that agree to use the funding to lend to businesses, a German newspaper reported today, citing sources. ECB president Mario Draghi and other governing council members have repeatedly mentioned the option of conducting more liquidity operations, or LTROs, to help the fragile euro zone economy and ensure the flow of credit to the private sector. The ECB extended more than â¬1 trillion of cheap three-year loans to banks through two long-term refinancing operations in late 2011 and early 2012. But this time, an option under consideration is that the banks would have access to funding via the LTRO only if they agree to pass on the money in loans to industrial, retail and services businesses, Sueddeutsche Zeitung reported on Wednesday. The new LTRO could also run for only nine or 12 months, the paper said. A new LTRO is just one possibility being considered by the ECB as it mulls fresh measures to support the economy after this monthâs decision to cut its main interest rate to a record low 0.25 per cent. A Online News poll of money market traders said such an operation could happen in the first quarter of 2014. Governing Council member Jens Weidmann said earlier this month the ECB must ensure its lending operations do not become too generous. Online News Latest Economy Return to results
Economic background and amount of âscreen-timeâ linked with poor eating Economic background and amount of âscreen-timeâ linked with poor eating Children who spent three or more hours in front of a screen were considerably more likely to consume unhealthy foods more often and five-year-olds from more socially disadvantaged families were found to have higher levels of daily screen-time One in five five-year-olds is either overweight or obese, according to findings from the Growing Up in Ireland longitudinal study published today. The latest findings represent the results of interviews with the families of 11,100 five-year-olds, previously interviewed in 2008 and 2011. The interviews were carried out between March and September this year. The problem of obesity was first identified when the children were three years old and continues to be a cause for concern. Girls are more likely than boys to be overweight. Fifteen per cent of the children are overweight and 5 per cent are obese. Some 39 per cent of those who were overweight at three years remain so at five with 11 per cent moving into the obese category while 38 per cent of those who were obese at three remained so at five. A childâs socioeconomic background continues to be associated with being overweight or obese â both occur more frequently among less advantaged families. Nine per cent of children whose mother had a Junior Certificate or less were in the obese range compared with 4 per cent of those whose mother had a degree. The study found that the average five-year-old consumed about 1,500 calories per day while children from lower income groups consumed about d 23 per cent more calories on average each day. The amount of âscreen- timeâ the children engage in â hours spent each day in front of any type of screen such as TV, smartphone, computer â is associated with poorer eating habits and higher levels of obesity. Children who spent three or more hours in front of a screen were considerably more likely to consume unhealthy foods more often and five-year-olds from more socially disadvantaged families were found to have higher levels of daily screen-time. Prof James Williams , research professor at the ESRI and principal investigator of the Growing Up in Ireland study, said the issue of obesity needed to be addressed. âIn the main our five-year- olds are in good health. However, the overweight and obesity issue is a major one. If you have a child who is manifesting these trends at this stage of their lives the chances are they have a much higher probability of sustaining that later in life into adulthood and the effects of that are felt in a number of different areas,â he said. âThe childâs immediate wellbeing is affected, their sense of self-esteem can be adversely impacted upon and their peer relationships affected. Into later life you start to pick up other issues â cardiovascular and respiratory problems and a higher chance of type 2 diabetes.â While the study found that 98 per cent of the five-year-olds were in good health, Prof Williams said it was important to remember the 2 per cent who were not. The number finding it difficult to make ends meet financially has more than doubled since the families were first interviewed five years ago at the onset of the recession. Prof Williams said the fact that one in four parents would not have been able to afford to send their child to preschool were it not for the free preschool scheme was significant. The study found that the majority of parents reported their children had adjusted well to starting school with 84 per cent of them looking forward to going to school more than once a week. Girls were more positive about school than boys. Most parents have a positive relationship with their five- year-olds, scoring very highly on positive aspects of parent- child relationship scales and being in the lower ranges of scales measuring parent-child conflict. The Growing Up in Ireland study is funded by the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and conducted by researchers led by the Economic and Social Research Institute and Trinity College Dublin .

Eriksson warned on Cole comments Eriksson warned on Cole comments Premier League bosses have told England manager Sven-Goran Eriksson to keep out of the 'tapping-up' row. Eriksson defended players' rights to talk to other clubs following allegations that Arsenal's Ashley Cole had a secret meeting with Chelsea. But a Premier League spokesman said the rules are very clear on the subject. He said: "A professional footballer under contract doesn't have the right to speak to another club without the permission of his current employer." The spokesman added: "The Premier League rules are clear on that. There is an ongoing inquiry into this matter and if it is proven that the rules have been broken then the guilty parties are liable to be punished." The Premier League is set to investigate whether Chelsea held a secret meeting with the Arsenal defender last month. Eriksson earlier said he was unconcerned if reports that Chelsea made an illegal approach prove to be true. He said: "As a professional footballer it must be your right to listen if some other work is available. "We don't live in a dictatorship, we're in a democracy. It's the same in other professions but normally no problem." He added: "Loyalty is important but contracts end and that is life in football." But former England boss Graham Taylor believes Eriksson should not get embroiled in the club issues. Taylor told Online News Radio Five Live: "I found that when I was England manager, it was somewhat unwise to get yourself involved in club matters and I don't think the club managers will take too kindly to Sven's comments." Eriksson was himself embroiled in controversy in similar circumstances when he was caught secretly meeting Chelsea chief executive Peter Kenyon in March 2004. He then agreed a contract extension on improved terms with the Football Association and insisted he had done nothing wrong. At the time he argued: "I think that I have human rights to listen to other clubs. You can never convince me I shouldn't have that right. I haven't let anyone down by listening to anyone else. "I never ever talked about money or a contract to any club. I only ever talked about whether there were possibilities if I left the FA. "I think that I have the right to do that. I think that should be allowed, even if you are England manager. It is common sense and a normal work ethic. "If some people think that's disloyal, I'm sorry about that. But to have this job is not just about sitting there, year after year, waiting to be sacked." Return to results
Europe backs digital TV lifestyle Europe backs digital TV lifestyle How people receive their digital entertainment in the future could change, following the launch of an ambitious European project. In Nice last week, the European Commission announced its Networked & Electronic Media (NEM) initiative. Its broad scope stretches from the way media is created, through each of the stages of its distribution, to its playback. The Commission wants people to be able to locate the content they desire and have it delivered seamlessly, when on the move, at home or at work, no matter who supplies the devices, network, content, or content protection scheme. More than 120 experts were in Nice to share the vision of interconnected future and hear pledges of support from companies such as Nokia, Intel, Philips, Alcatel, France Telecom, Thomson and Telefonica. It might initially appear to be surprising that companies in direct competition are keen to work together. But again and again, speakers stated they could not see incompatible, stand-alone solutions working. A long-term strategy for the evolution and convergence of technologies and services would be required. The European Commission is being pragmatic in its approach. They have identified that many groups have defined the forms of digital media in the areas that NEM encompasses. The NEM approach is to take a serious look at what is available and what is in the pipeline, pick out the best, bring them together and identify where the gaps are. Where it finds holes, it will develop standards to fill them. What is significant is that such a large and powerful organisation has stated its desire for digital formats to be open to all and work on any gadget. This is bound to please, if not surprise, many individuals and user organisations who feel that the wishes of the holder of rights to content are normally considered over and above those of the consumer. Many feel that the most difficult and challenging area for the Commission will be to identify a solution for different Digital Rights Management (DRM) schemes. Currently DRM solutions are incompatible, locking certain types of purchased content, making them unplayable on all platforms. With the potential of having a percentage of every media transaction that takes place globally, the prize for being the supplier of the world's dominant DRM scheme is huge. Although entertainment is an obvious first step, it will encompass the remote provisions of healthcare, energy efficiency and control of the smart home. The 10-year plan brings together the work of many currently running research projects that the EC has been funding for a number of years. Simon Perry is the editor of the Digital Lifestyles website, which covers the impact of technology on media Comments are closed for this article.
Featured: 'No re-draft' for EU patent law 'No re-draft' for EU patent law A proposed European law on software patents will not be re-drafted by the European Commission (EC) despite requests by MEPs. The law is proving controversial and has been in limbo for a year. Some major tech firms say it is needed to protect inventions, while others fear it will hurt smaller tech firms The EC says the Council of Ministers will adopt a draft version that was agreed upon last May but said it would review "all aspects of the directive". The directive is intended to offer patent protection to inventions that use software to achieve their effect, in other words, "computer implemented invention". In a letter, EC President Jos&#233; Manuel Barroso told the President of the European Parliament, Josep Borrell, that the Commission "did not intend to refer a new proposal to the Parliament and the Council (of ministers)" as it had supported the agreement reached by ministers in May 2004. If the European Council agrees on the draft directive it will then return for a second reading at the European Parliament. But that will not guarantee that the directive will become law - instead it will probably mean further delays and controversy over the directive. Most EU legislation now needs the approval of both parliament and the Council of Ministers before it becomes law. French Green MEP Alain Lipietz warned two weeks ago that if the Commission ignored the Parliament's request it would be an "insult" to the assembly. He said that the parliament would then reject the Council's version of the legislation as part of the final or conciliation stage of the decision procedure. In the US, the patenting of computer programs and internet business methods is permitted. This means that the US-based Amazon.com holds a patent for its "one-click shopping" service, for example. Critics are concerned that the directive could lead to a similar model happening in Europe. This, they fear, could hurt small software developers because they do not have the legal and financial might of larger companies if they had to fight patent legal action in court. Supporters say current laws are inefficient and it would serve to even up a playing field without bringing EU laws in line with the US. Return to results
Featured: âIâll never forget the pain. It was excruciatingâ âIâll never forget the pain. It was excruciatingâ Matilda Behan is still coping with the effects of an operation carried out 55 years ago Matilda Behan (82) had a symphysiotomy operation performed on her without her consent in Holles Street in 1959: â Itâs been very limiting. Itâs affected all my family.â For the past 55 years, Matilda Behan has faced daily reminders of the operation that has haunted her for life. She finds it too painful to walk any distance. She is incontinent. There is also chronic pain which never really goes away. âI take a lot of painkillers and anti-inflammatories every day,â says Behan (82) from Ringsend in Dublin. â Itâs been very limiting. Itâs affected all my family.â The legacy of health problems began, she says, after she was admitted to hospital in April 1958. Two of her children had died during childbirth and she had been told she would need a Caesarean section for any future births. âI just remember being brought into a theatre and the place was packed with people. I wasnât told what was happening,â she says. She recalls being given a local anaesthetic. Then, she says, two nurses put her hands behind her head and two doctors pulled her legs apart. âIâll never forget the pain I went through. I was screaming and being restrained. I couldnât see much except for them sawing. It was excruciating pain . . . I was just 27 and I was butchered.â Symphysiotomies involved sawing a pregnant womanâs pubic bone in half to widen the birth canal. A report commissioned by the Government last year found that use of symphysiotomies was at its peak in Ireland during the 1950s and 1960s - when it was rarely used in the rest of Europe . In all, it is estimated that about 1,500 operations were carried out . As for Behan, it was only decades later she realised that she had had a symphysiotomy. She read a newspaper report on research by Jacqueline Morrissey, who was completing a PhD on the influence of Catholic ethics on medicine. It described how the procedure was revived in Ireland in the 1950s and was carried out instead of providing contraception to women who faced the prospect of obstructed births. The issue of whether the operations were necessary is still hotly debated. The Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists recently insisted that the operation at the time appeared to offer a method of safe birth in some cases of obstructed labour. âI was never told anything, never asked for my consent,â Behan says. Even now, some of the details are still emerging. Just last year she was seen by a specialist who was shocked when he saw the damage caused by the operation. âThe consultant said my pubic bone was absolutely destroyed,â she says. âHe couldnât believe it. It was much worse than I ever realised.â The State has responded to some of her needs in recent years with medical cards for sufferers. It has taken another 12 years for a government to finally take the first step towards setting up some form of redress scheme. âCompensation would be something,â she says. âI still need an awful lot done for me. I need a carer. An admission of what was done wrong would give me some closure. And it would help me live properly for the rest of my life.â Return to results
File-swappers ready new network File-swappers ready new network Legal attacks on websites that help people swap pirated films have forced the development of a system that could be harder to shut down. One site behind the success of the BitTorrent file-swapping system is producing its own software that avoids the pitfalls of the earlier program. A test version of the new Exeem program will be released in late January. But doubts remain about the new networks ability to ensure files being swapped are "quality copies". In late December movie studios launched a legal campaign against websites that helped people swap pirated movies using the BitTorrent network. The legal campaign worked because of the way that BitTorrent is organised. That file-sharing system relies on links called "trackers" that point users to others happy to share the file they are looking for. Shutting down sites that listed trackers crippled the BitTorrent network. One of the sites shut down by the legal campaign was suprnova.org which helped boost the popularity of the BitTorrent system by checking that trackers led to the movies or TV programmes they claimed to. Now the man behind suprnova.org, who goes by the nickname Sloncek, is preparing to release software for a new file-swapping network dubbed Exeem. In an interview with Novastream web radio, Sloncek said Exeem would combine ideas from the BitTorrent and Kazaa file-sharing systems. Like BitTorrent, Exeem will have trackers that help point people toward the file they want. Like Kazaa these trackers will be held by everyone. There will be no centrally maintained list. This, said Sloncek, should make the system less vulnerable to legal action aimed at stopping people swapping pirated movies and music. The Exeem software has been under development for a few months and is currently being tested by a closed group of users. An early public version of the software should be available before February. Sloncek said that currently only a Windows version of the software was in development. There were no plans for a Linux or Mac version. He said that costs of writing the software will be paid for by adverts appearing in the finished version of the program. Despite Suprnova administrator Sloncek's involvement with Exeem, the basic technology appears to have been developed by a firm called Swarm Systems that is based on Caribbean island Saint Kitts and Nevis. Users of the Exeem system will be able to rate files being swapped to help stop the spread of fake files, Sloncek told Novastream. Dr Johan Pouwelse, a researcher at the Delft University of Technology who studies peer-to-peer networks, said Exeem was the next evolution in file-sharing systems. But, he said, it would struggle to be as popular as BitTorrent and Suprnova because early versions were not taking enough care to make sure good copies of files were being shared. "Exeem cannot prevent pollution," he said. "The rating system in Exeem seems flawed because it is easy to insert both fake files and fake ratings," he said. Studies have shown that organisations working for record labels and movie studios have worked to undermine Kazaa by putting in fakes. By contrast moderators on Suprnova made sure files being shared were high quality. "The moderators are the difference between having a system that works and one that's full of crap like Kazaa," he said. "There is a fundamental tension between distribution and integrity," he said. Mr Pouwelse said that future versions of file-sharing systems are likely to incorporate some kind of distributed reputation system that lets moderators prove who they are to the network and rate which files are worth downloading. When big files were being shared moderation systems were key, said Mr Pouwelse. He added that the legal attacks on BitTorrent had driven people away from sites such as Suprnova but many users had simply migrated to other tracker listing sites many of which have seen huge increases in traffic. "It's hard to compete with free," he said. No-one from the Motion Picture Association of America was immediately available for comment on the file-sharing development.

Football Manager scores big time Football Manager scores big time For the past decade or so the virtual football fans among us will have become used to the annual helping of Championship Manager (CM). Indeed, it seems like there has been a CM game for as many years as there have been PCs. However, last year was the final time that developers Sports Interactive (SI) and publishers Eidos would work together. They decided to go their separate ways, and each kept a piece of the franchise. SI kept the game's code and database, and Eidos retained rights to the CM brand, and the look and feel of the game. So at the beginning of this year, fans faced a new situation. Eidos announced the next CM game, with a new team to develop it from scratch, whilst SI developed the existing code further to be released, with new publishers Sega, under the name Football Manager. So what does this mean? Well, Football Manager is the spiritual successor to the CM series, and it has been released earlier than expected. At this point CM5 looks like it will ship early next year. But given that Football Manager 2005 is by and large the game that everybody knows and loves, how does this new version shape up? A game like FM2005 could blind you with statistics. It has an obscene number of playable leagues, an obscene number of manageable teams and a really obscene number of players and staff from around the world in the database, with stats faithfully researched and compiled by a loyal army of fans. But that does not do justice to the game really. What we are talking about is the most realistic and satisfying football management game to ever grace the Earth. You begin by picking the nations and leagues you want to manage teams from, for instance England and Scotland. That will give you a choice not just of the four main Scottish leagues, but the English Premiership all the way down to the Conference North and South. Of course you might be looking for European glory, or to get hold of Abramovich's millions, in which case you can take control at Chelsea, or even Barcelona, Real Madrid, AC Milan ... the list goes on a very long way. Once in a team you will be told by the board what they expect of you. Sometimes it is promotion, or a place in Europe, sometimes it is consolidation or a brave relegation battle. It might even be a case of Champions or else. Obviously the expectations are linked to the team you choose, so choose wisely. Then it is time to look at your squad, work out your tactics, seeing how much cash, if any, you have got to splash, having a look at the transfer market, sorting out the training schedule and making sure your backroom staff are up to it. Then bring on the matches, which are once more available in the ever-improving top down 2D view. With the exception of the improved user interface on the surface, not much else seems to have changed. However, there have been a lot of changes under the bonnet as well - things like the manager mind-games, which let you talk to the media about the opposition bosses. The match engine is also much improved, and it is more of a joy than ever to watch. In fact just about every area of the game has been tweaked, and it leads to an ever more immersive experience. With a game that is so complex and so open-ended, there are of course a few glitches, but nowhere near the sorts of problems that have blighted previous releases. With so many calculations to perform the game can take some time to process in between matches, though there have been improvements in this area. And a sport like football, which is so high profile and unpredictable itself, can never be modelled quite to everybody's satisfaction. But this time around a great deal of hard work has been put in to ensure that any oddities that do crop up are cosmetic only, and do not affect gameplay. And if there are problems further down the line, Sports Interactive have indicated their usual willingness to support and develop the game as far as possible. In all there are many more tweaks and improvements. If you were a fan of the previous CM games, then FM2005 might make you forget there was anything else before it. If you are new to the genre but like the idea of trying to take Margate into the Premiership, Spurs into Europe, or even putting Rangers back on the top of the tree, FM2005 could be the best purchase you ever made. Just be warned that the family might not see you much at Christmas. Football Manager 2005 out now for the PC and the Mac Return to results
German consumer sentiment jumps to six-year high German consumer sentiment jumps to six-year high Prospects of faster recovery and recent ECB interest rate cut increase morale German consumer sentiment rose to its highest in six years going into December, supporting the view that strong consumption will make up for weaker exports and help Europeâs largest economy post moderate growth this year. The GfK market research group said today its forward-looking consumer sentiment indicator, based on a survey of around 2,000 people, rose to 7.4 going into December from an upwardly revised 7.1 the previous month. It was the highest reading since August 2007. âThe consumer climate is posting a little year-end final spurt,â said GfKâs Rolf Buerkl in a statement. âThe prospects of a faster revival of the German economy as well as the (European Central Bankâs) interest rate cut are giving an extra impetus to consumer sentiment at the end of the year.â Traditionally big savers, the Germans have become more willing to spend as the jobs market remains stable and low interest rates make saving less attractive. That bodes well for Christmas trading, said GfK retail expert Wolfgang Adlwarth, predicting Germans would spend â¬288 each on Christmas presents this year, almost 1 per cent more than last year. Their propensity to spend, which has already risen, increased again in November to a seven-year high, helped by another interest rate cut from the ECB, GfK said. The related index climbed to 45.7 from 44.4 in October. A sub-index tracking consumersâ income expectations also jumped. The survey chimed with data last week showing that companiesâ expectations were at their highest since spring 2011 and were the most upbeat about their current situation since June 2012. More than half of German blue-chip companies have reported better-than-expected results in recent weeks. GfK reiterated its forecast that private consumption would rise by 1 per cent this year, double the near 0.5 percent overall economic growth it expects. It said spending would rise next year too, but declined to give any figures. The consumer climate could be boosted further by news on Wednesday that Chancellor Angela Merkelâs conservatives and the centre-left Social Democrats (SPD) have a clinched a coalition deal that rules out tax hikes. âThe fact that it now wonât come to tax increases is a positive sign for consumer morale, I would say,â GfK chief executive Matthias Hartmann told journalists in Frankfurt. Foreign trade was actually a drag on gross domestic product (GDP) growth in the third quarter and data showed last week that the economy was being propped up by domestic demand. Still, with exports traditionally the backbone of the German economy and the country posting a record current account surplus, the European Commission is investigating whether Europeâs bulwark economy is relying too much on exports.

German trade surplus hits record in September German trade surplus hits record in September But economy has come under fire for relying too heavily on foreign trade Tthe HHLA Hamburg Container Terminal Altenwerder in Hamburg, Germany. The countryâs seasonally adjusted trade surplus widened to â¬18.8 billion in September. Photograph: Michele Tantussi/Online News Germanyâs trade surplus rose to a record high in September as exports climbed across the board, data showed today, at a time when Europeâs largest economy has come under fire for relying too heavily on foreign trade. The seasonally adjusted trade surplus widened to â¬18.8 billion from a revised â¬15.8 billion in August, surpassing the consensus forecast for it to narrow to â¬15.5 billion. Until now the record had been â¬18.7 billion in September 2007. International criticism has mounted - especially from Washington - that Europeâs bulwark economy must do more to spur domestic demand and that its reliance on exports is hampering Europeâs economic stability and hurting the global economy. âThe record surplus is likely to add fuel to the flames, but I donât see a problem in them,â said Stefan Schilbe of HSBC Trinkaus, highlighting the differences of views on both sides of the Atlantic. âWith a certain delay, German companies will increase their capacities, which will help our trade partners because more goods and services will be bought from there.â The US administration reprimanded Germany in strong terms late last month in its semi-annual report to Congress for its economic imbalances. Germanyâs current account surplus, at â¬19.7 billion in September, is the biggest in the world. European Commission president Jose Manuel Barroso used softer language in Frankfurt this week but his message was similar: Germany had âhomeworkâ to do on stability in the euro zone. Conservative politicians in Germany, which has taken over the spotlight from China, were quick to reject the criticism though Chancellor Angela Merkelâs likely future coalition partner agreed more must be done to spur domestic demand. Seasonally-adjusted exports gained a forecast-beating 1.7 per cent on the month, the Federal Statistics Office data showed, while imports, expected to rise 0.6 percent, fell 1.9 percent. Exports rose to all trade partners but particularly to the European Union, which bought 5.4 per cent more goods and services from Germany. Exports to the euro zone rose by 4.4 per cent, while to non-euro zone states they climbed 7.2 per cent. âThe economy is getting help from foreign trade,â said Ralph Solveen at Commerzbank. âBut I would not cheer massively yet because the previous months were just too bad for that.â The US Treasury may feel vindicated by the data. Its criticisms come at a sensitive time in bilateral relations with tempers already running high after reports that the United States secretly monitored Dr Merkelâs mobile phone. Germany received indirect backing today from European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi when he said economic imbalances in the euro zone should be overcome without weakening the regionâs strongest economies. Germany argues it has more than halved its current account surplus with the euro zone as a share of gross domestic product since 2007. Trade is expected to subtract from rather than contribute to economic growth in 2013, while domestic demand, albeit still weak, will drive Germanyâs modest expansion. (Online News) .

Government insists new legislation will not affect pub prices Government insists new legislation will not affect pub prices The Government says the legislation targets high-strength alcohol being sold cheaply and will not affect pub prices. Photograph: Bryan OâBrien/The Online News The Government has warned it will continue to hike taxes on alcohol if the courts block plans to set a minimum price. A fixed minimum unit pricing (MUP) based on the strength of each product is among a number of measures announced by the Department of Health to get people to cut down on the amount they drink. Health warnings and advice will be on all bottles and cans, while the advertising of alcoholic products will also be limited on television, radio, print and outdoor media and in cinemas. However, a decision to ban alcohol firms from sponsoring major sports events has been put back by 12 months. Minister of State for Health Alex White denied the Cabinet had âfudgedâ the issue by appointing a group to consider the pros and cons of the controversial issue, including the value, feasibility and implications of the ban, as well as how organisations could replace lost revenue. âGovernment has decided both of these concerns have to be taken equally in to account,â he said. The proposal will be examined during the drafting of new legislation, the Public Health (Alcohol) Bill, which includes plans to set the minimum price of alcohol. Mr White warned if MUP is struck out by the courts, plan B is to continue hitting excise duty. âDefinitely, price will continue to be a major instrument in all of this,â he said. âWe prefer MUP but excise is in there as well as an option in the future.â The exact minimum price per gram of alcohol will not be fixed until after a cross-Border study in to the economic and health affects of introducing minimum pricing â possibly in both jurisdictions at the same time. Officials are also awaiting the result of a legal challenge against similar plans in Scotland, which could eventually go to the European Court of Justice. The price of a drink in pubs and nightclubs are not expected to be affected as the new legislation will target high-strength alcohol being sold cheaply in supermarkets and off-licences. Minister for Health James Reilly said Ireland has a problem with alcohol which it is not facing up to, with each person over 15 years drinking the equivalent of a bottle of vodka per week. Some 1.5 million Irish adults are said to drink in a harmful pattern, with alcohol being a contributory factor in half of all suicides and suicide attempts and associated with 16 per cent of child abuse and neglect cases. Concerns have also been raised about more people are drinking at home or getting âtanked upâ in the house before a night out missing the socialising aspect of the pub, Dr Reilly said. âAlcohol misuse in Ireland is a serious problem with 2,000 of our hospitals beds occupied each night by people with alcohol related illness or injury,â he added. âThis impacts on families and individuals at every level of society.â Medics and alcohol awareness groups said it was encouraging to finally see Government take decisive action to tackle what is a major public health issue, but claimed not dealing with the sponsorship of sports events was a missed opportunity. However, Alcohol Federation of Ireland, which represents alcohol manufacturers and suppliers in Ireland, urged the Government to engage with the drinks industry. âAs we have long acknowledged, the drinks sector has a role in ensuring that issues such as underage drinking and drinking to excess are challenged,â Kathryn DâArcy, director, said. âThe sector wants to work with the various stakeholders in the development and introduction of evidence-based solutions that will address alcohol misuse, in particular amongst young people. âEngaging with us will ensure that the Government will deliver an effective set of proposals.â The Irish Medical Organisation (IMO) welcomed the Governmentâs move. The organisationâs president, Dr Matthew Sadlier, President of the IMO, said the setting of a minimum price for alcohol was âa critical step to tackling the scourge of alcohol misuse and abuse in Ireland. Alcohol has simply become too affordable particularly for young people and this measure will help address that.â However, the IMO was critical of the failure to ban oalcohol sponsorship of sport; âWe believe that the decision not to ban alcohol sponsorship in sport is a missed opportunity,â said Dr Sadlier.

Gronkjaer agrees switch to Madrid Gronkjaer agrees switch to Madrid Jesper Gronkjaer has agreed a move to Atletico Madrid from Birmingham City. The 27-year-old winger spent just five months at St Andrews following a Â£2.2m move from Chelsea in July after playing for Denmark at Euro 2004. He is set to move during the January transfer window in a deal rumoured to be about Â£1.4m, subject to a medical. "We will meet with the player's representative to finalise the contract and decide when he will sign," said Atletico sporting director Toni Munoz. Gronkjaer has been targeted by Blues fans and was sarcastically applauded when taken off against Everton last month. Boss Steve Bruce had said that he would be happy to let the Danish international go if the price was right. He added: "I'm not going to say the decision to let him go is down to the fans' reaction towards him. "He has had a tough time since the summer with the loss of his mother and finding it difficult to adjust to a new club and a different area. "He has been terrific and not missed a day's training and is someone if your daughter brought them home you would be delighted. "It just hasn't quite worked out here for him. But we'd like to get back most of what we spent." Comments are closed for this article.
Hacker threat to Apple's iTunes Hacker threat to Apple's iTunes Users of Apple's music jukebox iTunes need to update the software to avoid a potential security threat. Hackers can build malicious playlist files which could crash the program and let them seize control of the computer by inserting Trojan code. A new version of iTunes is now available from the Apple website which solves the problem. Security firm iDefence, which notified users of the problem, recommended that users upgrade to iTunes version 4.7.1. The problem affects all users of iTunes - Windows and Mac OS - running versions 4.7 and earlier. Users can automatically upgrade iTunes by opening the "look for updates" window in the program. The security firm says users should avoid clicking on or accessing playlist files - which have the file extension of .pls or .m3u - which have come from unknown sources. Itunes is the world's most popular online music store with more than 200 million songs downloaded since it launched in 2003. Return to results
Hamm bows out for US Hamm bows out for US Women's football legend Mia Hamm has played her final game. Hamm, 32, who officially retired after this year's Athens Olympics, took to the field for the last time to help the US claim a 5-0 win over Mexico. Hamm ends her career as the most prolific scorer - male or female - in international football, with 158 goals in 276 games for the US. She was twice Fifa women's player of the year and won the World Cup in 1991 and 1999 and two Olympic golds. On her retirement, Hamm said: "There are mixed emotions. There are things in your life that you have had to put on the back-burner and you can focus more time and energy on that now. "I have to see what is out there and not commit to everything at the beginning." The friendly also saw the end of Julie Foudy and Joy Fawcett's US careers. Hamm will now embark on a new life with husband, Chicago Cubs shortstop Nomar Garciaparra, who was in the stands to watch her final game. He has just agreed a new deal with the Cubs after joining them in July. Return to results

Photograph: Frank Miller 10.3.05 Martin Wall, Pamela Duncan, Carl O'Brien One in four of the countryâs 43 State-funded voluntary hospitals and health agencies have told the Government they are breaching official policy on pay for senior executives. Figures released by the Department of Health show senior staff working in State-funded disability and maternity services are receiving total packages of well over â¬200,000 per year in some cases. The total remuneration in many cases is made up of a combination of HSE-funded salaries and top-up payments from private sources, such as the proceeds from on-campus retail outlets. Department of Health files dated from May this year â and which predate cuts introduced under the Haddington Road agreement â show for the first time the level of earnings of senior managers in voluntary hospitals and health agencies. A number of health bodies last night disputed the details set out in the Department of Health figures that were drawn up as part of a recent HSE internal audit. However senior health service sources maintained the figures were those which the agencies had themselves submitted. At the end of September, the HSE asked the voluntary hospitals and agencies to confirm that executive pay was in line with Government policy. Internal HSE figures show that 10 agencies indicated that they were breaching pay policy. The HSE figures also show that six agencies confirmed they were in compliance, while 11 others had not replied by early November. The HSE has taken this as an indication that they were in compliance. Total package The Department of Health file states the master of the Rotunda Hospital in Dublin was receiving a total package of more than â¬306,000. This included a HSE salary of â¬236,000, as well as an on-call allowance of â¬49,545 and a separate privately funded allowance of â¬20,000. The file said the master of the National Maternity Hospital was receiving a package of â¬281,892. This was composed of a HSE-funded salary of â¬183,562, as well as an allowance of â¬53,009 and a separate private-funded allowance of â¬45,000. Neither hospital responded to queries put to them last night.The publicly funded element of these payments would have been reduced under the Haddington Road deal which came into force in July. The Department of Health report also states that the chief executive of the Central Remedial Clinic (CRC) received a total package of â¬242,865. This comprised a HSE-funded salary of â¬106,900, a CRC-funded salary of â¬116,949 and a separate CRC-funded allowance of â¬19,016. The CRC described the Department of Health report as âhistoricâ and said it did not provide a current picture of staff remuneration at the organisation. The CRC also did not answer questions as to whether revenue generated from fundraising activities was used to supplement State-funded payments. The Department of Health files state that the chief executive of Stewarts Hospital, which operates in the disability sector, had a salary of almost â¬175,000 and a motor allowance of â¬18,000. Stewarts Hospital said yesterday the salary of its current chief executive was in compliance with the consolidated scales and official circulars. Comments are closed for this article.

Hospitals set difficult task of slashing budgets by end of year Hospitals set difficult task of slashing budgets by end of year Pressure also on hospitals to process thousands of extra outpatient appointments Dr James Reilly: said earlier in the year that a â¬19 million âintervention fundâ would be created to reduce waiting lists, some of which ias still available. Photograph: Eric Luke Cash-starved hospitals have been set the near impossible task of slashing budgets over the next three months while at the same time processing thousands of extra outpatient appointments in order to meet Government targets. The Health Service Executive , in a letter to all hospitals, has told health managers to ensure they âbring backâ their deficits, which currently stand at a cumulative â¬75 million. In previous years this has involved cutting services in the final months of the year. At the same time, the HSE says hospitals have developed and in some cases begun action plans designed to ensure that no patient is waiting more than 12 months for an outpatient appointment. At the end of August almost 85,000 patients were on the outpatient waiting list for more than a year, yet the target for year-end is zero. One way the waiting lists will be cut is through the implementation of a âone-strikeâ policy for the average 15,000 patients a month who fail to turn up for appointments. The HSE has instructed hospitals to use text messages and phone calls to remind patients of appointments and to warn them they will be removed from the list if they fail to attend. However, further reducing the list will require additional investment. Minister for Health James Reilly promised earlier in the year that a â¬19 million âintervention fundâ would be created to reduce waiting lists. His spokesman said yesterday some of this money was still available. The HSE recorded a deficit of â¬93.7 million for the year to the end of August, according to its latest monthly report. It is now forecasting an end-of-year deficit of â¬105 million on direct services, including a shortfall of â¬25 million on primary care reimbursement services, including medical cards. St Jamesâs Hospital is â¬10.4 million over-budget, St Vincentâs hospital has a deficit of â¬8.6 million and University Hospital Galway has overspent by â¬7.2 million. The overall deficit is likely to be far higher when account is taken of a failure to make projected savings under the Haddington Road agreement and the deferment of payments due from private health insurers until next year. Projected savings from fee cuts for doctors and other health professionals are also behind target to the tune of â¬70 million in the first eight months of the year. The HSE has calculated a figure for the projected deficit by yearâs end, but declined to release it yesterday because discussions are ongoing in relation to health insurance and other issues. Some 45,155 adults and children were on waiting lists for elective procedures in August, while a further 76,617 were waiting for gastrointestinal procedures, the monthâs national performance assurance report states. Some 374,104 people were on the outpatient waiting list, of whom 2,236 patients are waiting four years or more. The report shows there is little likelihood of the HSE meeting a range of performance targets by the end of the year. There were, for example, 2,087 adults waiting more than eight months for an inpatient elective procedure in August; the target is to clear this list by the end of December. Return to results
IMF report indicates scope exists for taking more from big earners IMF report indicates scope exists for taking more from big earners For every quarter of a point the ECB lowers its rates, the monthly cost of servicing a â¬100,000 tracker mortgage falls by about â¬15 so the average tracker mortgage holder with an outstanding loan of â¬300,000 will see monthly savings of â¬45 from the beginning of next month. Ireland is among a number of countries that have bucked the trend of recent decades by increasing their income tax rate for top earners quite substantially, according to a report published yesterday by the International Monetary Fund . However, the report also indicates it would be possible to raise more income from top income earners. Marginal rate While the top marginal rate for Ireland is now in the mid-50s, it could be raised to close to 70 per cent while still maximising the potential return for the exchequer, the IMF believes. A review in the report shows that the top marginal rate in most advanced economies, including Ireland, is at the lower end of the range of revenue-maximising rates available. The IMFâs Fiscal Monitor Report for October, published as the Government makes its final preparations for next weekâs budget, looks at how tax reform could help strengthen public finances around the globe. It notes that tax has played a bigger role in closing public deficits than initially planned, with rates being raised where it might have been preferable to broaden the tax base and introduce new taxes to address environmental issues or correct financial sector inefficiencies. In its review of fiscal consolidation progress around the globe, it says Ireland is on track to implement its budget for 2013, âalthough buffers with respect to the 7.5 per cent GDP deficit ceiling have narrowedâ. The report looks at the challenge facing countries that might take 10 years to achieve a primary surplus and then have to maintain it for 10 years in order to bring down debt relative to the size of the economy. It finds that Japan stands out as the country facing the most challenging task, followed closely by Ireland and Spain. The report says that after the downturn, the issue of sourcing more tax from top earners has emerged with renewed force. .

Ibec says jobs growth exceeds expectations in first half of year Ibec says jobs growth exceeds expectations in first half of year Business group lobbies Noonan not to increase excise, VAT or PRSI Fergal OâBrien of Ibec: âWe simply cannot afford to take more money out of the domestic economy.â Photograph: Eric Luke Employment growth exceeded expectations in the first half of 2013, according to a new jobs report by employersâ group Ibec. It says there were 8,259 new jobs announced in the past six months â with more than 2,100 announced in September â leading to an annual increase of 31 per cent. Private sector employment increased by 1.8 per cent over the past year, the report states. Employment growth The fastest employment growth was in agriculture, forestry and fishing, up 18.6 per cent, followed by the accommodation and food service activities sectors, up 8 per cent. According to the report, the overall manufacturing sector provided 33 per cent of all new jobs announced. However there remains a problem with long-term unemployment, which fell 12.3 per cent on an annual basis, but remains at nearly 60 per cent of total unemployment. The business group is lobbying Minister for Finance Michael Noonan ahead of next weekâs budget, imploring him not to increase excise, VAT or PRSI. Its head of policy and chief economist Fergal OâBrien said: âThe jobs recovery has been better than most expected, but unemployment remains at crisis level. âAny excise, VAT or PRSI increase will directly hit the number of new jobs next year. âWe simply cannot afford to take more money out of the domestic economy.â He said Irish excise rates were already among the highest in Europe and warned that any increase could potentially reignite cross-Border shopping. âThere is increasing evidence that further tax increases are likely to result in less revenue for the State, not more. Not delivered Last yearâs significant excise increase has not delivered the anticipated return. âThe Government has said the budget will be pro-growth and pro-jobs, but increasing indirect taxes like excise would damage employment in the drinks and hospitality sectors,â Mr OâBrien said. A reversal of the 9 per cent VAT rate to 13.5 per cent would cost 10,000 jobs in the economy and undo much of the employment recovery seen in that sector over the past year, he claimed.

Agreement would be a significant victory for the World Trade Organisation as a venue to draft the global rules of commerce. âThis is a landmark,â Anand Sharma, the Indian commerce minister, told the Financial Times in an interview. âToday we have taken a major step to correct the historical distortions,â he said, referring to the fact that the WTO now had much greater representation from developing countries than was the case during the Uruguay Round. âHistoric eventâ âIt looks as if tonight we have saved the WTO,â said Karel DeGucht, the EUâs trade commissioner. âThat would be a historic event.â The Bali deal would represent the first concrete progress in the so-called Doha Round of negotiations since they were launched in the Qatari capital in November 2001. It would also mark the first truly multilateral deal negotiated within the WTO since it was set up in 1995. However it includes only a small portion of the agenda that was chosen two years ago by ministers as deliverable. Jagdish Bhagwati, a trade economist, has called the Bali agenda âDoha lite and decaffeinatedâ. Senior trade officials said they expected to overcome objections to elements of the accord raised by Cuba and Venezuela. â
Injury doubts beset Wales squad Injury doubts beset Wales squad Wales have a clutch of injury worries before Wednesday's international friendly against Hungary in Cardiff. West Ham's Gavin Williams (ankle) looks certain to be out, so uncapped Wrexham defender Stephen Roberts is drafted in. Defenders Danny Gabbidon and Gareth Roberts, plus Ryan Giggs have hamstring concerns, while there are also doubts over Robbie Savage (groin). However, Manchester United winger Giggs is expected to recover in time to earn his 50th cap at the Millennium Stadium. There were also doubts over Gabbidon's fellow Cardiff defender Rhys Weston, but the full-back appears to have shrugged off the knock he picked up in the Bluebirds' 1-0 loss to West Ham on Sunday. The news leaves Wales boss John Toshack short in defence for his first game in charge, with Aston Villa's Mark Delaney injured and James Collins with the Under-21s. That could clear the way for new faces Danny Collins and Dave Partridge to make their Wales debuts. Coyne (Burnley), Jones (Wolves), Roberts (Wrexham), Collins (Sunderland), Edwards (Wolves), Gabbidon (Cardiff), Page (Cardiff), Partridge (Motherwell), Ricketts (Swansea), Roberts (Tranmere), Weston (Cardiff), Davies (Tottenham), Fletcher (West Ham), Giggs (Man Utd), Koumas (West Brom), Robinson (Sunderland), Savage (Blackburn), Williams (West Ham), Bellamy (Newcastle), Earnshaw (West Brom), Hartson (Celtic).

Irelandâs most âdynamicâ trading partners to include Argentina and Vietnam Irelandâs most âdynamicâ trading partners to include Argentina and Vietnam Merchandise exports are forecast to grow by 6 per cent a year between 2016 and 2030, gradually helping to strengthen the overall Irish economy. HSBC , in its new biannual Global Connections Trade Forecast, predicts that merchandise exports will start to grow from next year, taking off in 2016, with annual growth of 6 per cent forecast up to 2030. Alan Duffy, managing director and Ireland head with HSBC Corporate Banking, said recent economic reforms had further improved export competitiveness. âThis will help Irish firms to benefit from the improving conditions in the UK and the USA, as well as supporting Irish companies in gaining market share from other more stressed euro zone economies,â he said. Chemicals and pharmaceuticals will remain the main export sectors for Ireland, HSBC said in its new report, accounting for around 60 per cent of total merchandise exports. Return to results
Irish near top of OECD table for smoking and drinking Irish near top of OECD table for smoking and drinking Report finds Irish have greater propensity towards obesity than people in many other countries The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Developmentâs Health at a Glance 2013 report confirms the serious impact of the recession on health spending. Photograph: Fabrizio Bensch/Online News A major overview of health in Ireland published today shows that the Irish are still near the top of the international league table for smoking and drinking and have a greater propensity towards obesity than people in many other countries. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Developmentâs Health at a Glance 2013 report confirms the serious impact of the recession on health spending which had been growing in Ireland at 7 per cent annually during the boom years between 2000 and 2009. But it fell by 6.6 per cent annually between 2009 and 2011 on a per capita basis, with only Greece experiencing a sharper fall than Ireland. The report says that the fall in Irish spending reflects the substantial reforms undertaken, including cuts to cost of health care, such as wages and pharmaceuticals. Oecd health at a glance 2013 But the report also confirms the encouraging progress made in combating serious illnesses in the last two decades. Deaths due to cancer fell by 21 per cent, ischemic heart disease by 59 per cent and cerebrovascular disease by 54 per cent between 1990 and 2011. In all three instances, the rate of decline was greater than the OECD average. And life expectancy in Ireland has increased by a full four years since 2000 to reach 80.6 today, slightly more than the OECD average of 80.1. Ireland remains more than two years behind the table-topper, Switzerland, where life expectancy is 82.8 years. Drinking Ireland still ranks badly when it comes to smoking, drinking and obesity. Out of 40 countries surveyed, only the Russian Federation, Greece and Chile have a higher proportion of adult daily smokers than Irelandâs 29 per cent. And although this represents a decline of 12 percentage points since the year 2000, the decline is much smaller than in many other countries. However, this smoking data comes from 2007 and therefore may not give a completely accurate picture of current trends. Only five countries out of 40 drink more alcohol than Ireland annually on a per capita basis. Average consumption in Ireland has increased slightly in the last 20 years, compared to the significant reductions recorded in some high-consumption European countries, including France, Austria, Portugal and Spain. .

Latest jobless figures reflect uneven recovery in Europeâs powerhouse economy Latest jobless figures reflect uneven recovery in Europeâs powerhouse economy A man walks behind the labour office sign of an unemployment center in Munich. Photograph: Michaela Rehle/Online News German unemployment rose for a fourth month in November, signaling an uneven recovery in Europeâs largest economy. The number of people out of work climbed a seasonally- adjusted 10,000 to 2.985 million, after gaining by a revised 3,000 in October, the Nuremberg-based Federal Labour Agency said today. The adjusted jobless rate was unchanged at 6.9 per cent. Germany is relying more on its home economy as the euro area, its biggest export destination, struggles to sustain a nascent recovery. The countryâs third-quarter growth of 0.3 percent was entirely driven by domestic demand, led by capital investment and construction. Consumer confidence will rise next month to the highest level in more than six years, a survey by GfK SE showed yesterday. âGermanyâs economy is growing at a moderate pace in the fourth quarter and this is reflected in the number of unemployed,â said Andreas Moeller , analyst at WGZ Bank in Dusseldorf. âLow demand in other euro-zone economies is affecting exports in a moderate way, while income and investment are growing stronger.â Economists forecast that German gross domestic product will expand 0.4 per cent in the final three months of this year, twice as much as their prediction for the euro area. Chancellor Angela Merkelâs Christian Democratic bloc yesterday struck a deal with the Social Democrats to form a coalition government, more than two months after she won national elections. The agreement, which must be approved by the SPDâs membership, includes a national minimum wage and spending on pensions and infrastructure, while Dr Merkel held firm on her refusal to raise taxes.

Latest official figures show slight fall-off in suicide and self-harm rates Latest official figures show slight fall-off in suicide and self-harm rates Minister of State with responsibility for Mental Health Kathleen said deaths by suicide were a concern to everyone. Photograph: Eric Luke/Online News Young and middle-aged men remain most at risk from suicide in Ireland , the latest official figures show. The National Office for Suicide Preventionâs annual report indicates 495 people took their own lives in 2010, of which over 80 per cent were men. While the figure was lower than the previous two years, it remains higher than those recorded in the years prior to the economic recession. âThe latest confirmed figures for suicide by the Central Statistics Office for 2010 indicate that suicide rates in Ireland may be stabilising,â director of research at the National Suicide Research Foundation (NSRF), Professor Ella Arensman , said. However, she cautioned that the decrease in suicides coincided with an increase in deaths of âundetermined intentâ which may have included âhidden cases of suicidesâ. The report was one of three major reports on suicide and self-harm released today by the HSE. The annual report of the National Registry of Deliberate Self-Harmâs revealed there were 12,010 incidents of self-harm recorded in emergency departments last year, representing a 2 per cent decrease on the previous year. However, the self-harm rate were still 12 per cent higher than that recorded prior the downturn. According to the registry, women aged in their late teens and men in their early 20s were most likely to hurt themselves. The most common method used in self-harm, accounting for 69 per cent of all cases, involved an overdose of medication, with women being overrepresented, the report. A separate report by the Suicide Support and Information System (SSIS) recorded incidences of two suicide death clusters in 2011 in Co Cork, with 13 in one 23km radius over three months, and seven over two months in a 28km area. Minister of State with responsibility for Mental Health Kathleen said deaths by suicide were a concern to everyone. âWe have all been made aware of suicide a some stage in our lives, whether it was a family member, friend or a member of our community,â she said. âThe challenge of reducing suicide rates demands a very comprehensive and multi-layered response, with interventions at different levels and involving a range of stakeholders.â Return to results
McClaren eyes Uefa Cup top spot McClaren eyes Uefa Cup top spot Steve McClaren wants his Middlesbrough team to win their Uefa Cup group by beating Partizan Belgrade. Boro have already qualified for the knockout stages alongside Partizan and Villareal, at the expense of Lazio. But boss McClaren is looking for a victory which would mean they avoid a team that has played in the Champions League in Friday's third-round draw. "To need a win to finish top is fantastic, but it is going to be a tough one," McClaren said. "When the draw was made, I thought it was the toughest group of them all - and so it has proved. "Lazio were favourites, Villarreal have been semi-finalists, and Partizan have fantastic experience in Europe. "The pleasing thing is we did the business in the first two games. "Winning those two has put us in a great position and it has been a fantastic experience playing these teams." Comments are closed for this article.
Microsoft sets sights on spyware Microsoft sets sights on spyware Windows users could soon be paying Microsoft to keep PCs free of spyware. Following the takeover of anti-spyware firm Giant, Microsoft said it would soon release a toolkit that strips machines of the irritating programs. Although initially free, Microsoft has not ruled out charging people who want to keep this toolkit up to date. Surveys show that almost every Windows PC is infested with spyware programs that do everything from bombard users with adverts to steal login data. Microsoft said that a beta version of the toolkit to clean up Windows machines should be available within 30 days. Designed for PCs running Windows 2000 and XP, the utility will clean out spyware programs, constantly monitor what happens on a PC and will be regularly updated to catch the latest variants. Before now many of Microsoft's other security boosting programs, such as the firewall in Windows XP, have been given away free. But Mike Nash, vice president in Microsoft's security business unit, said it was still working out pricing and licensing issues. Charging for future versions has not been discounted, he said. "We'll come up with a plan and roll that out," he said. The plan could turn out to be a lucrative one for Microsoft. A recent survey by Earthlink and Webroot found that 90% of PCs are infested with the surreptitious software and that, on average, each one is harbouring 28 separate spyware programs. Currently users wanting protection from spyware have turned to free programs such as Spybot and Ad-Aware. Spyware comes in many forms and at its most benign exploits lazy browsing habits to install itself and subject users to unwanted adverts. Other forms hijack net browser settings to force people to view pages they would otherwise never visit. At its most malign, spyware watches everything that people do with their PC and steals login information and other personal data. Microsoft's announcement about spyware comes after it bought small New York software firm Giant Company Software. Terms of the acquisition were not disclosed. Comments are closed for this article.
Millions buy MP3 players in US Millions buy MP3 players in US One in 10 adult Americans - equivalent to 22 million people - owns an MP3 player, according to a survey. A study by the Pew Internet and American Life Project found that MP3 players are the gadget of choice among affluent young Americans. The survey did not interview teenagers but it is likely that millions of under-18s also have MP3 players. The American love affair with digital music players has been made possible as more and more homes get broadband. Of the 22 million Americans who own MP3 players, 59% are men compared to 41% of women. Those on high income - judged to be $75,000 (Â£39,000) or above - are four times more likely to have players than those earning less than $30, 000 ( Â£15,000). Broadband access plays a big part in ownership too. Almost a quarter of those with broadband at home have players, compared to 9% of those who have dial-up access. MP3 players are still the gadget of choice for younger adults. Almost one in five US citizens aged under 30 have one. This compares to 14% of those aged 30-39 and 14% of those aged 40-48. The influence of children also plays a part. Sixteen percent of parents living with children under 18 have digital players compared to 9% of those who don't. The ease of use and growth of music available on the net are the main factors for the upsurge in ownership, the survey found. People are beginning to use them as instruments of social activity - sharing songs and taking part in podcasting - the survey found. "IPods and MP3 players are becoming a mainstream technology for consumers" said Lee Rainie, director of the Pew Internet and American Life Project. "More growth in the market is inevitable as new devices become available, as new players enter the market, and as new social uses for iPods/MP3 players become popular," he added. Return to results
Minister for Social Protection says revelations about CRC âextremely disturbingâ Minister for Social Protection says revelations about CRC âextremely disturbingâ The clinicâs fundraising literature states that although it is largely State-funded, it has a âsignificant annual shortfall which must be made up through voluntary donations and fundraisingâ. Steven Carroll, Pamela Duncan Charitable donations should not be used to fund âlavish salariesâ, Minister for Social Protection Joan Burton has said. Speaking at the Labour Party National Conference in Killarney tonight, Ms Burton said revelations about the use of donated funds to top-up salaries at the Central Remedial Clinic were âextremely disturbingâ. She said it was âvery importantâ that the organisation came out and clarified the issues that have been disclosed so far. Ms Burton said the CRC needed to provide details of its fundraising and additional sources of income and explain how that money is spent. âWhat happens after that depends on what they have to tell us,â she said. âI think they need to produce full accounting details and records and information in relation to it. Where it is inappropriate I would hope to see them change or modify that practice.â The organisation yesterday admitted that money raised by a charitable company had been used to top up the salaries of staff including its former chief executive. Five senior staff at the Central Remedial Clinic (CRC) are still in receipt of top-up payments. The organisationâs then chief executive Paul Kiely, who was on a State salary of â¬106,900 prior to his retirement, received a further â¬136,000 supplemented by the clinic. Ms Burton said the public needed assurances that their generous donations to charities were being used for the purpose they hoped when selecting a charity to give money to. This was particularly important in the lead up to Christmas, which was an important fundraising period, she added. âIâm sure there is a huge amount of concern about the revelations because charity donations are not meant to fund lavish salaries way in excess of what the Taoiseach of the country is earning.â The Taoiseach receives a salary of â¬185,350 annually. Earlier, Fundraising Ireland , an umbrella organisation for professional fundraisers including a number of well-known Irish charities, said its membersâ were reporting people cancelling their charitable donations as a result of the top up revelations. Chief executive Anne Hanniffy said the revelations were having a âdisproportionate and unfair impact on the funding efforts of charities and critically, people reliantâ on such charities âThis is concerning for hard-pressed organisations so openly reliant on public generosity and support,â she said. âIt is doubly concerning when the source of peopleâs frustration is an issue which has absolutely nothing to do with the way in which the vast majority of high quality not-for-profit organisations are funded and operated.â She said Fundraising Ireland believed transparency, accountability and regulation were vital to any healthy institution: âWe owe it to donors that their money goes where they expect it to go,â she said. .

Mourinho takes swipe at Arsenal Mourinho takes swipe at Arsenal Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho has attempted to pile the pressure on title rivals Arsenal ahead of the Gunners facing Newcastle on Wednesday. Arsenal will play the Magpies a day after Chelsea beat Portsmouth during a busy festive programme. And Mourinho said: "They always seem to have two or three days' rest in which to recover. Perhaps it's something to do with the television schedule. "All my players are tired, especially John Terry." Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho admitted his side were "lucky" to win at Fratton Park but is still unhappy with the amount of games in such a short space of time during this time of year. He added: "We have had to play two matches in three days which is foreign to many of my players and, although I understand the traditions of football here at this time of year, it is not good for your health to do it. "You can sit back and smoke cigars, one after another, and it is a good life, but it is not actually good for you. "Playing so many games is certainly not healthy, especially for teams who still have European commitment." Return to results
Movie body targets children's PCs Movie body targets children's PCs The body that represents the US movie industry has released its latest tool in its campaign to clamp down on movie file-sharing, aimed at parents. The Movie Association for America's (MPAA) free Parent File Scan software lets parents check their children's computers for peer-to-peer programs. It will also list all movie and music files they have on their hard drive. Parents then have the choice to remove programs and files. The MPAA said files found would not be passed on to it. "Our ultimate goal is to help consumers locate the resources and information they need to make appropriate decisions about using and trading illegal files," said Dan Glickman, MPAA chief. "Many parents are concerned about what their children have downloaded and where they've downloaded it from." But some computer users who had tested the latest software reported on some technology sites that the program had identified Windows default wav files as copyrighted material and wanted to delete them. Movie piracy cost the industry Â£3.7bn ($7bn) in 2003, according to analysts. The MPAA said in a statement that it would continue to provide easy access to similar tools in the coming months to combat "the deleterious effects of peer-to-peer software, including such common problems as viruses, Trojan horses and identity theft". Mr Glickman said that the film industry was embracing "digital age technologies", like Movielink and CinemaNow, which are legal movie sites. "But legal services such as these need a chance to grow and thrive without having to compete against illegitimate operations that depend on stolen property to survive," he added. The industry body also said it had launched a second round of legal action against online movie-swappers across the US, but did not say how many were being sued. Its first set of lawsuits were filed in November 2004. It also started a campaign against operators of BitTorrent, eDonkey and DirectConnect peer-to-peer networks. The first convictions for peer-to-peer piracy were handed out in the US in January. William Trowbridge and Michael Chicoine pleaded guilty to charges that they infringed copyright by illegally sharing music, movies and software. Return to results
National backstops expected to be in place for European banking stress tests - Draghi National backstops expected to be in place for European banking stress tests - Draghi European Central Bank president Mario Draghi said he expected no disasters to come to light in forthcoming financial health checks on the regionâs banks, which would be rigorous. Photograph: John Schults/Online News National backstops are expected to be in place to deal with capital holes that might be uncovered by next yearâs European bank stress tests, the head of the European Central Bank indicated yesterday. Mario Draghiâs comments underline expectations it will fall to states to decide how to deal with any losses that arise when banksâ balance sheets are investigated next year, despite last yearâs pledge to sever the link between sovereign and banking debt. Speaking in Paris after the ECBâs monthly rate-setting meeting, at which interest rates were left at a record low of 0.5 per cent, Mr Draghi noted that an explicit reference to national backstops had been included in the conclusions to the last EU summit. âAstonishedâ by doubts He said he was âastonishedâ that doubts had been expressed about whether national backstops will be in place by the time the ECB assumes supervisory control of the banks next year. He added that EU commissioner Olli Rehn had reiterated that any capital injections by states would be regarded as a âonce-offâ measure and would not be counted by the European Commission when it calculates countriesâ excessive deficit targets. However, capital injection by states into the banking system are likely to significantly add to the debt pile of individual countries. Mr Draghi said he did not expect âmajor disastersâ from the tests, but added it was âquite important that full light be shed and full transparency be thereâ. By the end of this month, the ECB will unveil its plans on how it plans to approach asset-quality reviews of 130 euro zone banks. The reviews will be followed by separate European Banking Authority stress tests later in the year. Bailout exit The bank announced this week that Oliver Wyman , the consultancy firm that gave Anglo Irish Bank a clean bill of health in 2006, will aid with the process, though national supervisors will have a key role. The Central Bank of Ireland is undertaking its own balance sheet assessment in preparation for the exit from the bailout, though these will not be published separately and are likely to feed into the European tests. After the rate-setting meeting in Paris, Mr Draghi reiterated that the ECB would be ready to launch another long-term refinancing operation for Europeâs financial system.

Nationwide rent prices on the rise Nationwide rent prices on the rise Rents for homes in Dublin have increased 7.6 per cent in past year Ronan Lyons: said an acute shortage of rental accommodation has emerged in Dublin Rents for homes in Dublin have increased by 7.6 per cent in the past year, contributing to a countrywide jump of more than 4 per cent, according to the latest Daft.ie rental report. The report shows average rent prices across the country accelerated to 4.8 per cent in the third quarter of this year, mainly due to trends outside Dublin. Rental costs outside the capital increased from 0.9 per cent to 1.8 per cent in recent months. In Cork and Galway cities, rental inflation is between 3 per cent and 4 per cent, while in Limerick, rents are 1.8 per cent higher, the first annual increase in rents since late 2007. Outside the cities, rents rose by 2.7 per cent in Leinster and 0.9 per cent in Connacht-Ulster but were static in Munster. In Dublin, rents were 7.6 per cent higher than a year previously as a result of very tight supply, with fewer than 1,500 properties available to rent on November 1st, compared to more than 6,700 on the same date four years ago. TCD economist Ronan Lyons , who was the author of the Daft report, said an acute shortage of rental accommodation has now emerged in Dublin, with fewer properties on the market now that at any point since records started in January 2006. âClearly, any Nama supply in the capital would be a welcome addition in easing tenant concerns.â Return to results
New delay hits EU software laws New delay hits EU software laws A fresh delay has hit controversial new European Union rules which govern computer-based inventions. The draft law was not adopted by EU ministers as planned at a Brussels meeting on Monday during which it was supposed to have been discussed. The fresh delay came after Polish officials had raised concerns about the law for the second time in two months. Critics say the law would favour large companies over small ones and could impact open-source software innovation. "There was at one point the intention to put the item on today's agenda. But in the end we could not put it on," an EU spokesman told the Online News agency. He added that no date had been chosen for more discussion of the law. In December, Poland requested more time to consider the issue because it was concerned that the law could lead to the patenting of pure computer software. Its ministers want to see the phrasing of the text of the Directive on the Patentability of Computer-Implemented Inventions changed so that it excludes software patenting. Poland is a large EU member, so its backing for the legislation is vital. The EU says the law would bring Europe more in line with how such laws work in the US, but this has caused some angry debate amongst critics and supporters. In the US, the patenting of computer programs and internet business methods is permitted. This means that the US-based Amazon.com holds a patent for its "one-click shopping" service. Critics say a similar model in Europe would hurt small software developers which do not have the legal and financial might of larger companies. But supporters say current law does not let big companies protect inventions which they have spent years developing. Return to results
No lack of Christmas spirit No lack of Christmas spirit It's that time of year when footballers and managers brace themselves for what I think is the most important period of the entire season. I was thinking to myself last week that the last time I had a Christmas off was 39 years ago. I have never been out of work at Christmas as a player or manager since I was 17 when our youth team coach at Chesterfield, a chap called Reg Wright, gave us Christmans off. But only because there were no games. I think things have changed dramatically over the years in terms of discipline and looking after themselves. Players take a lot more responsibility these days, in particular the older ones - I'm talking about those 32 and over, here. They've changed their whole outlook in order to continue playing at this level. Managers as well need to trust players more than we have in the past. In my squad I haven't got anyone I have to warn regarding excess and over-eating, which is a massive bonus. Over the years, there have been some players in the squad who you would never know if they were going to turn up for training smelling of booze. As per usual, we will be training on Christmas Day, prior to our Boxing Day trip to Coventry. But there are times when you can do too much over Christmas, having the players in for training and then leaving for the game. I'll try and strike a balance and after we've trained in the morning, the players can go home for a few hours and we'll leave for Coventry about 7pm. I allow the players to have a pre-Christmas night out. They came to me in November and asked if they could have a night out in Leeds and I said 'no'. I also said 'no' to Manchester, Sheffield and Nottingham and eventually let them go to Dublin after we played at Millwall. I send a minder with them to look after them, not because I don't trust them. The problem is that nowadays, footballers are big news and you never know when somebody is going to step out with a mobile phone and take pictures of them. You have to trust your players to behave themselves, but unfortunately you can't govern for other people's behaviour. There is always an idiot out there who wants to get himself a bit notoriety or his name in the local paper by picking a fight and taking a pop at a professional footballer. I also know that last year one newspaper asked certain young ladies to find out when and where players were holding their Christmas parties in the hope of getting embarrassing photos. I tried to behave myself as a player and I remember when I was at Scunthorpe, going to bed at 10pm on New Year's Eve as we had a game on New Year's Day. I missed all the festivities and seeing the new year in, only to wake up the next morning to find there was two feet of snow on the ground! We all love Christmas, though and I like to take my children William and Amy to see the lights and take them to Santa's grotto. But when you're in football you accept that Christmas is not the same for you as for others. In fact, until somebody mentioned it to me the other day, I never realised that it's become the norm for me and others in football not to have a Christmas holiday. One of the nice things when I do retire will be not having to worry about the phone ringing over Christmas. You're always on tenterhooks on Christmas Day that somebody is injured or has had an accident playing with their kids. But I would like to take this opportunity to wish everybody a Happy Christmas and a prosperous new year. Comments are closed for this article.
Noonan admits bailout exit decision was âfinely balancedâ Noonan admits bailout exit decision was âfinely balancedâ Minister for Finance speaking in DÃ¡il ahead of a vote on Governmentâs go it alone strategy Minister for Finance Michael Noonan was addressing the DÃ¡il ahead of a vote on the Governmentâs bailout exit policy this evening. Photograph: Frank Miller/Online News Minister for Finance Michael Noonan said today the decision to exit the bailout programme without a backstop was a âfinely balancedâ one. However, he insisted it was âthe right decisionâ for the country and âthe right timeâ to make the decision. The Minister was addressing the DÃ¡il ahead of a vote on the Governmentâs bailout exit policy later this evening. Mr Noonan said the muted market reaction to the announcement illustrated the marketâs view that the Governmentâs decision was both correct and timely. He said confidence in Ireland had improved considerably in recent months, noting that yields on Irish Government bonds were now at record lows. âInterestingly, our yields are now lower than the yields for some of the Eurozone countries that would have had to approve a precautionary credit line for us.â Mr Noonan also noted that the country now had substantial cash reserves estimated to be in excess of â¬20 billion by the end of the year, which would âact as a domestic backstopâ. âWe have lived up to our programme commitments, we have stabilised public finances and introduced frameworks for economic management supported by independent oversight.â âWhile there are challenges and risks, we are confident that over the past three years we have demonstrated a strong track record of managing the programme and of ensuring that we are now normalising the economic and financial situation into the future.â Mr Noonan said Taoiseach Enda Kenny had held discussions with German chancellor Angela Merkel on finding ways to reinforce economic recovery here by improving funding mechanisms for the real economy, including access to finance for SMEs. As part of this, the German government had asked KfW, the German development bank, to work with the German and Irish authorities, he said. Mr Noonan said his department had exchanged working papers with German officials on how the bank would assist Ireland with development funds. He also said discussions with Irish officials and officials from Germany were held yesterday. .

Photograph: Francois Lenoir /Online News Minister for Finance Michael Noonan said he hopes Moodyâs rating agency will raise the Irelandâs credit rating from non-investment grade as the country exits its bailout program and plans debt sales. âWeâre hopeful that Moodyâs will have another look at us early in the New Year,â Mr Noonan said in an interview with Online News Television in London. âThe mood from all the rating agencies is positive at present.â Moodyâs, which gave Ireland its top Aaa grade in 1998 before the euro was introduced, cut its rating on the nation to non-investment grade, or junk, in July 2011 following the financial collapse. âMoodyâs difficulty seems to be with the European Union and the euro zone, rather than with Ireland specifically,â Mr Noonan said. âThatâs what theyâve told us.â A junk rating cuts out some money managers, whose investment criteria stop them buying low-rated securities. Standard and Poorâs and Fitch Ratings, rank Ireland at BBB+, three levels above non-investment grade. The yield on Irelandâs 10-year bonds was little changed at 3.56 per cent today, leaving the yield difference, or spread, over similar-maturity German bunds at 1.70 percentage points. âWe decided to exit the bailout and do it cleanly without any precautionary programs or any dedicated credit lines. Weâre not jumping out of the plane without a parachute. We have cash buffers in excess of â¬20 billion. That funds up to the second quarter of 2015 if we never entered the market.â The sale of â¬1.3 billion worth of Bank of Ireland preference shares by the Government earlier this weem was beyond his expectactions, he said. âA lot of people want to buy our paper. Weâre not junk, weâre doing fine,â he said. He also said there is no evidence that the countryâs lenders need more capital. Mr Noonan indicated heâll âtake time and seeâ what to do with the Stateâs 99.9 per cent stake in Allied Irish Bank, which is probably worth between â¬5 billion and â¬7 billion. He said he was still âhopefulâ on the Governmentâs campaign to win retroactive recapitalisation of the banking system. Online News Comments are closed for this article.
OECD figure defends corporation tax rate OECD figure defends corporation tax rate Pascal Saint-Amans, director of the Centre for Tax Policy and Administration at the OECD, defended Irelandâs right to set its own corporation tax rate. Photograph: Julien Behal/Maxwells Mark Hilliard Minister for Finance Michael Noonan has said the changes to company residence rules that he is introducing as part of Budget 2014 will not âput an end to international tax planningâ by large corporates but was âthe right thing for Ireland to do nowâ. Mr Noonan was speaking at the Irish Tax Institute/ Harvard Kennedy School global tax policy conference last night at Dublin Castle. He said the changes were aimed at eliminating the âmismatch that can exist between tax treaty partners so that in certain circumstances a company can end up being stateless in terms of their place of tax residencyâ. The Minister said âmultilateral action from many countries working together in common purposeâ was needed to put an end to this practice. Mr Noonan said Ireland had not been asked to make the changes and the country was playing its part through the EU and the OECD base erosion and profit shifting project in addressing issues about international tax planning by multinational companies. âI believe making this change now will provide global investors with clarity and confidence in our commitment to protect Irelandâs international standing and reputation,â he added. Meanwhile, a leading figure on international taxation policy has defended Irelandâs right to set its own corporation tax rate and said the country does not operate an opaque system. Matter of sovereignty Pascal Saint-Amans, director of the Centre for Tax Policy and Administration at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), said the 12.5 per cent rate was a matter of the countryâs sovereignty. Mr Saint-Amans welcomed the Governmentâs recent publication outlining Irelandâs international tax strategy. Earlier this year Ireland attracted particular criticism from US law makers due to the level of tax paid out by an Irish subsidiary of Apple . âI think Ireland is a very open economy and does play by the rules,â Mr Saint-Amans said. In relation to a broader global culture of banking secrecy surrounding tax payments by companies, he said this had been addressed. âWe have completely changed that environment. We now are at a juncture where exchange of information is the rule and bank secrecy for tax purposes is no longer acceptable. And Ireland has played a key role. âIreland has always been keen on transparency; there is no such thing as an opaque system in Ireland.â Earlier this year the OECD reported to the G20 on the issue of base erosion and profit shifting, the legacy of which has been manifest in controversies involving multinationals paying little in tax despite reaping considerable profits. âSocial contractâ OECD policy is directed toward the elimination of both double taxation and double non-taxation, arising out of companies basing themselves across jurisdictions and ultimately taking advantage of a complex web of tax laws. âI think the Irish people have made it clear that they are a sovereign people and 12.5 per cent is part of that social contract and itâs part of your sovereignty,â he said. Meanwhile, the secretary general at the Department of Finance John Moran , outlined the Governmentâs belief that restructuring the âhugely flawedâ tax system in Ireland was key to sustaining economic growth as well as to revenue raising.

OECD rates China as faring best among emerging economies OECD rates China as faring best among emerging economies Sold on gold: buying accessories in Taiyuan, Shanxi province â the OECD predicts that a âsmall fiscal stimulusâ will revive Chinese domestic demand and help push the countryâs GDP growth from 7.7 per cent this year to 8.2 per cent in 2014. photograph: jon woo/reuters In the latest economic forecasts from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, China fared best among emerging-market economies as it adjusts policy to confront a changing global outlook. Chinese GDP will rise 7.7 per cent this year and 8.2 per cent in 2014 as a âsmall fiscal stimulusâ revives domestic demand, the Paris-based OECD said in its semi-annual report, driven by stronger domestic demand. âGrowth is picking up and inflation remains low, domestic demand has led the turnaround,â it said. However, the OECD said Beijing needed to speed up the process of structural reforms to help boost domestic consumption, as economic expansion still relies heavily on investment. âWith the economy recovering, there is now a favourable window to push forward with structural reform, in particular financial liberalisation, encouraging labour mobility and tax reform,â the OECD said. The OECD welcomed the recent reform plan, but did warn that certain reforms may have some short-term negative impact on the economy. And the OECD also sees downside risks in Chinaâs public debt problem, which lingers from Chinaâs massive stimulus programme during the global financial crisis in 2008-2009. âThere are also downside risks, notably stemming from local public debt. Mishandled defaults, were they to occur, might jeopardise the health of the banking system and confidence in capital markets,â it added. OECD chief economist Pier Carlo Padoan said in an interview with Online News : âWhat sets China apart is that it has been growing because of structural change as the government addressed the economyâs weaknesses quickly. Itâs becoming more and more of a middle-income country.â The OECD predicted Chinaâs consumer inflation will ease to 2.4 per cent in 2014 from 2.5 per cent this year. The volume of Chinaâs exports of goods and services will grow 6.8 per cent in 2014, easing from 8.8 per cent this year, while import growth could slow to 9.2 per cent from 9.8 per cent. Expansion in India Elsewhere, the OECD sees Indiaâs economy expanding 3.4 per cent this year and 5.1 per cent in 2014, down from 5.7 per cent and 6.6 per cent previously. âMost of the emerging economies have underlying fragilities that mean they cannot continue growing as they used to,â said Padoan. âThey used to be an important support engine for global growth in bad times. Now the reverse is true and advanced economies canât be said to be in very good times again.â
Over half of homes valued below â¬150,000 for property tax Over half of homes valued below â¬150,000 for property tax Just 0.2 per cent of home-owners say their property worth more than â¬1 million The latest property tax statistics show 24.9 per cent of people said their property was valued at less than â¬100,000. More than half of Irelandâs homeowners have told the Revenue Commissioners their house or apartment is worth less than â¬150,000 for the purposes of the local property tax. The latest property tax statistics show 24.9 per cent of people said their property was valued at less than â¬100,000 while 28.6 per cent said their property was worth between â¬100,001 and â¬150,000. Just 0.2 per cent of the population said their property was worth more than â¬1 million. There are in excess of 25,000 claims for exemption from returned property tax assessments, with over 1,000 property owners seeking exemption due to pyrite damages. Louth and Donegal have the lowest compliance rates at 84 per cent, while DÃºn Laoghaire-Rathdown in South Co Dublin has the highest compliance rate at 92 per cent. The statistics show more than â¬200 million has been collected by the end of September, with the overall property tax compliance rate now at 90 per cent. In a further breakdown of the property tax regime, the Revenue also gave details on exemptions. Some 4.7 per cent of homes have been classed as pyrite damaged; 4.3 per cent are owned by a person who is severely incapacitated; 16.1 per cent are classed as being in ghost estates; and another 17.1 per cent are lying empty after a developer failed to get a buyer. Another 15 per cent are classed as long-term illness and 0.1 per cent are diplomatic buildings. Most people who have paid the tax have used a credit or debit card while almost one third paid by cheque, or an equivalent. Comments are closed for this article.
Owen dismisses fresh Real rumours Owen dismisses fresh Real rumours England striker Michael Owen helped inspire Real Madrid to a 2-1 win at Osasuna in La Liga on Sunday before insisting he is happy at the club. The ex-Liverpool player started on the bench, an on-going situation that has led to rumours of a Premiership return. Owen has admitted he is frustrated at his lack of first-team chances but is determined to succeed in Spain. "I'm always going to say I want to play more minutes but that doesn't mean I'm unhappy being a substitute," he said. "It wasn't a great goal, but neither was the game, grounds like this are always difficult," Owen added. "I'm happy with my goal because it was a vital goal for the win and even more so after what Barcelona did (beating Real Zaragoza 4-1 on Saturday). "This could be a decisive result at the end of the season. "Even when we were losing, I was confident we could win and now we all have very positive feelings." Roberto Carlos' free-kick was parried and when Raul's shot was kept out Owen was in the right place to head home. Ivan Helguera scored the winner for Real, who have won seven games in a row under new coach Vanderlei Luxemburgo. The victory kept them within four points of leaders Barcelona. Owen had earlier hinted in the News of the World newspaper that he may leave Real Madrid to safeguard his international career. He has failed to command a regular place in the Real team and said he is concerned that his increasing amount of time on the bench may affect his England place. "Sometimes I feel I am happy then the next week I might be on the bench and I am a bit low in myself again," he told The News of The World. "It is frustrating and isn't the best way to prepare for the next World Cup." Owen has had to prove himself to three managers in his short time at Real. Jose Antonio Camacho was replaced by Mariano Garcia Remon, who has now made way for Luxemburgo. "The first manager came along and I never started that much. But the more he was here the more I played," the striker said. "Then the second manager came and he went back to the normal 11 that everyone associated with. "But I had eight or nine games on the spin and scored seven goals on the bounce. I was doing all right and then he left and now I am back to where I was again. "It has not been ideal but it looks as if this manager is here to stay so I will keep plugging away." Owen has discussed his concerns with England coach Sven-Goran Eriksson and admitted: "This last month hasn't been perfect. I am not missing out on goalscoring but I am missing out on minutes on the pitch." Luxemburgo told the Sunday Times that he sympathised with Owen. "He is bound to get angry and feel sad but I can say Owen will play more," he commented. "Raul and Ronaldo are not always going to start every game. "I like Owen a lot in training, he is always willing, ready to listen to things. He is a bit introverted but he has got character." Meanwhile, Luxemburgo has booked himself a place in the Real history books after the victory over Osasuna. He is the first coach to have won his first seven league games in charge of the club.

Palace threat over Cantona masks Palace threat over Cantona masks Manchester United fans wearing Eric Cantona masks will not be allowed in Selhurst Park on Saturday. United fans are planning to mark the 10th anniversary of Cantona's infamous kung-fu kick on Crystal Palace fan Matthew Simmons by wearing the masks. But Palace stadium manager Kevin Corner has warned: "If they wear them inside Selhurst Park they will be immediately rejected on safety grounds. "And no fans wearing Cantona masks will be allowed entry to the stadium." United fans had declared Saturday as 'Cantona Day' and had planned to wear masks, that were popular during the Frenchman's time as a player at the Old Trafford club. Cantona received a nine-month ban following the incident and Palace are keen to avoid an incident that would stir up ill feeling between the two sets of supporters. Four months after the Cantona incident a Palace fan, Paul Nixon, was killed prior to an FA Cup semi-final at Villa Park. Return to results
Pearce keen on succeeding Keegan Pearce keen on succeeding Keegan Joint assistant boss Stuart Pearce has admitted he would like to succeed Kevin Keegan as manager at Manchester City. Keegan has decided to step down as City manager when his contract comes to an end in 18 months. "You don't have to be Einstein to realise there will be a manager's job available at a really good club," Pearce told Online News GMR. "I will certainly be applying for it, although whether the board deem me good enough to take it, I do not know." Pearce initially joined City as a player under Keegan in 2001 before becoming part of the coaching staff. He was promoted to joint assistant-manager following the departure of Arthur Cox last summer. The former England defender had a year as player-boss with Nottingham Forest eight seasons ago but has made no secret of his desire to have another crack at the job. He was linked with the manager's job at Oldham and Keegan has stated he would not get in the way if Pearce wanted to leave. But it now appears Pearce is keen to wait for his chance at City. He added: "By that time, I will have been here for five years so at least they will have had a good look at me and they are aware of my feelings with regard to being Kevin's successor. "Obviously, the issue is out of my hands but it is a fantastic job for anybody - I just hope it will be me." Comments are closed for this article.
People gather in Galway, Cork to mark Savita anniversary People gather in Galway, Cork to mark Savita anniversary Candlelit vigils mark year since death of Indian woman at Galway hospital Candles are lit by the public at the vigil at Eyre Square in Galway city last evening to mark the first anniversary of the death of Savita Halappanavar.

Photograph: Niall Carson/PA Previous Image Next Image Previous Images More Images About 100 people braved the cold and wet conditions in Eyre Square, Galway yesterday evening to pay their respects to Savita Halappanavar on the first anniversary of her death. They staged a candlelight vigil in memory of the Indian dentist who had moved to Galway with her husband but who died at University College Hospital last year a few days after presenting with signs of miscarriage. Her husband Praveen did not attend the vigil and spent the anniversary with friends. The Mayor of Galway, Cllr Padraig Conneely , attended and said that Savita would always be remembered in Galway. âThis is the city Savita had lived in, both she and her husband had made their homes here and it is important that we donât forget her,â he said. Show support Most of the people who gathered to honour her had never met her, but wanted to show their support. They lit candles around a photograph of Savita, and listened while a performer sang Nancy Spain, ending it with the words: âSavita, we will never forget your name.â A good friend of Savitaâs, Sunil Koppuri , said that friends and members of the Indian community in Galway were still trying to come to terms with her death. âIt is difficult today but we are always thinking of Savita. It is not easy, sometimes it feels like she is not gone but then we know it is true. We came today to remember our friend,â he said. Another close friend, Vishali Valluri, said Savita was an incalculable loss to all who knew her. âI still think she canât be gone. She was my very good friend and I miss her every day. We thought she would make it, I never thought she would die. Itâs still very hard every day but especially today,â she said. Cork vigil A separate vigil outside Cork Opera House was attended by more than 40 people. Maureen Considine , co-founder of Cork Feminista, who handed out candles at the vigil, said the passing of Savita had had a profound impact on Irish society. âWhen the first vigil was organised last year I turned to my partner and said âWe are going.â I felt that what happened to Savita could have happened to any of us.â Ms Considine described Praveen Halappanavar as an âamazing manâ. âHe has made the effort to continue to speak about this publicly at a time of great difficulty. He has been a profound gift to us all. This vigil is about remembering Savita and honoring the Halappanavar family. We want to show solidarity with them.â Joe Moore said Savita lost her life in a shocking and senseless manner. âPraveen has shown such strength and courage over the last 12 months.â Return to results
PlayStation 3 processor unveiled PlayStation 3 processor unveiled The Cell processor, which will drive Sony's PlayStation 3, will run 10-times faster than current PC chips, its designers have said. Sony, IBM and Toshiba, who have been working on the Cell processor for three years, unveiled the chip on Monday. It is being designed for use in graphics workstations, the new PlayStation console, and has been described as a supercomputer on a chip. The chip will run at speeds of greater than 4 GHz, the firms said. By comparison, rival chip maker Intel's fastest processor runs at 3.8 GHz. Details of the chip were released at the International Solid State Circuits Conference in San Francisco. The new processor is set to ignite a fresh battle between Intel and the Cell consortium over which processor sits at the centre of digital products. The PlayStation 3 is expected in 2006, while Toshiba plans to incorporate it into high-end televisions next year. IBM has said it will sell a workstation with the chip starting later this year. Cell is comprised of several computing engines, or cores. A core based on IBM's Power architecture controls eight "synergistic" processing centres. In all, they can simultaneously carry out 10 instruction sequences, compared with two for current Intel chips. Later this year, Intel and Advanced Micro Devices plan to release their own "multicore" chips, which also increase the number of instructions that can be executed at once. The Cell's specifications suggest the PlayStation 3 will offer a significant boost in graphics capabilities but analysts cautioned that not all the features in a product announcement will find their way into systems. "Any new technology like this has two components," said Steve Kleynhans, an analyst with Meta Group. He said: "It has the vision of what it could be because you need the big vision to sell it. "Then there's the reality of how it's really going to be used, which generally is several levels down the chain from there." While the PlayStation 3 is likely to be the first mass-market product to use Cell, the chip's designers have said the flexible architecture means that it would be useful for a wide range of applications, from servers to mobile phones. Initial devices are unlikely to be any smaller than a games console, however, because the first version of the Cell will run hot enough to need a cooling fan. And while marketing speak describes the chip as a "supercomputer" - it remains significantly slower than the slowest computer on the list of the world's top 500 supercomputers. IBM said Cell was "OS neutral" and would support multiple operating systems simultaneously but designers would not confirm if Microsoft's Windows was among those tested with the chip. If Cell is to challenge Intel's range of chips in the marketplace, it will need to find itself inside PCs, which predominantly run using Windows. Return to results
Pre-eclampsia is the current leading cause of maternal death in Europe. Pre-eclampsia is the current leading cause of maternal death in Europe. Photograph: Katie Collins/PA Wire A major Irish-led research programme that aims to revolutionise maternal and foetal healthcare through a significantly more personalised treatment approach has just been launched. The EU-funded initiative focuses on the life-threatening complications associated with pre-eclampsia, a common late-stage pregnancy condition. The IMPROvED (IMproved PRegnancy Outcomes by Early Detection) project involves the use of novel biomarkers to develop a simple, sensitive blood test for pre-eclampsia. The international consortium of obstetric clinicians and scientists involved in the project is led by Louise Kenny , professor of obstetrics, University College Cork , director of the Irish Centre for Foetal and Neonatal Translational Research (Infant), Cork and consultant obstetrician and gynaecologist, University Maternity Hospital. The study will be conducted with the help and participation of first-time pregnant women recruited in major obstetric centres across five European countries. Pre-eclampsia is the current leading cause of maternal death in Europe and the cause of 70,000-80,000 maternal deaths worldwide annually (and more than 500,000 infant deaths). âExcellent handsâ Prof Louise Kenny said: âOur goal is to save the lives of affected mums and babies by reducing and eventually preventing the life-threatening complications associated with pre-eclampsia. âMums-to-be can be confident that they are in excellent hands as all participating obstetric recruitment centres [including UCC] have well-established track records and outstanding reputations for the research and management of pre-eclampsia.â First-time mothers who are interested in participating in the IMPROvED programme are asked to contact 021-4205026 or email improved@ucc.ie.

Reboot ordered for EU patent law Reboot ordered for EU patent law A European Parliament committee has ordered a rewrite of the proposals for controversial new European Union rules which govern computer-based inventions. The Legal Affairs Committee (JURI) said the Commission should re-submit the Computer Implemented Inventions Directive after MEPs failed to back it. It has had vocal critics who say it could favour large over small firms and impact open-source software innovation. Supporters say it would let firms protect their inventions. The directive is intended to offer patent protection to inventions that use software to achieve their effect, in other words, "computer implemented invention". The draft law suffered setbacks when Poland, one of the largest EU member states, rejected its adoption twice in two months. Intense lobbying on the issue has started to gain momentum in some national parliaments putting them under immense pressure. Only two MEPs backed the draft law at the JURI meeting, with one voting to abstain. Opponents of the draft directive welcomed the decision and said a new first reading of the proposals would give the EU a chance to have fuller debates about its implications in all member states. In the US, the patenting of computer programs and internet business methods is permitted. This means that the US-based Amazon.com holds a patent for its "one-click shopping" service, for example. Critics are concerned that the directive could lead to a similar model happening in Europe. This, they fear, could hurt small software developers because they do not have the legal and financial might of larger companies if they had to fight patent legal action in court. Supporters say current laws are inefficient and it would serve to even up a playing field without bringing EU laws in line with the US. Return to results
Republic to face China and Italy Republic to face China and Italy The Republic of Ireland have arranged friendlies against China and Italy which will take place at Lansdowne Road in March and August. Brian Kerr's side will face the 54th ranked Chinese on 29 March - just three days after the World Cup qualifier against Israel in Tel Aviv. Italy will visit on 17 August in what will be a warm-up game ahead of the autumn World Cup qualifiers. In their last meeting, the Irish beat Italy in the 1994 World Cup Finals. However, that is the Republic's only victory in eight attempts against the Italians who have won all the other seven games. The 29 March game will be the second time the Republic have played China - the previous encounter back in June 1984 with the Irish winning 1-0 in Sapporo, Japan. Brian Kerr said: "China have made great progress over the last few years and will provide difficult opposition. "We all witnessed the performances of the Asian teams in the last World Cup, and China play a similar type of football. "As for Italy, they make a welcome return to Dublin and will be a massive attraction because they are one of the great traditional powers in the world. "The game will be ideal preparation for the three important World Cup qualifiers in the autumn." Ireland round off their World Cup campaign with games against France on 7 September, Cyprus on 8 October and Switzerland on 12 October.
Robben sidelined with broken foot Robben sidelined with broken foot Chelsea winger Arjen Robben has broken two metatarsal bones in his foot and will be out for at least six weeks. Robben had an MRI scan on the injury, sustained during the Premiership win at Blackburn, on Monday. "Six weeks is the average time to heal this injury and then I need a few more weeks to be completely fit again," he told Dutch newspaper Algemeen Dagblad. "I had a feeling it was serious but because of the swelling it was impossible to make a final diagnosis." The 21-year-old missed the first three months of the season with a similar injury after a challenge with Roma's Olivier Dacourt. And he added: "It felt different then last summer when I had the same injury on my other foot. "Then I could walk already after three days but I stayed sidelined for a long period. I hope that it will now take me six to eight weeks." Chelsea physio Mike Banks was hopeful that Robben could return at some point in March. "The fractures are tiny and he could be playing next month," Banks told the club's website. "One is a chip on the side of his foot, the other is a small break on the third metatarsal. "But this is not the traditional metatarsal that has become so famous since the last World Cup and which has kept Scott Parker out for two months." David Beckham suffered a broken metatarsal in the build up to the 2002 World Cup in Korea and Japan. Robben, who has been a key part of the Blues' push for four trophies, claims he knew instantly something was wrong when he was felled by Blackburn midfielder Aaron Mokoena. "I felt my leg go," he said. "I felt it straight away after Mokoena hit me with a wild kick on my left foot." Comments are closed for this article.
Ronaldinho would consider Chelsea Ronaldinho would consider Chelsea Barcelona star Ronaldinho has hinted that he could be open to a move to Chelsea in future. The Brazilian claimed he rejected an offer from the Blues before agreeing a new contract in Spain last summer. But Ronaldinho told the News of the World: "Any great player would want to be part of such a sensational team. "What they are doing is amazing. It is a place where great things are going to happen. I respect them a lot and can maybe see myself in London one day." The 24-year-old has helped transform Barcelona since joining from French side Paris St Germain for Â£21m in 2003. And while he insists he is happy in Spain at the moment, he has been impressed with how things have developed at Stamford Bridge. "My brother, who is also my agent (Roberto Assis), has spoken to me about Chelsea many times," he said. "I had a chance to move to them before I came to Barcelona but at that time, even though they offered more money, I was not interested. "But I have seen since that Chelsea have a great infrastructure. "I am happy in Barcelona but I cannot rule out playing in another country in the future. I would love to play in England to prove that technical players can succeed there." Comments are closed for this article.
Rotunda master raises concerns over whether report will be acted on Rotunda master raises concerns over whether report will be acted on âThe HSE is a very big organisation; who is responsible for carrying this out, when will it be done by and where is the accountability?â Dr Sam Coulter Smyth: the master of the Rotunda Hospital insisted a degree of political will must come into the frame, âsomeone who can actually make things happenâ. The master of the Rotunda Hospital has said he is concerned about the extent to which the Health and Information and Quality Authority report into the death of Savita Halappanvar will be acted on, given past failures to implement reportsâ recommendations. Referencing a KPMG report on maternity services in 2008, Dr Sam Coulter Smith said: âMy concern is that when these sort of reports have come out before not all of the recommendations have been acted upon. âThere isnât accountability or responsibility attached to these recommendations. The HSE is a very big organisation; who is responsible for carrying this out, when will it be done by and where is the accountability? I would have liked to see this in the report,â he said. He insisted a degree of political will must come into the frame, âsomeone who can actually make things happenâ. âWe donât have the facilities or the back-up we need to provide world-class services,â he said. âI think this is the best opportunity we have ever had; there is more interest now in maternity services than there has ever been and I think it is really sad that it has taken something like the Savita case to get us to this point.â Meanwhile, Dr Peter Boylan, consultant obstetrician and clinical director at the National Maternity Hospital, said the Hiqa report was an âappalling indictment of State failures over many, many yearsâ, particularly in terms of staffing numbers. International standards âIf you take the minimum recommended number of consultant obstetricians, for example for the number of births not including gynaecology, there should be at least 200 in the State [as recommended by] internationally accepted standards . . .but there is about 120,â he said. He said the National Maternity Hospital has about eight consultants but equivalent hospitals in Denmark or Sweden have about 50. He also said that Ireland is behind international standards on the number of midwives, requiring a further 20 to 30 per cent. Sinn FÃ©in deputy leader Mary Lou McDonald said Hiqaâs report was âdamning on all frontsâ. â The authors of the report have found it impossible to provide assurances that women are receiving safe or reliable care during and after pregnancy,â she said. The Institute of Obstetricians and Gynecologists has said it would work closely with the Department of Health and HSE âas a matter of priorityâ on implementing the recommendations of the report.
SFA awaits report over Mikoliunas SFA awaits report over Mikoliunas The Scottish Football Association is awaiting referee Hugh Dallas's report before acting against Hearts winger Saulius Mikoliunas. Mikoliunas, 20, barged linesman Andy Davis, who had advised Dallas to award Rangers an injury-time penalty in Hearts's 2-1 defeat at Tynecastle. "He was sent off for violent conduct in the 90th minute but we don't know if he did something else after the whistle. "We don't know how many red cards he was shown," said an SFA statement. Hearts could also face action after three fans were arrested for throwing coins on the pitch. Rangers' striker Dad Prso was also sent off during the same incident when he received a second yellow card for wrestling the ball away from Craig Gordon and leaving the Hearts keeper on the ground. The SFA said: "Once the referee's report comes in then we'll immediately look at things. "We don't normally get the reports until a couple of days after the game but we're well aware of what happened here. "Prso was sent off for two cautions, and that will just be a one-match suspension." The SFA is certain to come down hard on Mikoliunas after Southampton's David Prutton was banned for 10-games on Wednesday by the English FA for shoving referee Alan Wiley. Hearts' boss John Robertson said: "Mikoliunas has thrown his chest against the assistant referee's chest and got a red card for it. "The officials have got to take into account the fact he's a young lad. "But people have got to take into account why he was incensed. Why were 10,000 Hearts fans incensed? "Why did nobody from the Rangers' bench claim for a penalty kick?" Rangers' boss Alex McLeish accepted referee Dallas had no option but to send Prso off. McLeish said: "I'm glad to see the spirit of the players fighting to the very end - literally with Dado trying to get the ball back from Craig Gordon. "But it was over-zealousness and I don't think Hugh had any option." Return to results
Santini resigns as Spurs manager Santini resigns as Spurs manager Tottenham manager Jacques Santini has resigned for "personal reasons". The former France manager moved to White Hart Lane this summer but now wants to return to France. Santini said: "My time at Tottenham has been memorable and it is with deep regret that I take my leave. I wish the club and the supporters all the best. "Private issues in my personal life have arisen which caused my decision. I very much hope that the wonderful fans will respect my decision." He added: "I should like to thank (sporting director) Frank Arnesen and (chairman) Daniel Levy for their understanding." Assistant coach Martin Jol has been put in temporary charge and will take care of team affairs for Saturday's Premiership match against Charlton. Arnesen said the club were sad to see Santini go: "We are obviously disappointed that Jacques is leaving us. We fully respect his decision. "I can assure you that the club will act swiftly to minimise the impact of Jacques' departure. "Our priority is to ensure that this season's performance remains unaffected by this move. "I shall make a further statement on Monday, clarifying our position. We wish Jacques well." Comments are closed for this article.
Shares pause on earnings concerns Shares pause on earnings concerns Subdued demand from China hits profits at Remy Cointreau and Hugo Boss European shares this morning lacked the momentum to extend a rally to multi-year highs. Photo: Online News European shares this morning lacked the momentum to extend a rally to multi-year highs, following downbeat signals from Remy Cointreau and Hugo Boss . Shares in Remy dropped 7.5 per cent after the French spirits group warned of a double-digit decline in full-year operating profit because of a slowdown in China. Subdued demand from China also hit performance at the German fashion house Hugo Boss, with shares falling 3.5 per cent after it delayed its 2015 profit target. Investors had been expecting earnings to pick up this year as the European and global ecomomy improves, but so far this has not happened and momentum - analyst upgrades minus downgrades - remains mired in negative territory. âEuropean equities are beginning to be a little bit stretched based on the fact that earnings expectations have not completely reversed ... You are seeing the forward (price-to-earnings) multiple rising, but the forward expectations for earnings are actually flat and thatâs not normally a very healthy sign,â said Peter Garnry , strategist at Saxo Bank . âI think it will change as we move into the new year and everyone begins to revise up their targets for the euro area economy.â The FTSEurofirst 300 was down 0.1 per cent at 1,301.33 points , pausing below a 5-year high of 1,316.42 set earlier this month. Monday marked the fourth quietest day so far in 2013 on the FTSEurofirst 300, with volumes a third below the year-to-date average, and traders braced for a similar pattern today.

Spurs to sign Iceland U21 star Spurs to sign Iceland U21 star Tottenham are primed to snap up Iceland Under-21 international Emil Hallfredsson after he impressed on trial at White Hart Lane. The 20-year-old midfielder, who plays for FH Hafnarfjordur, also starred in the Uefa Cup match against Scottish side Dunfermline earlier this season. Spurs have agreed a fee for the player, who has yet to agree personal terms. "He had offers from two other clubs but he decided to come to Tottenham," said Spurs sporting director Frank Arnesen. "He is a left-sided player, a position we have been looking at and he showed so much talent in his time here that we decided to take him. "It's down the road of bringing in talent, good prospects and giving them a place at Tottenham where they can improve." Return to results
Strike next Tuesday in protest over âdangerously longâ working hours Strike next Tuesday in protest over âdangerously longâ working hours The strike is likely to result in considerable disruption to hospitals around the country, with only emergency, oncology and dialysis services definitely unaffected. The Health Service Executive has urged junior doctors to reconsider plans for a one- day strike next week. The Irish Medical Organisation (IMO) has announced plans for a junior doctor strike next Tuesday in protest over âdangerously longâ working hours. The organisation has decided to resume its plans for a day of industrial action, which had been suspended while talks with the HSE were continuing. The strike is likely to result in considerable disruption to hospitals around the country, with only emergency, oncology and dialysis services definitely unaffected. The IMO said it had decided to reinstate plans for industrial action after the HSE failed to offer âsatisfactory clarificationâ on a number of issues of concern to the unionâs non-consultant hospital doctor (NCHD) committee. The key issue appears to be the demand by junior doctors for sanctions to be imposed on hospitals that fail to comply with the European Working Time Directive by an agreed deadline. The HSE expressed disappointment at the decision to serve strike notice. Expressing surprise, HSE national director for human resources Barry OâBrien said: âSignificant progress has been achieved at the Labour Relations Commission recently and this progress was subsequently confirmed and acknowledged by the IMO following that engagement. Proceeding with strike action at this time will only serve to create significant disruption for patients and the delivery of important services to them.â But Eric Young , IMO assistant director of industrial relations, said the HSE had failed to demonstrate to NCHDs that it was committed to addressing the crisis in a meaningful way.

Taking the highs with the lows Taking the highs with the lows I thought we gave a tremendous performance against Arsenal last week. And I have to say that anyone who saw our disallowed goal must realise there is no way it should ever have been ruled out. It was interesting to hear the TV pundits ask if it was disallowed because Dennis Bergkamp had been sent off moments before. I was surprised by the number of people who questioned whether the referee was trying to level things out. The major decision, which defeated me really, was the caution given to Cesc Fabregas for his tackle on Nick Montgomery. To me, that should have been a straight red card. Yet all I saw in the papers were accusations that Danny Cullip allegedly stamped on Fabregas. But when I watch it back, I don't see anything wrong there at all. As I've said in the past, you don't seem to get the rub of the green when you're a lower league club in these competitions. But we have to go into the replay without any fear and that's what will happen come Tuesday. The only thing we can learn from Arsenal's Champions League defeat against Bayern Munich is that we were even worse in our loss at Plymouth. We got beaten 3-0 and never looked like scoring! At least Arsenal got a goal and have a chance of winning at home in the second leg - and they've done that in the past. Whether they'll now want to risk their big stars on Tuesday against us, knowing they need to beat Bayern 2-0 a week later, is debatable. Unfortunately, we have not got a squad big enough to be able to rotate. And we're very thin on the ground for the replay - it looks like we'll be missing three or four of our better players. We don't know if goalkeeper Paddy Kenny will be okay after being carried off against Plymouth, and Cullip will be suspended. However, although the Cup is diverting our attention, the chances are we won't win it. So the league has to be our priority. An even more important match than the one against Arsenal comes on Saturday when we have to beat the Championship's bottom club Rotherham. And I will be reiterating to my players that we have 14 games left in the league and we have to start winning if we want to be in the play-offs. We've lost four in a row in the league now, but we haven't got time to feel sorry for ourselves.
Talks in Brussels cut short after division on basic principles persists Talks in Brussels cut short after division on basic principles persists European Central Bank president Mario Draghi, Minister for Finance Michael Noonan, Franceâs finance minister Pierre Moscovici and European Union Economic and Monetary Affairs Commissioner Olli Rehn attend an eurozone finance ministers meeting in Brussels. Photograph: Francois Lenoir/Online News European Union finance ministers struggled to advance a bank-failure plan for the euro area today, hampered by the interregnum in Berlin and persistent divisions on basic points. Ministers will be pressed to meet a year-end deadline to broker an accord after cutting short talks in Brussels today. The blocâs 28 nations are split on who should be the ultimate decision-maker in the planned Single Resolution Mechanism, whether it should be backed by a central fund and which banks should be covered. Germany reiterated its opposition to key planks of the blueprint proposed by the European Commission . Todayâs discussion âproved that today we still do not have agreement, so it was absolutely senseless to sit overnight, because thereâs still no way to get this final agreement,â said finance minister Rimantas Sadzius of Lithuania , which holds the EUâs rotating presidency. The Single Resolution Mechanism is part of a euro-area effort to break the financial links between sovereigns and banks by centralizing oversight and crisis management of failing lenders. The proposal, presented in July by Michel Barnier , the EUâs financial services chief, initially met with a barrage of complaints from governments. EU leaders nevertheless reaffirmed last month that nations should agree on a common stance by the end of this year and called the plan is an essential complement to European Central Bank supervision of euro-area lenders, which begins in a year. Common fund German finance minister Wolfgang Schaeuble called on his colleagues to rein in their ambitions for the SRM, including the proposed central fund. He has said Mr Barnierâs centralized blueprint should be scrapped in favour of a network of national authorities without a common fund, on the basis that further steps can only be taken once changes are made to the EUâs basic treaties. Todayâs debate âshowed that of course we canât get a perfect solution on the basis of current treaties,â Mr Schaeuble said. He noted a âdeepened understandingâ among his colleagues that a sound legal basis for any resolution system âis necessary not only from a German point of view.â German chancellor Angela Merkelâs Christian Democratic bloc is in talks with the Social Democrats to form a so-called grand coalition government, almost two months after Ms Merkelâs party won the largest share of the vote in parliamentary elections. âNo governmentâ âAs long as there is no government in Germany I donât see progress,â Dutch finance minister Jeroen Dijsselbloem said. The barriers in the way of making progress at todayâs gathering led Mr Sadzius to scale back plans for a series of one- on-one meetings with finance ministers, shortening the meeting by several hours. A planned dinner was also cancelled. Mr Sadzius said that he would seek a political deal on the plans at the ministersâ next meeting on December 10th. Minister for Finance Michael Noonan raised the prospect that finance ministers may have to convene again after that meeting to get a deal. âIt seemed to me that thereâs a lot of goodwill to get decisions taken in December, and itâll be up now to the Lithuanian presidency to do that at the regular meeting or to do it at a special meeting,â Mr Noonan said. .

Taoiseach stresses need to reduce deficit in address to business leaders Taoiseach stresses need to reduce deficit in address to business leaders Kenny says Governmentâs main objective is to fix public finances Dan Doctoroff, ceo and president of Online News, at the Convention Centre, Dublin where he addressed the Dublin Chamber of Commerce Annual Dinner, with Bernard Byrne of AIB, Liam Kavanagh, president of the Dublin Chamber of Commerce, and Gina Quinn, CEO of the Dublin Chamber of Commerce. Photograph: Brenda Fitzsimons Charlie Taylor Restoring Irelandâs reputation for prudent financial management is key to getting more investment and jobs into the country, Taoiseach Enda Kenny has said. Addressing more than 1,600 business leaders at the annual Dublin Chamber of Commerce dinner in the Convention Centre last night, Mr Kenny also said that while agreement has been reached to ensure that spending cuts and tax increases will be less than previously forecast, next weekâs Budget will still be difficult for many. Mr Kenny said the Governmentâs main objectives in the Budget is to continue the job of fixing the public finances in order to exit the bailout later this year and to invest in the creation of jobs. The Taoiseach said the Government remains committed to reducing the deficit to below 5 per cent next year and below 3 per cent by 2015. âThe gap between day-to- day Government spending and tax receipts is still one of the highest in the euro zone. It is also unsustainable,â he said. Mr Kenny used his speech to highlight the role that Dublin plays in driving the national economy. Claiming that the cityâs best days are still to come, he said much work has been done in recent years to transform the capital from âan underdeveloped resource to a modern, cosmopolitan and creative cityâ. âDublin has become a true international city. And as such Dublin is now competing for investment and jobs with competitor cities all over the world,â he said. The greatest way to commemorate Dublin in 1916 will be for our capital city, 100 years on in 2016, to be a vibrant, attractive, and successful city.â The chief executive and president of Online News Dan Doctoroff said Irelandâs decision to make difficult decisions and keep investing during recessionary times will help it to recover. Mr Doctoroff, who also served as deputy mayor for economic development and rebuilding of New York following the September 11th attacks in 2001, said constant investment, radical self-awareness and the ability to think big are key skills needed to rebuild economies. Praising the decisions taken over the past five years to bolster the economy, he said Ireland would emerge stronger than before. âThe challenge of thinking big is that it doesnât always show up in the next quarterly GDP report,â he said. âIn Ireland your determination to keep investing in the things that really matter has allowed you to become a place where Irish entrepreneurs are building and creating jobs and taking ideas to the world.â âBad tasteâ Director of personal, business and corporate banking at AIB Bernard Byrne told business leaders the excesses of the past, both within the banking industry and further afield, had âleft us with a bad taste and a strong desire for the opposite regime to prevail.â He added that the banking system was close to being back on track. âWhile the work is not completed, the significant restructuring of the industry that has seen â¬70 billion of loans delivered across the industry and massive shrinkage of headcount are more in the past than a future prospect,â he said. âThe signs of the return to profitability are strong and 2013 will prove to have been the watershed year where the debate about credit provisions is finally laid to rest with the pillar banks seeing 2014 as the year when profits exceed provisions for the first time. We are within touching distance of the self-financing viable banks that are so badly needed.â Grounds for optimism President of Dublin Chamber of Commerce Liam Kavanagh said there were grounds for optimism about the economy but that more needed to be done to get the country back on track. Calling for the retention of the 9 per cent Vat rate, he also stressed the need to retain the current corporation tax rate to attract foreign investment. Mr Kavanagh also stressed the need for a directly elected mayor for the capital. âDublin needs its own âpolitical championâ. The Chamber believes that Dublin should have a directly elected Mayor. But that office must have real executive power and authority to drive the promotion of enterprise, innovation, tourism and transport for the city,â he said. Return to results
The gaming world in 2005 The gaming world in 2005 If you have finished Doom 3, Half Life 2 and Halo 2, don't worry. There's a host of gaming gems set for release in 2005. WORLD OF WARCRAFT The US reception to this game from developers Blizzard has been hugely enthusiastic, with the title topping its competitors in the area of life-eating, high-fantasy, massively multiplayer role-player gaming. Solid, diverse, accessible and visually striking, it may well open up the genre like never before. If nothing else, it will develop a vast and loyal community. Released 25 February on PC. ICO 2 (WORKING TITLE) Ico remains a benchmark for PS2 gaming, a title that took players into a uniquely atmospheric and artistic world of adventure. The (spiritual) sequel has visuals that echo those of the original, but promises to expand the Ico world, with hero Wanda taking on a series of giants. The other known working title is Wanda And Colossus. Release date to be confirmed on PS2. THE LEGEND OF ZELDA The charismatic cel imagery has been scrapped in favour of a dark, detailed aesthetic (realism isn't quite the right word) that connects more with Ocarina Of Time. Link resumes his more teenage incarnation too, though enemies, elements and moves look familiar from the impressive trailer that has been released. Horseback adventuring across a vast land is promised. Release date to be confirmed on GameCube. ADVANCE WARS DS The UK Nintendo DS launch line-up is still to be confirmed at time of writing, but titles that exploit its two-screen and touch capacity, like WarioWare Touched! and Sega's Feel The Magic, are making a strong impression in other territories. Personally, I can't wait for the latest Advance Wars, the franchise that has been the icing on the cake of Nintendo handheld gaming during the past few years. Release date to be confirmed on DS. S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Following in the high-spec footsteps of Far Cry and Half-Life 2, this looks like the key upcoming PC first-person shooter (with role-playing elements). The fact that it is inspired in part by Andrei Tarkovsky's enigmatic 1979 masterpiece Stalker and set in 2012 in the disaster zone, a world of decay and mutation, makes it all the more intriguing. Released 1 March on PC. METAL GEAR SOLID: SNAKE EATER More Hideo Kojima serious stealth, featuring action in the Soviet-controlled jungle in 1964. The game see Snake having to survive on his wits in the jungle, including eating wildlife. Once again, expect cinematic cut scenes and polished production values. Released March on PS2. DEAD OR ALIVE ULTIMATE Tecmo's Team Ninja are back with retooled and revamped versions of Dead Or Alive 1 and 2. Here's the big, big deal though - they're playable over Xbox Live. Released 11 March on Xbox. KNIGHTS OF THE OLD REPUBLIC II Looks set to build on the acclaimed original Star Wars role playing game with new characters, new Force powers and a new set of moral decisions, despite a different developer. Released 11 February on Xbox and PC. Return to results
The gloves are off The gloves are off When Arsenal play Manchester United on Tuesday, a fixture that is usually a title-decider has this time been relegated to undercard status. Both teams will be playing for pride and hoping for a win to seize on any possible hiccup by Premiership leaders Chelsea. Arsenal and United have been left in the slipstream of the Stamford Bridge outfit and the reason, according to many experts, is goalkeeping woes. While Chelsea keeper Petr Cech, who the Gunners missed out on signing, has conceded only eight league goals so far this season, his rivals have had their quality questioned after high-profile mistakes and misdemeanours. Arsenal have let in 24 goals as Jens Lehmann has been dropped in favour of Manuel Almunia, who has failed to convince the doubters, despite holding Highbury's number one jersey. Roy Carroll has wrestled the first-team keeper spot at United from Tim Howard, whose errors cost him his place, but he still has doubts hanging over his credentials. "It's like a heartbreak for goalkeepers like me and Peter Shilton," ex-Gunners keeper Bob Wilson told Online News Radio Five Live's Sportsweek programme in assessment of the general level of goalkeeping at present. Shilton is England's most-capped player and he believes the lack of top-class keepers is a reason for the predicament at Arsenal and United. "They are adequate," he said. "You look around and there are not too many other goalkeepers who you would think were better." Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger and his Old Trafford counterpart Sir Alex Ferguson have tried in vain to find new players of a similar quality to replace David Seaman and Peter Schmeichel. Seaman was at Arsenal for 13 years, while Schmeichel was at Old Trafford for eight years and was hailed as the "bargain of the century" by Ferguson after he signed him for Â£600,000. Wilson and Shilton have cited the lack of technique of the current generation but both agree they would have Lehmann in goal ahead of Almunia at Arsenal. Wilson explained: "I would defend Jens Lehman last season because he was top of every stat going. "He had an absolutely phenomenal season but, unfortunately, a couple of big errors came in the Champions League against Chelsea and Arsene is a hard taskmaster and so he suddenly started to change and take a real chance on the Spaniard. "Lehmann has excellent basic technique and young Almunia is still learning the game. "I believe at the moment Lehmann has an advantage over Almunia but the man who is paid to make those decisions, and that's Arsene, will continue to play Almunia." Shilton echoed: "Lehmann did well. Arsenal were unbeaten for so many games and he was very consistent but the minute he made one or two mistakes and people got on to his back he seemed to lose a bit of confidence. "Arsenal and United could have better goalkeepers but those they have got are not doing too badly. "They are making the odd one or two serious errors and the spotlight is going to be on them but they have to put it to the back of their minds and roll their sleeves up." Former Arsenal manager George Graham brought Seaman to Highbury and he has his own theory. He said: "I would disagree with Bob and Peter about technique. I think decision-making from the majority of goalkeepers I've seen this season is the problem." Return to results
Think-tank delivers one of its most upbeat assessments on economy Think-tank delivers one of its most upbeat assessments on economy Prof John Fitzgerald of the ESRI: âOur view is itâs safer to do the â¬3 billion this yearâ The Government risks missing its fiscal targets for next year by opting for a budgetary adjustment of less than â¬3.1 billion, the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI) has warned. In its latest quarterly economic commentary the think-tank delivered one of its most upbeat assessments on the economy since the financial crash, forecasting gross national product (GNP) growth rates of 2 per cent for this year and 2.7 per cent for 2014, well ahead of current Government predictions. However, it warned the reduced budgetary target of â¬2.5 billion, signalled by Minister for Finance Michael Noonan yesterday, could trigger another round of austerity measures in next yearâs budget if the Governmentâs growth forecasts fail to materialise. In its analysis the institute predicted the public finances would come in ahead of target this year, with borrowing at around 7 per cent of GDP, below the troika ceiling target of 7.5 per cent. It said it continued to hold the view that âthe most prudent course of actionâ was to implement an adjustment of â¬3.1 billion in next weekâs budget. Troika target This level of adjustment would reduce the budget deficit to 4.5 per cent of GDP by the end of next year, it said, significantly below the troika target of 5.1 per cent, which would allow the Government end the current sequence of austerity budgets. âOur view is itâs safer to do the â¬3 billion this year, but if they [the Government] do â¬2.5 billion they may get away with it provided the growth forecasts are correct,â said Prof John FitzGerald of the ESRI. Having predicted in July that Irelandâs GNP, a more accurate measure of the countryâs economic activity, would grow by 1.2 per cent this year and 0.5 per cent in 2014, the institute revised these figures upwards to 2 per cent and 2.7 per cent respectively. While it cautioned that the forecasts were heavily reliant on growth predictions in the euro zone and elsewhere, the ESRI said there were now âdefinite signs of recoveryâ coming from several sectors of the economy. The instituteâs forecasts are more optimistic than the Department of Financeâs own projections released yesterday, which predicted GNP would grow by 1 per cent this year and by 1.4 per cent in 2014. However, the ESRI lowered its predictions for GDP growth, the widest measure of wealth created by an individual country, to 0.5 per cent this year and 2.6 per cent for 2014. It cited falling profits in some of Irelandâs biggest pharmaceutical companies as a result of a âpatent cliffâ. Blockbuster drugs Over the last couple of years a number of big blockbuster drugs produced here, most notably cholesterol drug Lipitor, have fallen out of patent. In its commentary the institute said the âclearest signalâ of recovery was reflected by the continued growth in employment and the downward slide in unemployment, which it predicted would fall below 300,000 this year, and continue on a downward trajectory in 2014. It forecast that unemployment would hover at around 13 per cent next year, which was higher than the Department of Financeâs forecast of 12.6 per cent. For the first six months of the year, the ESRI noted, there was an increase of 27,300 in total employment, compared with the first half of 2012. While agriculture, forestry and fishing remained the source of the largest increases in employment, the institute said it believed these sectors may be artificially inflated and that improving employment conditions were more likely coming from expansions within the services sector. .

Tobacco giant says plain packaging could lead to State compensation Tobacco giant says plain packaging could lead to State compensation Legal opinion commissioned by cigarette producer says James Reillyâs plan could come at âhigh priceâ for taxpayer The Government last week approved the first draft of laws to allow for plain packaging. Fiach Kelly The worldâs largest tobacco company has warned the Government the introduction of plain packaging for cigarettes could lead to âan extremely high priceâ of compensation being paid to multinational tobacco companies by the taxpayer. Philip Morris Ltd, the British arm of Philip Morris International , which is responsible for cigarette brands such as Marlboro, commissioned a legal opinion in response to proposals to introduce plain packaging in the Republic. It said such moves would not âwithstand legal scrutinyâ without providing compensation to the tobacco companies involved. The opinion and accompanying letter, seen by The Online News, were sent to Minister for Finance Michael Noonan and Minister for Health James Reilly . The legal opinion, drafted by Michael M Collins SC, warned that the legal implications of banning tobacco branding were âpredictable and starkâ. The Government last week approved the first draft of laws to allow for plain packaging, the Public Health (Standardised Packaging of Tobacco) Bill, which will also allow for larger warnings on standard packets. Philip Morrisâs letter, sent last June, said plain packaging and larger health warnings involve similar legal issues. Return to results
Trade surplus falls by 3 per cent in September Trade surplus falls by 3 per cent in September But third quarter exports rose by 4.9 per cent as strong recovery through the summer lifts data Lower pharmaceutical exports hit overall goods trade. Photograph: Stephen Morton/Online News Irelandâs trade surplus fell by 3 per cent in September as lower pharmaceutical exports hit overall goods trade. But despite a 5 per cent decline in exports to â¬7.3 billion, the figures still remained higher than the average export figures in the year to date. Analysts, meanwile, took positives from the quarterly data, which showed exports were up 4.9 per cent quarter-on-quarter as strong recovery inthe summer lifted data. The trade surplus fell to just under â¬3.2 billion in September, from â¬3.28 billion in August, according to preliminary figures. A â¬364 million decline in seasonally adjusted exports was partially offset by a fall of 6 per cent, or â¬274 million in imports, as the value of pharmaceutical exports decreased by 17 per cent, while petroleum and related products were 69 per cent lower compared with the same month in 2012. The EU remains Irelandâs biggest export market, accounting for 56 per cent of all exports in September. Outside the EU, the US was the top destination for Irish goods, taking 23 per cent of exports. âThe worst of the patent cliff looks to have affected the trade numbers at the turn of the year, but more hits cannot be discounted in the short term,â Davyâs David McNamara said. â More importantly, the upturn in the global cycle bodes well for exports from the wider manufacturing sector.â .

Transgender people are not legally recognised in Ireland although Minister for Social Protection Joa... Transgender people are not legally recognised in Ireland although Minister for Social Protection Joan Burton has committed to such legislation. Almost 80 per cent of transgender people here have considered suicide and 40 per cent of these have attempted suicide at least once, a survey published today finds. The study on mental health and wellbeing among the transgender community finds 78 per cent have considered suicide and 44 per cent have engaged in some form of self-harm. The study, Speaking From The Margins, is the first on mental health in the Irish âtransâ community and was conducted by Transgender Equality Network Ireland . It is based on a survey of 164 participants carried out with the support of the HSE and Denis OâBrienâs social charity, the Iris OâBrien Foundation. Mental wellbeing Although the sample is relatively small, the study confirms the findings of larger international studies on the mental wellbeing of transgender people. Transgender people have a gender identity or expression different to the one they were born with. They are not legally recognised in Ireland â Ireland is the last State in Europe not to allow transgender people to have their birth certificate reissued in their preferred gender, although Minister for Social Protection Joan Burton has committed to such legislation. Among the reasons given for self-harming and suicidality are gender dysphoria (extreme distress associated with discontent with oneâs gender), family rejection, stigma, harassment and uncertainty around the question of transitioning to their preferred gender.

US hacker breaks into T-Mobile US hacker breaks into T-Mobile A man is facing charges of hacking into computers at the US arm of mobile phone firm T-Mobile. The Californian man, Nicholas Lee Jacobsen, was arrested in October. Mr Jacobsen tried at least twice to hack T-Mobile's network and took names and social security numbers of 400 customers, said a company spokesman. The arrest came a year after T-Mobile uncovered the unauthorised access. The US Secret Service has been investigating the case. "T-Mobile has stringent procedures in place where we monitor for suspicious activity so that limited his activities and we were able to take corrective action immediately," Peter Dobrow, a T-Mobile spokesperson said. It is thought that Mr Jacobsen's hacking campaign took place over at least seven months during which time he read e-mails and personal computer files, according to court records. Although Mr Jacobsen, 21, managed to get hold of some data, it is thought he failed to get customer credit card numbers which are stored on a separate computer system, said Mr Dobrow. T-Mobile confirmed that the US Secret Service was also looking into whether the hacker accessed photos that T-Mobile subscribers had taken with their camera phones. The Associated Press agency reported that Mr Jacobsen also read personal files on the Secret Service agent who was apparently investigating the case. A Los Angeles grand jury indicted Mr Jacobsen with intentionally accessing a computer system without authorisation and with the unauthorised impairment of a protected computer between March and October 2004. He is currently on bail. T-Mobile is a subsidiary company of Deutsche Telekom and has about 16.3 million subscribers in the US. Return to results
Uefa approves fake grass Uefa approves fake grass Uefa says it will allow European matches to be played on artificial pitches from the start of next season. European football's governing body made the decision at a meeting of its Executive Committee on Wednesday. Uefa explained that the move "follows comprehensive studies into the sporting and medical aspects of using artificial playing surfaces." They can be used subject to complying with Uefa quality criteria but there use will not be made obligatory. Luton, Preston, Queens Park Rangers and other clubs used to have plastic pitches during the the 1980s but, after a two-year study, Uefa insists the surfaces have moved on. International matches can also be played on such pitches, although games at major tournaments have to be contested on grass. Uefa spokesman Rob Faulkner said: "People in England have bad memories of the artificial pitches of Luton and QPR in the 1980s, but the latest generation are completely different and are much more like grass. "We have sanctioned its use from the start of next season but only as long as it is the latest generation of artificial turf and meets a whole series of standards." Several leading clubs from Scandinavia, Russia and eastern Europe - especially those who only play Champions League or Uefa Cup matches in winter - are now expected to instal artificial pitches.

Varadkar pushed 9% VAT rate for hospitality sector Varadkar pushed 9% VAT rate for hospitality sector Minister for Tourism asked FÃ¡ilte Ireland to commission report on impact of reduced rate Minister for Tourism Leo Varadkar: said 9 per cent VAt rate had been one of the most successful job creation measures implemented by Government to date. Photograph: Alan Betson Details of lobbying within Cabinet ahead of the retention of the reduced 9 per cent VAT rate of the hospitality sector have emerged with the release, under the Freedom of Information Act, of a letter from Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport Leo Varadkar to Minister for Finance Michael Noonan . The Minister for Finance retained the 9 per cent rate in spite of giving strong indications in the run-up to the budget that it would increase. Mr Varadkar asked FÃ¡ilte Ireland to commission a report on the impact of the lower rate with the report carried out by Deloitte. In his letter dated July 31st, Mr Varadkar stated that, in light of the report, âI believe that not only are there very strong economic grounds of maintaining the 9 per cent rate, but that it is affordable from an exchequer perspectiveâ. He said it had been one of the most successful job-creation measures implemented by Government to date. âIt has helped to drive an increase in overseas tourist numbers and revenue due to an improved perception for value for money in Ireland which has in turn helped to create between 10,000 and 25,000 new jobs depending on which study you provide.

Why Cell will get the hard sell Why Cell will get the hard sell The world is casting its gaze on the Cell processor for the first time, but what is so important about it, and why is it so different? The backers of the processor are big names in the computer industry. IBM is one of the largest and most respected chip-makers in the world, providing cutting edge technology to large businesses. Sony will be using the chip inside its PlayStation 3 console, and its dominance of the games market means that it now has a lot of power to dictate the future of computer and gaming platforms. The technology inside the Cell is being heralded as revolutionary, from a technical standpoint. Traditional computers - whether they are household PCs or PlayStation 2s - use a single processor to carry out the calculations that run the computer. The Cell technology, on the other hand, uses multiple Cell processors linked together to run lots of calculations simultaneously. This gives it processing power an order of magnitude above its competitors. Whilst its rivals are working on similar technology, it is Sony's which is the most advanced. The speed of computer memory has been slowly increasing over the last few years, but the memory technology that accompanies the Cell is a huge leap in performance. Using a technology called XDR, created by American firm Rambus, memory can run up to eight times faster than the current standard being promoted by Intel. Perhaps more important than any of the technology is the Cell's role in the imminent "war on living rooms". The big trend predicted for this year is the convergence of computers with home entertainment devices such as DVD players and hi-fis. Companies like Microsoft and Sony believe that there is a lot of money to be made by putting a computer underneath the TV of every household and then offering services such as music and video downloads, as well as giving an individual access to all the media they already own in one place. Microsoft has already made its first tactical move into this area with its Windows Media Center software, which has been adopted by many PC makers. Sony had a stab at something similar with the PSX - a variation on the PlayStation - last year in Japan, although this attempt was generally seen as a failure. Both companies believe that increasing the capabilities of games consoles, to make them as powerful as PCs, will make the technology accessible enough to persuade buyers to give them pride of place on the video rack. Sony and IBM want to make sure that the dominance of the PC market enjoyed by Microsoft and Intel is not allowed to extend to this market. By creating a radically new architecture, and using that architecture in a games console that is sure to be a huge seller, they hope that the Cell processor can become the dominant technology in the living room, shutting out their rivals. Once they have established themselves under the TV, there is no doubt that they hope to use this as a base camp to extend their might into our traditional PCs and instigate a regime change on the desktop. Cell is, in fact, specifically designed to be deployed throughout the house. The links between the multiple processors can also be extended to reach Cell processors in entirely different systems. Sony hopes to put Cells in televisions, kitchen appliances and anywhere that could use any sort of computer chip. Each Cell will be linked to the others, creating a vast home network of computing power. Resources of the Cells across the house can be pooled to provide more power, and the links can also be used to enable devices to talk to each other, so that you can programme your microwave from your TV, for example. This digital home of the future depends on the widespread adoption of the Cell processor and there are, as with all things, a number of reasons it could fail. Because the processor is so different, it requires programmers to learn a different way of writing software, and it may be that the changeover is simply too difficult for them to master. You can also guarantee that Microsoft and Intel are not going to sit around and let Cell take over home computing without a fight. Microsoft is going to be pushing its Xbox 2 as hard as possible to make sure that its technology, not Sony's, will be under your tree next Christmas. Intel will be furiously working on new designs that address the problems of its current chips to create a rival technology to Cell, so that it doesn't lose its desktop PC dominance. If Cell succeeds in becoming the living room technology of choice, however, it could provide the jump-start to the fully digital home of the future. The revolution might not be televised, but it could well be played with a videogame controller. Return to results
Windows worm travels with Tetris Windows worm travels with Tetris Users are being warned about a Windows virus that poses as the hugely popular Tetris game. The Cellery worm installs a playable version of the classic falling blocks game on PCs that it has infected. While users play the game, the worm spends its time using the machine to search for new victims to infect on nearby networks. The risk of infection by Cellery is thought to be very low as few copies of the worm have been found in the wild. The Cellery worm does not spread via e-mail like many other viruses. Instead it browses computer networks for PCs that have not shut off all the insecure ways they connect to other machines. When it infects a machine, Cellery installs a version of Tetris that users can play. As the game starts up the worm also starts a music file to accompany it. At the same time the virus starts scouring networks for other vulnerable machines. The virus does no damage to machines but heavily infected networks could slow down as scanning traffic builds. Productivity may suffer too if users spend time playing Tetris. PCs running Windows 95, 98, ME, NT, 2000, and XP could be vulnerable to the worm. "If your company has a culture of allowing games to be played in the office, your staff may believe this is simply a new game that has been installed - rather than something that should cause concern," said Graham Cluley, spokesman for anti-virus firm Sophos. So far the number of people infected by Cellery is thought to be very small and the risks of further infection is very low. Sophos urged users and companies to update their anti-virus software to keep themselves protected. Return to results
2004 - A year to remember 2004 - A year to remember Club football in South America continues to suffer from the continent's economic crisis. The best players are lured across the Atlantic - 900 players left Brazil alone in 2004. And crowds are low, with money tight and the fear of violence proving a powerful incentive to stay at home. The average attendance in this year's Brazilian Championship was a record low of 8,139. Furthermore, in 2004 no new talent exploded on the continent with quite the same force as Diego, Robinho and Carlos Tevez in the two previous years. There is no doubt that the highlight of South America's footballing year has to come from the international game. There were some dramatic tournaments in 2004. The Copa America, held in Peru last July, could hardly have come to a more exciting conclusion. With the last kick of the final Brazil scored one of the most decisive equalising goals in the history of football. Argentina thought they had the game won and were in no state to take penalties when Adriano's 93rd-minute blast forced a shoot-out. Earlier in the year there was intense disappointment for Brazil when they amazingly failed to qualify for the Olympic football tournament. The gold medal is the only title they lack but they will have to wait four more years after missing out on the two qualification slots up for grabs in South America's Under-23 Championships, held in Chile in January. Argentina and Paraguay made it through and went on to secure gold and silver in Athens. These tournaments were terrific but the real highlights of the year in South American football could only come from the World Cup qualification campaign. The reason? It is the only time that all the great players come back home and play competitive matches in front of their own fans. I well remember getting a shiver down my spine awaiting the kick-off of the match between Brazil and Argentina at the start of June. Euro 2004 was about to get under way. The thought struck me that the accumulation of talent on the Belo Horizonte pitch was at least as outstanding as that about to go into action in Portugal. For 90 minutes Brazil was the capital of the football world. Ronaldo obviously felt the sense of occasion. He will probably never play a bigger match in Brazil and it was taking place in the stadium where he had made his name over a decade earlier. He was unstoppable, suffering and scoring three penalties in Brazil's 3-1 win. If Ronaldo's performance was the individual highlight of the year, my collective prize goes to Argentina in a match they played a few months later. In October I was down in Buenos Aires to see their first match under new coach Jose Pekerman. Nerves were settled with an early goal and old rivals Uruguay were blasted away. Soon after half-time Argentina were four up and although Uruguay hit back with two consolation goals, it was the performance of the hosts that lingers in the memory. Argentina's goals were magnificent team efforts involving all of the fundamentals of well-played football. The ball moved quickly around the field, with plenty of running off the ball to provide options and lots of crisp, accurate passing, mixing long and short to find gaps in the defence. The crowd responded in fine style, creating the kind of atmosphere familiar to all those old enough to remember the 1978 World Cup. These, then, were my highlights of 2004. With seven vital rounds of World Cup qualifiers scheduled for next year, South American football should come up with much more to celebrate in 2005. Return to results
Attack prompts Bush site block Attack prompts Bush site block The official re-election site of President George W Bush is blocking visits from overseas users for "security reasons". The blocking began early on Monday so those outside the US and trying to view the site got a message saying they are not authorised to view it. But keen net users have shown that the policy is not being very effective. Many have found that the site can still be viewed by overseas browsers via several alternative net addresses. The policy of trying to stop overseas visitors viewing the site is thought to have been adopted in response to an attack on the georgewbush.com website. Scott Stanzel, a spokesman for the Bush-Cheney campaign said: "The measure was taken for security reasons." He declined to elaborate any further on the blocking policy. The barring of non-US visitors has led to the campaign being inundated with calls and forced it to make a statement about why the blocking was taking place. In early October a so-called "denial of service" attack was mounted on the site that bombarded it with data from thousands of PCs. The attack made the site unusable for about five hours. About the same time the web team of the Bush-Cheney campaign started using the services of a company called Akamai that helps websites deal with the ebbs and flows of visitor traffic. Akamai uses a web-based tool called EdgeScape that lets its customers work out where visitors are based. Typically this tool is used to ensure that webpages, video and images load quickly but it can also be used to block traffic. Geographic blocking works because the numerical addresses that the net uses to organise itself are handed out on a regional basis. Readers of the Boingboing weblog have found that viewers can still get at the site by using alternative forms of the George W Bush domain name. Ironically one of the working alternatives is for a supposedly more secure version of the site. There are now at least three working alternative domains for the Bush-Cheney campaign that let web users outside the US visit the site. The site can also be seen using anonymous proxy services that are based in the US. Some web users in Canada also report that they can browse the site. The international exclusion zone around georgewbush.com was spotted by net monitoring firm Netcraft which keeps an eye on traffic patterns across many different sites. Netcraft said that since the early hours of 25 October attempts to view the site through its monitoring stations in London, Amsterdam and Sydney have failed. By contrast Netcraft's four monitoring stations in the US managed to view the site with no problems. Data gathered by Netcraft on the pattern of traffic to the site shows that the blocking is not the result of another denial of service attack. Mike Prettejohn, Netcraft president, speculated that the blocking decision might have been taken to cut costs, and traffic, in the run-up to the election on 2 November. He said the site may see no reason to distribute content to people who will not be voting next week. Managing traffic could also be a good way to ensure that the site stays working in the closing days of the election campaign. However, simply blocking non-US visitors also means that Americans overseas are barred too. Most American soldiers stationed overseas will be able to see the site as they use the US military's own portion of the net. Akamai declined to comment, saying it could not talk about customer websites. Comments are closed for this article.
Banks increasing variable rates in search of profits, says McHale Banks increasing variable rates in search of profits, says McHale Chairman of the Fiscal Council Prof John McHale: told the Oireachtas committee that if forecasts for economic growth turned out to be accurate, then âeverything was looking goodâ, but that it depended on growth. Photograph: Dara Mac DÃ³naill Regulation may be needed to protect variable mortgages holders from being targeted by the banks for additional profits, the chairman of the Fiscal Council told an Oireachtas committee yesterday. Prof John McHale was responding to Michael Creed (Fine Gael) who pointed out that the banks were increasing their variable interest rates at a time when the European Central Bank was lowering rates. Policy Speaking in a personal capacity, Prof McHale said the issue needed to be looked at closely from a policy perspective. The banks were under pressure to increase their profits, particularly because of the loss-making tracker mortgages they also had on their books. âVariable mortgage rate holders are very vulnerable, especially when they are in negative equity.â He agreed with Richard Boyd Barrett (Not for Profit Alliance) that if forecasts for economic growth turned out to be accurate, then âeverything was looking goodâ, but that it depended on growth. He said there should be â¬2 billion in consolidation measures in 2015, a neutral budget in 2016, and that there would be âlimited roomâ for expansionary measures in the period to 2019. Because the Government had gone for â¬2.5 billion in consolidation measures in the budget, rather than â¬3.1 billion as earlier expected, the margin of safety that had existed had been reduced in terms of achieving a 3 per cent deficit by 2016. Prof McHale said that if economic growth did not turn out to be as strong as predicted, the Government should introduce additional consolidation measures in 2015. If growth was greater than expected, the Government should use the extra resources to increase the size of Irelandâs safety buffer, he said. Credit line Council member Donal OâDonovan said its members continued to believe Ireland would be better off with a precautionary credit line as it exited the bailout. Prof McHale, responding to Lucinda Creighton (Reform Alliance), said having a credit line would have given Ireland more assured access to the ECBâs Outright Monetary Transactions programme, in the context of a âsystemic crisisâ in the euro zone. He said there was always a possibility of another âflare upâ in the euro crisis. âThings can turn very quickly. So you need to think of how you can protect yourself.â Comments are closed for this article.
Beckham hints at Man Utd return Beckham hints at Man Utd return England captain David Beckham said he would return to Manchester United if he ever leaves Real Madrid. Beckham left United in July 2003 after falling out with Sir Alex Ferguson and has been linked with a return to London if he decided to move back to England. "If I ever leave I would go back to United and work with Sir Alex again, definitely," he told the Daily Mirror. "Manchester United were the club that I grew up with and felt that I would always be there my whole career." However, Beckham insisted he was happy at Real, and said he still had plenty to prove in Spain. "I have been here for a year and a half and I have not played my best football in the past few months," he said. "But I am happy. I am playing with some of the best players in the world and I want to win the top prizes like the Spanish league and the Champions League." Meanwhile, Beckham said he would fight for his international place amid pressure from Manchester City's rising star Shaun Wright-Phillips. "He deserves his chance because of the way he has been playing and I am genuinely pleased to see him doing so well," he said. "People ask me if I'm worried about him. I'm not worried because I am proud of the England team and I want the best for it. "I'm the captain. It's in my interests to have the best players in the team as well. "I am not a jealous person and I am pleased for young kids coming through. We are talking about team-mates of mine. "Shaun is a threat to me because he plays in the same position, but we can also play in other positions. "I believe I will still be in the England team in 2006. I believe I will be England captain for that World Cup." Return to results
Benitez issues warning to Gerrard Benitez issues warning to Gerrard Liverpool manager Rafael Benitez has ordered captain Steven Gerrard not to play down their Champions League ambitions and be more positive. Gerrard told the Online News Liverpool were unlikely to win the trophy this year. Benitez responded: "I spoke to Steven and said to him that in future it's better to think we can win the Champions League. Why not?" He said: "We need winners here and everyone thinking only of winning. I always want to win." Benitez added: "When we lose I only think of solutions. If you only think about winning the next game, you don't know what the draw will be. "If we can win the next game, maybe we will draw a side that isn't so strong, or a side with injuries or suspensions." Benitez is hoping to win his first trophy since arriving at Liverpool from Valencia when they play Chelsea in the Carling Cup on Sunday in Cardiff.
Blackburn 0-1 Chelsea Blackburn 0-1 Chelsea Chelsea extended their lead at the top of the Premiership to 11 points with a slender victory away at Blackburn. Arjen Robben grabbed the winner after five minutes, drilling under the body of Brad Friedel from 20 yards. Blackburn had their chance to equalise from the spot when Paulo Ferreira tripped Robbie Savage but Petr Cech saved brilliantly from Paul Dickov. The game also saw Cech break Peter Schmeichel's record for the longest run without conceding a Premiership goal. The 22-year-old had only to survive four minutes to hold the record outright and by the time the whistle had gone he had extended it to 781 minutes. It was a lively start for the runaway leaders, with Robben and Damien Duff immediately testing the home defence with their blistering pace down the flanks. It was Dutch destroyer Robben who made the early breakthrough, latching on to an Eidur Gudjohnsen header to turn Ryan Nelson inside out and fire under the body of Friedel from 20 yards. Blackburn took their frustration at conceding out on Robben, Aaron Mokoena's clumsy tackle forcing him off after just 10 minutes, the goalscorer cutting a dejected figure as he trudged off the pitch and down the tunnel. But with Joe Cole on in his place the Blues did not take their foot off the gas, Duff hitting a rocket that forced Friedel to scamper across his line and clutch the ball gratefully to his chest. Blackburn eventually awoke from their slumber with Mokoena drilling over and Andy Todd heading wide before Savage went close twice in a minute, the second a blistering strike that whistled wide with Cech well beaten. On the hour mark the hosts got the perfect opportunity to level, referee Uriah Rennie pointing to the spot after Ferreira was adjudged to have clipped Savage's legs in the box. But Cech was more than equal to Dickov's low spot-kick, sprawling away to get his giant left hand in the way and extend his record further in the process. Dickov was caught up in controversy after the Chelsea defenders were unhappy with him twice leaving his foot in on Cech - once after the penalty - and Dominic Matteo was booked for a reckless lunge on Cole as Blackburn threatened to lose their discipline. Chelsea looked comfortable after the break, settling for soaking up Blackburn pressure and hitting their hosts on the counter-attack. Cole and Frank Lampard both saw efforts fly wide as Chelsea sought to extend their slender advantage, though in truth their rock-solid defence never looked like being breached. Dickov continued to pester and probe and search for anything resembling an opening, but Blackburn were simply not up to the task of penetrating a defence that has now shipped just eight goals in 25 league games. Indeed after a relatively quiet game it was Gudjohnsen who sprang to life as the clock ticked down, first lifting a shot over Friedel and wide and then volleying past the post. Dickov hit a low effort that forced Cech to comfortably gather but Chelsea held on to record their eighth Premiership win in a row.

Blinx sequel purrs nicely Blinx sequel purrs nicely The original Blinx was intended to convert many platform game lovers to Microsoft's then new Xbox console. Its sharp graphics and novel gameplay, with the main character able to pause, slow, rewind and fast-forward time, were meant to lure many fans to the new machine. But poor design meant the game became a very frustrating affair with players often stranded half-way through a level without the required tools to finish. Thankfully, the sequel has fixed many of the original faults. This time around you do not play as Blinx but instead you are given the chance to create two unique cat characters and two pig characters. The character generator is very detailed and a few minutes of tweaking and adjusting will create a unique personality to unleash on the game. As the game progresses you swap between the two rival factions, pig and feline, assuming the role of your created characters. The thrust of the game sees the two factions competing to recover pieces of a missing Time Crystal. As in the original, your feline persona can control time, but this time the pigs get to control space. There are a number of puzzles which require control over time to solve while the pigs can create things such as warps, space bubbles and void traps in order to progress. The control over space and time is achieved through a number of VCR-style icons and is quite intuitive. Annoyingly, the puzzles are a little too obviously flagged up and most gamers will find it more of a chore than a challenge to solve them. The game has also tried to emulate franchises such as Jak and Daxter and Ratchet and Clank on PS2 and so there are a number of combat elements. These are a little predictable and tend to drag the general polish of the game down to a more dulled affair. But the game's excellent graphics, easily the best-looking platform game around, sound and dollops of humour make it an attractive game for younger platform fans. Blinx 2 is out on Xbox now.

Brentford v Southampton Brentford v Southampton Griffin Park Tuesday, 1 March 1945 GMT Barry Knight (Kent) home to Manchester United in the quarter-finals Midfielder Andrew Frampton and striker Deon Burton are both slight doubts with hamstring injuries, but should be fit Saints are missing their entire first-choice midfield of Jamie Redknapp, Graeme Le Saux, Nigel Quashie and David Prutton. Anders Svensson and Matt Oakley are likely replacements with Kevin Phillips also scheduled to start, with Henri Camara rested. - Brentford boss Martin Allen: "After conceding eight goals in our last three matches, I have to admit I'm not very confident. "There's no doubt we're the underdogs and after defending so poorly recently it's not looking good. "Southampton have just drawn with the Premiership champions and that makes our task harder than it was already." - Southampton boss Harry Redknapp: "We know they can give us problems. "Brentford have done well but we are the Premiership side and should have the better players. "Staying in the Premiership is our priority. We want to win, of course we do. We'll battle but if it comes to a football match I think we'll win." KEY MATCH STATS - BRENTFORD are the lowest ranked club left in the FA Cup. They're on their best run in the competition since reaching the quarter-finals for the fourth time in their history 16 years ago. Now they have the carrot of the plum draw in the last eight dangling before them. Victory over Premiership strugglers Southampton, would bring the mighty Manchester United to Griffin Park and a gigantic pay day for the sole League One survivors. - Martin Allen's brave side came back from two goals down at St Mary's to earn a deserved replay. Southampton striker Henri Camara scored twice from close range to put the Saints in command, but Isaiah Rankin hit back just before half time, and Sam Sodje headed past a creaky defence on 58 minutes. - The Londoners have conceded six goals in their two subsequent League outings - three each in losing away to Hartlepool and drawing at home to Sheffield Wednesday. But they haven't lost in six League and Cup games on home turf - winning three and drawing three since the reverse to Torquay on Boxing Day. - SOUTHAMPTON go into this tie on the back of an eventful Premiership match with Arsenal on Saturday. An angry David Prutton pushed referee Alan Wiley after being shown the red card, but his side still came back to draw 1-1. It was Saints' fourth stalemate in succession in all competitions, but didn't lift them out of the relegation zone. The retention of their ever present Premier League status must be the number one priority, irrespective of the rewards that success against Brentford would bring. - Victory here would set up a repeat of the 1976 final, when Saints astounded the football world by defeating Tommy Docherty's Manchester United courtesy of Bobby Stokes' famous winner. They also knocked out the Red Devils in 1991 on penalties in the fourth round. But to write another chapter in their FA Cup history, the Solent side must avoid succumbing to lower division opposition for the first time since Rotherham, from the second level, beat them 2-1 in a third round tie at Millmoor on 16 January 2002. Southampton were last humbled by a club from the third tier six years ago. Fulham were then in the Second Division, when they won a third round replay at Craven Cottage 1-0 on 13 January 1999. - To get to within two matches of a second visit to the Millennium Stadium in three years for the final, Harry Redknapp must guide his side past a club 36 places inferior on the League ladder, and a manager 19 years his junior, who played under him at West Ham.

Britons fed up with net service Britons fed up with net service A survey conducted by PC Pro Magazine has revealed that many Britons are unhappy with their internet service. They are fed up with slow speeds, high prices and the level of customer service they receive. 17% of readers have switched suppliers and a further 16% are considering changing in the near future. It is particularly bad news for BT, the UK's biggest internet supplier, with almost three times as many people trying to leave as joining. A third of the 2,000 broadband users interviewed were fed up with their current providers but this could be just the tip of the iceberg thinks Tim Danton, editor of PC Pro Magazine. "We expect these figures to leap in 2005. Every month the prices drop, and more and more people are trying to switch," he said. The survey found that BT and Tiscali have been actively dissuading customers from leaving by offering them a lower price when they phone up to cancel their subscription. Some readers were offered a price drop just 25p more expensive than that offered by an alternative operator, making it hardly worth while swapping. Other found themselves tied into 12-month contracts. Broadband has become hugely competitive and providers are desperate to hold on to customers. 12% of those surveyed found themselves unable to swap at all. "We discovered a huge variety of problems, but one of the biggest issues is the current supplier withholding the information that people need to give to their new supplier," said Tim Danton, editor of PC Pro. "This breaks the code of practice, but because that code is voluntary there's nothing we or Ofcom can do to help," he said. There is a vast choice of internet service providers in the UK now and an often bewildering array of broadband packages. With prices set to drop even further in coming months Mr Danton advises everyone to shop around carefully. "If you just stick with your current connection then there's every chance you're being ripped off," he warned. Return to results
Cabinet working on âmost equitableâ budget possible Cabinet working on âmost equitableâ budget possible Kenny says health sector remains a priority Taoiseach Enda Kenny at the launch of DCUâs new Centre for Family Business at the Helix, Dublin, yesterday. Photograph: Brian Lawless/PA Wire Taoiseach Enda Kenny has said Ministers are working on the âfairest and most equitableâ budget possible. Speaking on his way into todayâs Cabinet pre-budget meeting, Mr Kenny said there was still a lot of work to do in advance of Tuesdayâs announcements, with âsome very tough decisions to be madeâ even while the forecast expenditure cuts had been reduced from â¬3.1 billion to â¬2.5 billion. The Taoiseach did not comment directly on reports in this morningâs Online News that Minister for Social Protection Joan Burton was looking at cuts to secondary benefits for pensioners and the disabled such as for electricity and telephone allowances, but he said Ministers would âmake the best decisions that they canâ. Minister for Finance Michael Noonan said the Government is finalising details in relation to the health budget in particular. There is still a lack of clarity as to whether there will be a supplementary budget for the health service, which has cost overruns this year estimated at â¬150 million, or whether the overruns will have to be carried over into next yearâs budget. Mr Noonan said the goal of the budget will be to âmaintain the health services and maybe expand them a little bit, but at the same time come under the expenditure ceilings that are requiredâ. Both Minister for Public Expenditure Brendan Howlin and Minister for Health Dr James Reilly and their officials are âworking through various optionsâ in relation to the health department, he revealed. There will be another Cabinet meeting on Sunday. Mr Howlin said they had difficult decisions to make because they were returning to the same measures they had examined âagain and again, year-on-yearâ for savings. âThe choices are narrowing, but we are close down to a final settlement across all Government departments which is fair and reasonable. We have to go through it line-by-line with Cabinet colleagues today. Bit by bit the jigsaw is taking shape and we will be in good shape by Tuesday.â .

Call for action on internet scam Call for action on internet scam Phone companies are not doing enough to warn customers about internet "rogue-dialling" scams, according to premium phone line regulator Icstis. It has received 45,000 complaints in recent months about dial-up internet connections diverting to premium rate numbers without users' knowledge. Phone companies refuse to pay compensation because they say calls must be paid for. They must warn people earlier about possible fraud, Icstis said. People who use dial-up connections can be affected by the scams. Without realising, a program can be downloaded which diverts internet calls via a premium phone line. Victims often fail to notice until they receive an unusually high bill. Icstis spokesman Rob Dwight said: "Phone companies should get in touch with their customers sooner. "If my bill goes over the usual Â£50 a month I want to know about it straight away - I don't want to be told when it's hit Â£750." Phone companies had the systems in place to spot fraudulent activity and artificially-inflated traffic, he said. "We alert them to the numbers that we have under investigation and they should be looking out for these numbers," he added. Telecoms ombudsman Elizabeth France said: "Certainly I would not be surprised to find my credit card company phoning me if I do something out of the ordinary. "So I would expect phone companies to be looking to see if they can have a similar approach." The biggest phone company BT says it is doing what it can to monitor fraud and warn people about rogue dialling. Its advice to customers is to use call barring if they want to prevent calls to premium lines because, under the current system, once the call has been made there's little that can be done. Gavin Patterson, group managing director for BT Consumer, said "We do look at customer's calling patterns and we do make interventions when they are out of the ordinary. "We're looking at the moment at whether we can improve this." But as BT handled 180 million calls a day monitoring was "quite a task in itself", he added. The government has ordered a review of premium line services and is likely to say Icstis should have more power to deal with rogue diallers in future. At the moment, it cannot demand pay-outs on the behalf of customer - it can only close illegal services down. I use free anti-virus software (AVG) and free firewall protection (ZoneAlarm). Both of these tools have prevented unauthorised access and outgoing calls inadvertently and innocently caused by my daughter's love of music sites. How about ISPs informing all customers of such facilities? The responsibility clearly falls with the customer but many fall prey through simply not knowing how to avoid these issues. Ignorance is and always has been an expensive business. Does any one know what happens once this fraud has been committed and recognised? The phone companies pay the people who obtaining money fraudulently, so are these people followed up and prosecuted ? These diallers are mainly downloaded from sites offering illegal MP3s, porn and pirated software. If people didn't visit such sites they'd be considerably less at risk. Whatever happened to personal responsibility? It seems everyone has to be a 'victim' these days! Part of the blame has to rest with the manufacturers of home computer operating systems. A secure system should not allow a web page or email to download and install anything without the user's knowledge. These scams are illegal and telephone companies should have nothing to do with them. They should refuse to pay money over to the perpetrators. Or are they themselves receiving such good returns that it is in their interest to keep the scam going? Why don't BT et al block all premium numbers by default and only turn it off at the customer's request? To anyone who falls foul of this scam - refuse to pay your telephone provider for these calls. After you notify your telephone provider of these fraudulent transactions, they cannot insist on you paying the bill. To do so would be to knowingly assist the fraudsters to commit the fraud. No customers have yet been taken to court for refusing to pay these bills. Disable or remove your modem and use broadband instead - then you have nothing to worry about. Or buy some decent firewall software and anti-virus. You would not walk out in the freezing cold without a coat - you would not drive your car without any insurance - so why not protect your PC? Stop blaming the phone companies - it's not their fault! I was very impressed with our phone company recently. I had kept ringing a hotline number for Kylie tickets and next day they rang back to ask if I was aware there were 40-odd calls to the same number. Great service. And I got the tickets as well! I have a colleague who has fallen victim to this kind of scam. He informed the phone company about it, they subsequently put a block on premium rate numbers. Three months later another huge bill of over Â£1,000 came in - the block apparently didn't work and he still has to pay for it, even though a block was in place. Phone companies are probably quite happy for their customers to be hit with a huge bill, otherwise they'd be taking extra steps to prevent this kind of problem. I have been scammed of Â£139. The operator will do nothing about this and, to add insult to injury, I was charged VAT by the government. Premium rate numbers have been subject to various scams ever since they were invented. One example was where thieves would set up a premium rate number and then dial it day and night from phones whose quarterly bills were never paid. The telephone company was the victim here and you can bet that loophole was blocked very quickly. I know people who have run up large bills, despite being IT-literate. From talking to BT in Belfast, I believe that they will shortly be giving out a free application that can stop you dialling expensive numbers without knowing. It's not the fault of phone companies, and at last they are doing something about it. It's about time that the profiteering by the 'legitimate' phone companies came to an end, mainly by doing away with dial-up altogether and bring broadband down to the same price as dial-up! Not only will this ruin things for the dialler scammers but also allow people to update and upgrade their security more easily and quickly. I haven't "fallen victim to a rogue-dialling scam" but I think you're seriously remiss in not pointing out that the vast majority of these scams arise from people trying to access services purporting to provide free pornography. In most cases the user is entirely at fault, which is probably why the telephone companies are rightly unwilling to refund them. My telephone supplier did not inform me that my monthly bill had risen from its normal Â£3 to Â£5, to Â£320. This was because of the scam. They simply billed me. What particularly galls me, over and above having over Â£300 stolen, is that the supplier and the government (through VAT) are profiting from this crime and will not reimburse me their portion of my losses. How about an automatic monthly cap of say Â£20 on premium rate calls that you would have to contact your provider to have lifted? That way you could use legitimate premium rate numbers while limiting fraudulent usage. At least any disputed amount would be limited, far easier for a telecoms operator to write off Â£20 than it is Â£750. A few years back I was also the target of such scams but thank God I have already upgraded to broadband and nothing was connected to my modem so all I heard was the sound of an attempted connection. How about home users take some responsibility and ensure their anti-virus and firewall software is up to date? That should prevent the vast majority of these scams.

Calls for a strategic investment bank to help small firms Calls for a strategic investment bank to help small firms Ireland must create an environment that facilitates and fosters enterprise, not just in the multinational space, but also for small and medium-sized enterprises, Isme chief executive Eamonn Kielty has said. Speaking at the Isme annual conference in Dublin, Mr Kielty repeated the organisationâs long-standing call for a development fund for the SME sector, saying it would bring some competition into the dangerously concentrated market. âA normal competitive banking market no longer exists in Ireland, and currently the banks are primarily concerned with self-preservation and deleveraging. As foreign banks exit stage left, the remaining bailed-out two will no doubt take advantage of the lack of competition to hike up their charges.â He said the resilience and determination of SMEs is starting to win through, despite the harsh economic headwinds. However, he warned against any premature celebration as Ireland exits the troika bailout, and called for innovative initiatives in public sector costs, bank lending and public procurement. Access to credit Economist Tom Healy supported calls for a strategic investment bank to help small firms, saying access to credit continued to be a huge problem for SMEs. âWe need to leave casino banking to somewhere else outside businesses and households . . . Fixing the banking sector will probably remain the most significant challenge post-troika,â he said. Mr Healy, a director of the Nevin Economic Research Institute , said Ireland could ill-afford to deplete human capital in the long run by not paying attention to skills, adding that the country would not be âout of the woodsâ post-troika. âWe are being moved from intensive care to an ordinary ward where staff are going to continue monitoring our health.â Prof John McHale, chairman of the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council , said Irelandâs debt ratio would have reached almost 160 per cent of GDP, had fiscal adjustments not taken place. âThere is no doubt that austerity slows the economy. The key question is whether austerity is working to stabilise public finances,â he said. Luke Halpin , a sales executive with Surfaccounts, said the mood was on the up for SMEs, with people showing more confidence in the economy. âWe hired six new people this year, so things are looking up.â Anglo Printers director Peter Kieran said he had also noticed an increase in consumer and business sentiment in the past six months. âWe are in sales and are out on the road an awful lot. We see people are spending more money now.â
Campbell rescues Arsenal Campbell rescues Arsenal Sol Campbell proved to be an unlikely match-winner to earn Arsenal a hard-fought win at Portsmouth. The England defender lashed home a 25-yard shot for his first goal in 16 months to take Arsenal back into second spot, five points behind Chelsea. But before Campbell scored the best two chances of the game fell to Pompey striker Ricardo Fuller. In the first half he blasted wide when clear, and his control let him down in the second half when well placed. Portsmouth got plenty of bodies behind the ball to deny Arsenal space in the early stages. But their marking was slack at a corner and Patrick Vieira should have done better when the ball fell to him 16 yards out. A mistake by Arjan de Zeeuw let Thierry Henry in behind the Pompey defence on 17 minutes but as he bore down on goal Linvoy Primus got in a saving tackle. With just Fuller as an out-and-out striker, Portsmouth's shape made life difficult for Arsenal. But a delightful touch by Robin van Persie gave Henry a sight of goal, although the angle was too tight for his shot to trouble Jamie Ashdown. Ashdown caused hearts to flutter on 28 minutes when he missed his punch at a corner and Kolo Toure headed just wide and, as Arsenal began to press, Van Persie blasted over a good opportunity after Henry had set him up. Henry took a quick return pass from Vieira but Ashdown was out quickly to block, and there were some anxious seconds for Pompey as the ball ran loose before Matthew Taylor cleared. After playing second fiddle, Portsmouth should have taken the lead on 34 minutes. Referee Howard Webb played a good advantage to allow Steve Stone to send Gary O'Neil away but, having shrugged off Toure, the Pompey midfielder planted his shot wide from 10 yards. As half-time approached, Henry teased a shot through a ruck of players and inches wide. At the other end, Fuller broke clear but failed to hit the target as Toure closed him down. Fuller was given the best chance of the match so far on 48 minutes when Patrik Berger's break and slipped pass played him clear. But a poor first touch lost him the opportunity and even when he checked back and went down under Vieira's challenge, referee Webb was not interested. Fuller paid the price when he gave way on 55 minutes to Aiyegbeni Yakubu, who returned after six weeks out with a knee injury. But it needed alert reflexes and safe handling from Ashdown to cling on to Van Persie's shot as Henry sniffed for scraps. Portsmouth were growing in confidence and keeper Manuel Almunia had to stand his ground to beat away a powerful shot from Berger. Arsenal were struggling to find their rhythm but took the lead through the unlikely source of Campbell. The England defender needed little invitation as Pompey backed off to stride forward and lash a ferocious shot past Ashdown. Arsenal might have stretched their lead two minutes later when Mathieu Flamini escaped his marker to flash a header wide from Henry's free-kick. Almunia went full length to grab Berger's long-range shot, while Ashdown palmed away substitute Dennis Bergkamp's shot.

Chelsea denied by James heroics Chelsea denied by James heroics A brave defensive display, led by keeper David James, helped Manchester City hold the leaders Chelsea. After a quiet opening, James denied Damien Duff, Jiri Jarosik and Mateja Kezman, while Paul Bosvelt cleared William Gallas' header off the line. Robbie Fowler should have scored for the visitors but sent his header wide. Chelsea had most of the possession in the second half but James kept out Frank Lampard's free-kick and superbly tipped the same player's volley wide. City went into the game with the proud record of being the only domestic team to beat Chelsea this season. And there was little to alarm them in the first 30 minutes as Chelsea - deprived of Arjen Robben and Didier Drogba through injury - struggled to pose much of a threat. Indeed, it was the visitors who looked likelier to enliven a drab opening played at a lethargic pace. Shaun Wright-Phillips - watched by England boss Sven-Goran Eriksson - showed his customary trickery to burst into the right of the area and deliver a dangerous ball, which was blocked by John Terry. But Chelsea suddenly stepped up a gear and created a flurry of chances. First, Duff got round Ben Thatcher and blasted in a shot that James parried to Kezman, who turned the ball wide. Soon afterwards, Jarosik found space in the area to powerfully head Lampard's corner goalwards but James tipped the ball over. Chelsea were now looking more like Premiership leaders and James kept out Kezman's fierce drive before Bosvelt and James combined to clear Gallas' header from Duff's corner. City broke swiftly up the field and the last chance of a frenetic spell should have resulted in Fowler celebrating his 150th Premiership goal. Wright-Phillips raced down the left and crossed to Fowler but City's lone man up front, left free by Terry's slip, contrived to head wide when it seemed a breakthrough was certain. The second half started as quietly as the first, although James was forced to divert a cross from the lively Duff away from Eidur Gudjohnsen's path. There was a nasty moment for Petr Cech, looking for a ninth straight clean sheet in the league, when a series of ricochets saw Fowler chase a loose ball in the area and collide accidently with the Czech Republic stopper. Another quiet spell followed, which Duff interrupted with a surging run that was halted illegally on the edge of the penalty area by Bosvelt. Lampard stepped up to blast a shot through the wall and James somehow blocked it with his legs. Another timely challenge, this time from Richard Dunne in time added on, prevented Gudjohnsen from getting in a shot. There was still time for James to produce a sensational save to tip Lampard's volley round the post.

China 'ripe' for media explosion China 'ripe' for media explosion Asia is set to drive global media growth to 2008 and beyond, with China and India filling the two top spots, analysts have predicted. Japan, South Korea and Singapore will also be strong players, but China's demographics give it the edge, a media conference in London heard. The world's most populous country - population 1.3bn - now has about 200 million middle-class consumers. Forty per cent fall in the key 16 to 35-year-old demographic. As a result, it is attracting huge foreign investment in media and communications, analysts told the Financial Times New Media and Broadcasting Conference last week. Interest in China among international media groups has surged in recent months after Beijing issued rules allowing foreign investment in joint-venture television, radio and film production companies. News Corporation, Viacom and Sony Pictures are among the big names involved in joint ventures with Chinese players. More than 700 million Chinese listen to 1,000 radio stations, while 200 TV stations broadcast 2,900 channels. China Central Television (CCTV), the state broadcaster, claims an audience of more than a billion people. Of the country's 360 million households, 100 million receive cable TV programmes. The rest could be a potential audience for satellite broadcasting which China plans to launch in 2006. The State Administration of Radio, Film and Television (SARFT), which regulates broadcasting, plans to move all programmes to digital by 2015. The continuing roll-out of new digital channels has boosted demand for quality content, creating significant opportunities for both Chinese and foreign content providers. But according to recent reports from China, the authorities have tightened controls over foreign investment in TV production joint ventures. It has limited most foreign companies to only one joint venture and banned the involvement of any found to be "unfriendly", according to reports. The SARFT said: "There is a very strong ideological component to production of broadcast television programmes." It added: "China must understand the political tendencies and background of overseas partners and prevent joint ventures or cooperation from bringing harmful foreign thinking or culture into our production sector." According to the Financial Times' China correspondent, the new rules highlight the political sensitivities that surround foreign involvement in China's media sector. This is despite Beijing's decision to open the state-dominated sector to international investment. As well as traditional broadcasting, Chinese and foreign entrepreneurs alike see fortunes waiting to be made in new media, like mobile services and online gaming. Mobile games already account for 15% of revenues from China's 340 million mobile users. Online gaming sales are predicted to top a billion US dollars next year, according to the UK-based journal Screen Digest. The video market is also seen as a big opportunity, although piracy levels are still very high despite an anti-piracy drive during the past year. In the cinema industry the deployment of digital screens is being accelerated. This is not just to modernise venues but also to curb piracy and regulate distribution. Li Ruigang, president of the commercial broadcaster Shanghai Media Group, told the conference that China's new media market "is already experiencing explosive growth". It was particularly strong in charged broadband services and mobile value-added services. Leading China-watcher, and founder of the CGA consultancy Jeanne-Marie Gescher, agreed that the time was ripe for foreign media groups to tap China's huge media market potential. "China's media are now driven by investors who do not care how people consume media - they just want people to consume more of it," Mrs Gescher concluded. Comments are closed for this article.
City tie on as weather hits games City tie on as weather hits games Oldham Athletic's FA Cup tie against Manchester City will go ahead despite severe weather conditons, which have hit several games across Britain. Fans had to wait until noon for the match to be given the green light after high winds caused structural damage to two of the stands at Boundary Park. On Friday, Burnley's tie against Liverpool was called off due to a waterlogged pitch. Bad weather has also forced several Scottish Cup matches to be postponed. Gretna's tie against Dundee United, Morton's match at Livingston and Airdrie United at Ross County were all called off. Elsewhere in Scotland, Third Division matches between Albion Rovers and Queen's Park and Elgin and Peterhead were also postponed. Comments are closed for this article.
Cole refuses to blame van Persie Cole refuses to blame van Persie Ashley Cole has refused to blame Robin van Persie for leaving Arsenal with no fully-fit strikers for the FA Cup fifth round replay at Sheffield United. Van Persie is suspended alongside Dennis Bergkamp and Jose Antonio Reyes after being sent off at Southampton when Arsenal had a numerical advantage. Thierry Henry is ruled out with an Achilles tendon injury but Cole said: "No-one is putting the blame on Robin. "It's just something that happens on the spur of the moment." Cole added: "I've done it before and I hope they didn't blame me for anything. "Of course he'll learn. I've been sent off a couple of times now and it's just one of those things when you go a bit crazy for one or two seconds. Freddie Ljungberg is likely to be used in an emergency striking role and will be partnered by either Arturo Lupoli, Quincy Owusu-Abeyie or Jeremie Aliadiere. Gunners boss Arsene Wenger said: "Freddie is an option but we need a second striker. "I have to decide whether it will be Aliadiere, Quincy or Lupoli who will start with him up front. Those three will be involved." Arsenal are also without winger Robert Pires, who sustained an ankle injury at St Mary's. Wenger added: "It doesn't look like anything is fractured, but it is a good ankle sprain. "It does not look like Pires will be ready for two to three weeks." Comments are closed for this article.
Credit unions the only Anglo bondholders the Government has faced down Credit unions the only Anglo bondholders the Government has faced down Money that could not be lent out during boom was moved for safety to banks David Drumm and Sean Fitzpatrick of Anglo Irish Bank in 2006. In 2005 the bankâs tracker bond seemed like a prudent and safe investment. Photograph: Alan Betson Why did the State wreck itself to save Anglo Irish Bank , adding the millions to the billions and prayer to shivering prayer? Why did the present government meekly accept that the promissory notes issued to Anglo must be paid at all costs? Because, in the end, it was a matter of principle. A state doesnât default on its debts, even when they are the debts of a sleazy and demented private bank. Except that even this is not true. There is one group of Anglo bondholders who are being royally burned. Are they some cabal of oil sheikhs, so rich that theyâve forgotten their little punt on that mad little Irish bank? Are they Russian oligarchs dozing on the sundecks of their yachts in the Med? No. They are the only Irish financial institutions that havenât disgraced themselves: the credit unions. The one set of Anglo bondholders that Michael Noonan is bravely facing down are the small, decent voluntary organisations that might represent some kind of antidote to the ruthless greed of the banking system. The State that cringes like a seven stone weakling before multi-billionaires who gambled on Anglo is coming over like Charles Atlas with the credit unions who took the same punt. During the boom years, when the banks were begging people to take loans, credit unions were left with cash they couldnât lend out. So they had to put this money into banks. The Central Bank regulations said that they should spread it around different A-rated banks. Up popped A-rated Anglo Irish Bank in 2005 with a custom-made tracker bond. It seemed like a prudent and safe investment: the capital invested was 100 per guaranteed and returns were promised to be at least 12 per cent and potentially as high as 47 per cent. These returns were to be generated by Goldman Sachs. Anglo Irish and Goldman Sachs - what could possibly go wrong? There was a note in the small print that âin the event of Anglo defaulting, the investorâs capital will not be guaranteedâ but in 2005 that was like saying that if aliens landed on Earth, all bets were off. Presumably, the very same note was in the bond contracts signed by billionaire speculators. .

Dairy products push wholesale price index up Dairy products push wholesale price index up Rising cost of dairy and meat products sees marginal rise in price index The cost of dairy products increased by 16.4 per cent in the year to September. Photograph: Jessica Rinaldi/Online News Wholesale prices grew by 0.5 per cent in the year to September 2013, up from a decrease of 1.4 per cent in the previous month, driven by rising dairy and meat products prices. In the month of September, prices decreased by 0.2 per cent compared to a decrease of 2.1 per cent for the same month last year. The most significant changes were increases in printing and reproduction of recorded media (+1.0 per cent), beverages (+0.4 per cent) and dairy products (+0.2 per cent), while there were decreases in other food products including bread and confectionary (-0.8 per cent). On an annual basis the most significant changes were an increase in dairy products (+16.4 per cent); meat and meat products (+3.8 per cent); and computer, electronic and optical products (+1.8 per cent), while there were decreases in other food products including bread and confectionary (-3.3 per cent), and chemicals and chemical products (-1.9 per cent). Energy prices fell by 2.7 per cent in the year to September 2013, with petroleum fuels down by 5 per cent. In September however, energy prices increased by 4 per cent. In the building and construction sector, all material prices increased by 1.6 per cent in the year, driven by notable increases in stone (+8 per cent); glass (+5.7 per cent); and PVC pipes and fittings (+4.6 per cent).

Digital UK driven by net and TV Digital UK driven by net and TV The UK's adoption of digital TV and broadband has helped make it the fourth most digitally-savvy nation in Europe, according a report by Jupiter Research. But the UK still lags in terms of broadband speeds compared to others. The most digitally sophisticated Europeans, in terms of use of digital goods such as mobiles, TV, net and cameras, are the Scandinavians. About 14 million households in the UK, 60%, have digital TV, according to the communications regulator Ofcom. The least digital of the European nations was Greece, in 17th position, according to the Digital Life Index. Scandinavian countries Sweden, Denmark and Norway came out top in the report, but there were some differences in technology trends. "The European Digital Life Index demonstrates that digital lifestyles are common today, but across Europe there is no single digital lifestyle," said Nate Elliott, Jupiter analyst. "Consumers adopt different digital products and services in different countries." Although there are differences between different European nations, the gap between them is closing, the report concluded. The trend for gadgets and technologies, such as digital video recorders (DVR), broadband, and video-on-demand will continue across Europe, he added. More than six million UK households now have broadband net. By the middle of 2005, it is estimated that 50% of all UK net users will be on broadband. Cable company NTL is trialling faster ADSL (Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line) broadband technology using ADSL2+ which can give speeds of 18Mbps compared to current speeds which are usually around 1Mbps or 2Mbps. BT is set to trial the technology later in the year. Super-fast broadband will be necessary to the delivery of services such as high-definition TV (HDTV) and video-on-demand, already very popular in France and other European countries. A separate survey by GMIPoll last week found that, globally, people's appetite for technology and gadgets continues unabated. The poll of 20,000 people in 20 countries found that 59% wanted more technology. The computer was the "must-have" gadget for most people (75%). The TV took second place (67%), while the mobile was ranked in third position with 54%. Digital cameras were the most popular choice of gadget for 2005, said the survey, with nearly 40% choosing this over wireless, home printing and DVR technologies. However, only 25% of Britons said a digital camera would be their top gadget purchase of the year. Almost a quarter, 22%, said they would be buying some sort of wireless device. Forty-four percent said they would be buying something "other". This might include digital music players, or gaming devices. The Nintendo DS, Sony's PSP and Gizmondo all hit the shops in 2005, and the first of the next generation of games consoles, Xbox 2, is set to launch later this year. Jupiter Research's index is calculated using 40 different variables across net users, digital TV adoption, wireless and mobile, online activity, and digital devices. Return to results
Disney backs Sony DVD technology Disney backs Sony DVD technology A next generation DVD technology backed by Sony has received a major boost. Film giant Disney says it will produce its future DVDs using Sony's Blu-ray Disc technology, but has not ruled out a rival format developed by Toshiba. The two competing DVD formats, Blu-ray developed by Sony and others, and Toshiba's HD-DVD, have been courting top film studios for several months. The next generation of DVDs promise very high quality pictures and sound, as well as a lot of data. Both technologies use a blue laser to write information. It has a shorter wavelength so more data can be stored. Disney is the latest studio to announce which technology it is backing in a format battle which mirrors the 1980s Betamax versus VHS war. Sony lost out to JVC in that fight. The current battle for Hollywood's hearts and minds is a crucial one because high-definition films will bring in billions of revenue and the studios would prefer to use one standard. Last month, Paramount, Universal and Warner Brothers said they were opting for the Toshiba and NEC-backed format, HD-DVD high-definition discs. Those studios currently produce about 45% of DVD content. Sony Pictures Entertainment and MGM Studios have already staked their allegiance with the Blu-ray Disc Association, whose members also include technology companies Dell, Samsung and Matsushita. Twentieth Century Fox is still to announce which technology it will be supporting. If Fox decided to go with Blu-ray too, it would mean the format would have a 47% share of DVD content. Disney said its films would be available on the Blu-ray format when DVD players for the standard went on sale on North America and Japan, expected in 2006. Universal is to start producing films on the HD-DVD format in 2005, and Paramount will start releasing titles using the standard in 2006. Toshiba expects sales of HD-DVDs to reach 300bn yen ($2.9bn, Â£1.5bn) by 2010. Return to results
Doctor critical of quality of clinical notes Doctor critical of quality of clinical notes Dr Peter Boylan former master of The National Maternity Hospital at the inquest into the death of Savita Halappanavar. âThe notes on the morning of October 24th, following the ward round, are of poor quality, retrospective and not really helpful in understanding the sequence of events, â he said. Dr Peter Boylan , the second expert witness to give evidence to the inquest into the death of Savita Halappanavar , brought further clarity to the events leading to her death last October at University Hospital Galway. A consultant obstetrician and gynaecologist and former master at the National Maternity Hospital (NMH), Dublin, Dr Boylan initially provided background information on sepsis in pregnancy. In a recent major report, infection in the genital tract became the leading cause of direct maternal death in the UK for the first time since the confidential inquiries into maternal deaths commenced in 1952. Despite this, he said the mortality rate from maternal sepsis remains low, at about one per 100,000 maternities. Similar figures apply in the Republic; in the past 25 years during which more than 210,000 women gave birth in the NMH, there were two deaths from sepsis. Significantly, the UK report referred to by Dr Boylan, who is clinical director at the NMH, warns that progression from sepsis to severe sepsis to septic shock can be rapid. For many healthcare workers, it notes, this means âthe fulminating nature of many of the cases is surprising and shocking when it does happen.â In his analysis of Ms Halappanavarâs case, the expert witness noted that on Tuesday, October 23rd, the patient was stable and her life was not at risk. âTermination of pregnancy was therefore not a practical, legal proposition on the 23rd,â he said. Deteriorated Her condition deteriorated overnight and in his opinion, she developed clinical signs of chorioamnionitis (infection of the foetal membranes) early on Wednesday. By the time of her consultantâs ward round at about 8.25am on October 24th, there was âa developing real and substantial riskâ to Ms Halappanavarâs life. Dr Boylan was notably critical of the patientâs care on the Wednesday morning. Her blood pressure dropped progressively from 7.50am when the reading was 100/75 to 10.30am when it was 84/50 to 13.00 hours when it had dropped to 73/38. He questioned why no doctor was informed of the pressure deterioration during this five-hour period. He was also critical of the quality of the clinical notes that morning. âPoor-qualityâ notes âThe notes on the morning of October 24th, following the ward round, are of poor quality, retrospective and not really helpful in understanding the sequence of events.â he said. Dr Boylan was forthright about how unhelpful the law on abortion is when an obstetrician is dealing with a case such as Savitaâs. He referred to a legal vacuum that hampers a consultantâs professional practice. It is clearly his view that without the legal and ethical constraints that doctors must work under, Ms Halappanavar could have been offered a termination on either the Monday or Tuesday of her admission and that this could have saved her life. In addition, he was of the view that from 9.30am on Wednesday, a termination would not have affected the eventual outcome, primarily because Ms Halappanavar became critically ill in such a short space of time. Now that we have heard from two key expert witnesses, what conclusions are emerging from this inquest? There were deficiencies in Ms Halappanavarâs clinical care, according to both Dr Boylan and Dr Susan Knowles, consultant microbiologist. These included a failure to take and record the patientâs vital signs consistently, poor note-keeping and a delay in alerting medical staff to a precipitous fall in her blood pressure on the Wednesday.

Doctorsâ strike to go ahead after failure of last-minute talks Doctorsâ strike to go ahead after failure of last-minute talks IMO says members will provide the equivalent of a Sunday service tomorrow A strike by non-consultant hospital doctors is to go ahead tomorrow after the failure of last-minute talks between the Irish Medical Organisation and the HSE to avert it. Hospitals have cancelled outpatient appointments and elective surgery planned for tomorrow. The strike is expected to affect up to 15,000 patients. HSE management instructed senior staff on Friday to reactivate previously prepared contingency arrangements for the strike. The Labour Relations Commission made informal contact with the parties last Friday see if doctors were prepared to return to the negotiating table but the IMO repeated its view that there was no point in this because of the breakdown in trust with the HSE. HSE director of acute hospitals Ian Carter then wrote to the heads of hospital groups telling them to communicate directly with patients whose appointments on Tuesday will be affected. Mr Carter said patients should be given a new date for their appointment where possible. Hospital managers have also been told to contact local union representatives in order to ascertain which services will continue to be provided as normal. The IMO has said members will provide the equivalent of a Sunday service on Tuesday but that emergency, oncology and dialysis services would not be affected. IMO assistant director of industrial relations Eric Young said the time had come for action because the HSE had failed to provide a detailed and satisfactory response to its proposals on the issue of long working hours for NCHDs. While the Minister for Health James Reilly and the HSE said little separated the sides, Mr Young insisted there was âquite a differenceâ between the IMO and the HSE. The key issue relates to the imposition of sanctions in cases where hospitals fail to limit shifts to a maximum of 24 hours. Return to results

Doors open at biggest gadget fair Doors open at biggest gadget fair Thousands of technology lovers and industry experts have gathered in Las Vegas for the annual Consumer Electronics Show (CES). The fair showcases the latest technologies and gadgets that will hit the shops in the next year. About 50,000 new products will be unveiled as the show unfolds. Microsoft chief Bill Gates is to make a pre-show keynote speech on Wednesday when he is expected to announce details of the next generation Xbox. The thrust of this year's show will be on technologies which put people in charge of multimedia content so they can store, listen to, and watch what they want on devices any time, anywhere. About 120,000 people are expected to attend the trade show which stretches over more than 1.5 million square feet. Highlights will include the latest trends in digital imaging, storage technologies, thinner flat screen and high-definition TVs, wireless and portable technologies, gaming, and broadband technologies. The show also includes several speeches from key technology companies such as Intel, Microsoft, and Hewlett Packard among others. "The story this year remains all about digital and how that is completely transforming and revolutionising products and the way people interact with them," Jeff Joseph, from the Consumer Electronics Association (CEA) told the Online News News website. "It is about personalisation - taking your MP3 player and creating your own playlist, taking your digital video recorder and watch what you want to watch when - you are no longer at the whim of the broadcasters." Consumer electronics and gadgets had a phenomenal year in 2004, according to figures released by CES organisers, the CEA, on Tuesday. The gadget explosion signalled the strongest growth yet in the US in 2004. Shipments of consumer electronics rose by almost 11% between 2003 and 2004. That trend is predicted to continue, according to CEA analysts, with wholesale shipments of consumer technologies expected to grow by 11% again in 2005. The fastest-growing technologies in 2004 included blank DVD media, Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) TVs, digital video recorders (DVRs), and portable music players. "This year we will really begin to see that come to life in what we call place shifting - so if you have your PVR [personal video recorder] in your living room, you can move that content around the house. "Some exhibitors will be showcasing how you can take that content anywhere," said Mr Joseph. He said the products which will be making waves in the next year will be about the "democratisation" of content - devices and technologies that will give people the freedom to do more with music, video, and images. There will also be more focus on the design of technologies, following the lead that Apple's iPod made, with ease of use and good looks which appeal to a wider range of people a key concern. The CEA predicted that there would be several key technology trends to watch in the coming year. Gaming would continue to thrive, especially on mobile devices, and would reach out to more diverse gamers such as women. Games consoles sales have been declining, but the launch of next generation consoles, such as Microsoft's Xbox and PlayStation, could buoy up sales. Although it has been widely predicted that Mr Gates would be showcasing the new Xbox, some media reports have cast doubt on what he would be talking about in the keynote. Some have suggested the announcement may take place at the Games Developers Conference in the summer instead. With more than 52% of US homes expected to have home networks, the CEA suggested hard drive boxes - or media servers - capable of storing thousands of images, video and audio files to be accessed through other devices around the home, will be more commonplace. Portable devices that combine mobile telephony, digital music and video players, will also be more popular in 2005. Their popularity will be driven by more multimedia content and services which will let people watch and listen to films, TV, and audio wherever they are. This means more storage technologies will be in demand, such as external hard drives, and flash memory like SD cards. CES runs officially from 6 to 9 January. Return to results
Dr Muiris Houston writes... Dr Muiris Houston writes... Humans get malaria from the bite of a malaria-infected mosquito. The insects feed on blood, and when a mosquito bites an infected person it then carries the malaria bug. If the mosquito bites again, the parasites are passed on. The parasites, called plasmodium, then travel to the personâs liver, where they multiply, before entering red blood cells; it is at this stage the person begins to feel unwell. This generally happens after two to three weeks, depending on the type of malaria but it can take up to nine months. The red blood cells burst and the parasites attack other red blood cells. At the same time, toxins from the parasite are released into the blood, making the person feel unwell. Individualised treatment There are a number of types of plasmodium parasite, each of which are prominent in different areas in the world. In addition, different areas are associated with resistance to some anti-malarial drugs. So treatment must be individualised to include factors such as local malaria species, patterns of anti-malarial drug resistance and the personal medical history of the patient. One of the treatment options is the drug mefloquine, sold under the brand names Lariam, Mephaquin or Mefliam. It is not the drug of choice; in areas where there is no treatment resistance, oral chloroquine is usually recommended. For plasmodium falciparum infections (or if the exact type cannot be identified), acquired in areas with chloroquine resistance, four treatment options are available. The first two are atovaquone-proguanil and orartemether-lumefantrine. Both of these are quite effective. Quinine sulphate plus the antibiotics doxycycline, tetracycline, or clindamycin is the next treatment alternative. The fourth option, mefloquine, is associated with side-effects including potentially severe neuropsychiatric reactions. Lariam use has recently been banned by the US army. Originally popular because of its once-weekly dosage regimen, it has always been associated with liver and heart problems. One of its most common side-effects is excessive sleepiness â a problem for anyone driving or operating machinery. But the biggest concerns have arisen around its association with paranoia, hallucinations, severe anxiety, depression and suicidal ideation. It now seems these side-effects can persist for months after treatment. While Lariam continues to have a role to play in the treatment of malaria, the risk-to-benefit ratio must be carefully calculated for each patient. Comments are closed for this article.
ECB rules out backstop funding for Ireland without conditions ECB rules out backstop funding for Ireland without conditions Country âmay find solution on its own,â says Asmussen ECB executive board member JÃ¶rg Asmussen said yesterday that any further assistance to Ireland, if granted, would come with conditions imposed by the ESM bailout fund. Photograph: Ralph Orlowski/Online News The European Central Bank has dismissed the idea of no-strings-attached funding to ease Irelandâs return to financial markets. ECB executive board member JÃ¶rg Asmussen said yesterday that any further assistance to Ireland , if granted, would come with conditions imposed by the ESM bailout fund. âIt could well be that the Irish will find a solution on their own,â he told the BÃ¶rsenzeitung financial daily. Confirming he had read recent comments by Minister for Finance Michael Noonan about the possibility of a â¬10 billion precautionary credit line from the bailout fund, Mr Asmussen added: âHe knows that a precautionary ESM programme comes with conditions.â Mr Asmussen said Ireland would not automatically qualify for the ECBâs OMT bond-buying programme â another proposed financial backstop to reassure investors ahead of Irelandâs return to markets. The ECB official said the rules for activating the as-yet untouched OMT programme were known: a country needs to be an ESM programme country with IMF involvement. âThis can also be a precautionary programme with the possibility of primary market purchases by the ESM,â he said, âbut particularly important, and weâve always repeated this, is that a country under an EFSF or ESM programme has to be in a position to win full access to capital markets.â The ECB would not accept short-term debt obligations, so-called treasury bills (T-bills) as proof of financing. Capital markets âOMT is a finance market instrument, not a replacement for the lack of access to capital markets.â Asked whether OMT could be employed to assist capital market returns of programme countries, Mr Asmussen said the bankâs governing council would âdecide on a case-by-case basisâ. Last week ECB president Mario Draghi said a decision on Irelandâs request would be taken âin due timeâ and would be decided by euro zone finance ministers. Return to results
ECB warns of danger from Federal Reserveâs policy shift ECB warns of danger from Federal Reserveâs policy shift US decision to scale back stimulus is a potential threat to euro zone economy, says European Central Bank The ECB said the risks to the eurozoneâs financial system from outside the currency bloc had grown since May. Photograph: Online News/Lisi Niesner The European Central Bank yesterday issued a warning of the threat posed by the scaling back of monetary stimulus in the US. It called on the currency blocâs policymakers to prepare for the ill effects of Federal Reserve tapering. The ECB said in its latest financial stability report that the risks to the euro zoneâs financial system from outside the currency bloc had grown since May on the back of the Federal Reserveâs talk of tapering its $85 billion worth of monthly bond purchases, despite a general improvement in market conditions. âStarting in May, there was a significant repricing in global bond markets, which took place largely because of changing monetary policy expectations in the United States â with increased foreign exchange market volatility and stress borne largely by emerging market economies,â the ECB said. The ECB warned that, while the euro zoneâs institutional investors were more exposed to bond markets than the regionâs lenders, it was difficult to know where the risks of ultimate losses were greatest. âIt cannot be ruled out that ultimate exposures are concentrated among a limited number of entities which may now be more vulnerable to any further severe market shock,â the ECB said. Insurance companies âSuch losses are potentially compounded by an environment of historically low prevailing yields in some countries, which continues to constitute a risk for institutional investors such as insurance companies.â The ECB said weak bank profitability and persistent financial fragmentation still presented a threat to stability. Banking union would be âan important contributionâ to resolving these hurdles. â Latest Economy Return to results
Edu describes tunnel fracas Edu describes tunnel fracas Arsenal's Edu has lifted the lid on the scenes that followed Manchester United's win over the Gunners. The Brazilian confirmed tempers had flared but could shed no light on reports that food was thrown at United boss Sir Alex Ferguson. "I saw people being pulled apart, people pushing, pointing and shouting," he told Uefa's official website. "The United players were trying to wind us up about the result but I didn't see any soup being thrown at anyone." However, Edu tried to play down the incidents, adding: "There was nothing that I haven't seen in Brazilian derbies. "Derby matches in Brazil are worse. I like to play in games like this with this intense rivalry." But Edu was highly critical of the ferocity of some of United's challenges during the game, particularly on Jose Antonio Reyes. "I think we were a lot fairer in the tackles than United," he said. "Reyes was being kicked all over the park - they were beating up the boy and Gary Neville was tackling in such a way that he should have been sent off." Following the game, the Football Association said it would look into events in the tunnel. It also charged Ruud van Nistelrooy with serious foul play while Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger has been asked to explain comments he made about the referee. Comments are closed for this article.
End of austerity budgets may be as early as 2015 End of austerity budgets may be as early as 2015 âBy 2017, 2018, we should be in a position to raise expenditure,â says McHale Prof John McHale: âBased on the best guesses at the moment, the difficult phase should be over after 2015, against possibly 2016. 2016 could be a neutral year. That would be our best guess.â The Irish Fiscal Advisory Council believes the long line of major austerity budgets will come an end in 2015 or 2016, with the possibility opening up by 2017 or 2018 of an expansion in public expenditure. Setting out risks to the recovery scenario, council chairman Prof John McHale said the difficult phase of fiscal adjustment should be complete by 2015 or the following year. âBy 2017, 2018, we should be in a position to actually raise expenditure as well. Choice would have to be made [as to] how to take those gains,â he told reporters. Warning, however, that lower growth generally and a prolonged balance sheet recession still posed a danger, he said it could not discounted the period of very disappointing growth would continue for longer than thought. âBased on the best guesses at the moment, the difficult phase should be over after 2015, against possibly 2016. 2016 could be a neutral year. That would be our best guess.â Prof McHale was speaking as the council published its Fiscal Assessment Report, which said very significant risks remain. âItâs important that that progress that we have noted in achieving sustainability is reinforced,â he said. Debt reduction âItâs important to continue with deficit and debt reduction, with the credibility of that fiscal stance underpinned by compliance with the fiscal rules. The new medium-term economic plan provides an opportunity to lay out the next phase of the fiscal strategy.â Noting the Department of Finance projects that real gross domestic product growth will rise next year to 2 per cent from 0.2 per cent in 2013, the council said growth this year is being depressed by a number of factors. âThese include a background of ongoing balance sheet repair, budgetary consolidation and weak demand in Irelandâs main trading partners. The pharmaceuticals âpatent cliffâ is also reducing the growth of net exports. Uncertainties relating to these elements mean that risks to the forecasts are tilted to the downside for 2014.â Prof McHale said the council took issue with the department over public confusion created on the size of the retrenchment in Budget 2014. He noted the Government took the benefit of â¬600 million in âadditional resources and savingsâ to cite a total retrenchment of â¬3.1 billion in some quarters. However, these were âjust savingsâ and did not constitute permanent budget consolidation effort. Adjustment ambiguity Based on âstandard measuresâ, the council said the actual adjustment was â¬2.5 billion as set out by Minister for Finance Michael Noonan on budget day. âIt was unfortunate that that confusion was allowed to exist ,â said Prof McHale. âWe do chide the Department of Finance for allowing that confusion to exist and call for a much clearer statement on the actual size of the budgetary adjustment in future budgets.â Calling for self-protection against loss of market access in the post-bailout period, he emphasised the value of good debt-maturity management and holdings of cash reserves. âWe did publicly give our advice that we thought, at least from an economics perspective, that a precautionary credit line would have been a valuable additional layer of protection complementing the cash management and debt-maturity management policies . . . âI think you wouldnât want to exaggerate the benefits of a precautionary credit line in reducing risk, but it does give just one further layer of protection that we keep our borrowing costs low. But . . . European politics was also at play and clearly there was uncertainty as to what would happen after an application had been made and the Government decisions.â Had the Government taken a reasonable decision? âI would say yes it probably was a reasonable decision . . . But again, we havenât changed our view that . . . for a precautionary credit line the benefits would have outweighed the costs .â Latest Economy Comments are closed for this article.
Enterprise Ireland plays down internal audit criticism Enterprise Ireland plays down internal audit criticism Fianna FÃ¡il jobs spokesman Dara Calleary says he will raise reports in the Oireachtas Fianna FÃ¡ilâs spokesperson on jobs Dara Calleary said yesterday he intended to raise in the Oireachtas the contents of three internal audit reports criticising Enterprise Ireland. Photograph: Sam Boal/Photocall Ireland Enterprise Irelandâs internal auditors have not identified any sums of money owed to it by grant-receiving companies that relocated Irish jobs overseas, a spokesman for the State agency has said. Speaking on RTÃâs This Week programme yesterday, Fianna FÃ¡il spokesman on jobs Dara Calleary said he intended to raise in the Oireachtas the contents of three internal audit reports criticising the agency. The reports, obtained by RTÃ under the Freedom of Information Act, highlight a case where financial support was given to a company to create jobs in Kilkenny, but some of the posts ended up located in Australia and Bulgaria . âNo proof of location of employee was sought or confirmed,â the audit team noted. The agency spokesman said this particular company was actually exceeding its job expansion targets in the Republic, and that the case was âopenâ, meaning its normal external reviews were not yet due to take place. He said it was standard practice for multinationals to move particular employees to different countries, but under the rules of the grant system the expectation would be that the post for which the grant was awarded would remain in Ireland. He said Enterprise Ireland has regularly clawed back grants from companies that subsequently relocated jobs that should have remained in Ireland 50 companies The Job Expansion Scheme, the largest budget scheme the auditors examined, provided almost â¬6 million to more than 50 companies in 2012. The auditors also highlighted issues with a â¬1.3 million scheme aimed at linking graduates and companies, with one unpublished report finding âthe approach to scoring applicant companies lacked transparency and was poorly structured and controlledâ. Auditors found âseveral instances where relatively low scoring applicants were successful and where some high scoring applicants were rejectedâ. This was a pilot scheme, run on a competitive basis with country-by-country quotas, the spokesman said. Some companies from the UK that scored highly were rejected, while companies from countries with fewer applicants were more likely to be approved. Return to results
Estimate for growth next year trimmed to 1.8 per cent Estimate for growth next year trimmed to 1.8 per cent Germanyâs leading economic institutes halved their 2013 growth forecast for Europeâs largest economy to 0.4 per cent today, citing a significant downturn in industrial production during the winter. The institutes, whose analysis flows into the German governmentâs own economic forecasts, also trimmed their estimate for growth next year to 1.8 per cent, down from the 1.9 per cent they had predicted in April. âThe German economy is on the cusp of an upturn which will be driven by domestic demand,â they said in a statement. Exports will increase modestly thanks to stronger global growth while imports will get a big boost from domestic demand, meaning that foreign trade will probably drag on growth, they added.

Europe backs digital TV lifestyle Europe backs digital TV lifestyle How people receive their digital entertainment in the future could change, following the launch of an ambitious European project. In Nice last week, the European Commission announced its Networked & Electronic Media (NEM) initiative. Its broad scope stretches from the way media is created, through each of the stages of its distribution, to its playback. The Commission wants people to be able to locate the content they desire and have it delivered seamlessly, when on the move, at home or at work, no matter who supplies the devices, network, content, or content protection scheme. More than 120 experts were in Nice to share the vision of interconnected future and hear pledges of support from companies such as Nokia, Intel, Philips, Alcatel, France Telecom, Thomson and Telefonica. It might initially appear to be surprising that companies in direct competition are keen to work together. But again and again, speakers stated they could not see incompatible, stand-alone solutions working. A long-term strategy for the evolution and convergence of technologies and services would be required. The European Commission is being pragmatic in its approach. They have identified that many groups have defined the forms of digital media in the areas that NEM encompasses. The NEM approach is to take a serious look at what is available and what is in the pipeline, pick out the best, bring them together and identify where the gaps are. Where it finds holes, it will develop standards to fill them. What is significant is that such a large and powerful organisation has stated its desire for digital formats to be open to all and work on any gadget. This is bound to please, if not surprise, many individuals and user organisations who feel that the wishes of the holder of rights to content are normally considered over and above those of the consumer. Many feel that the most difficult and challenging area for the Commission will be to identify a solution for different Digital Rights Management (DRM) schemes. Currently DRM solutions are incompatible, locking certain types of purchased content, making them unplayable on all platforms. With the potential of having a percentage of every media transaction that takes place globally, the prize for being the supplier of the world's dominant DRM scheme is huge. Although entertainment is an obvious first step, it will encompass the remote provisions of healthcare, energy efficiency and control of the smart home. The 10-year plan brings together the work of many currently running research projects that the EC has been funding for a number of years.

Exporters capitalising on weak euro instead of soaring deutschmark Exporters capitalising on weak euro instead of soaring deutschmark The US embassy next to the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin. Germans are enraged by a US treasury report which says Germanyâs huge trading surplus is harmful, creating âa deflationary bias for the euro area, as well as for the world economyâ. Photograph: Sean Gallup/Getty Images German officials are furious at America, and not just because of the business about Angela Merkelâs cell phone. What has them enraged now is one (long) paragraph in a US treasury report on foreign economic and currency policies. In that paragraph treasury argues that Germanyâs huge surplus on current account â a broad measure of the trade balance â is harmful, creating âa deflationary bias for the euro area, as well as for the world economyâ. The Germans angrily pronounced this argument âincomprehensibleâ. âThere are no imbalances in Germany which require a correction of our growth-friendly economic and fiscal policy,â declared a spokesman for the nationâs finance ministry. Disturbing But treasury was right, and the German reaction was disturbing. For one thing it was an indicator of the continuing refusal of policymakers in Germany, in Europe more broadly, and, for that matter, around the world to face up to the nature of our economic problems. For another it demonstrated Germanyâs unfortunate tendency to respond to any criticism of its economic policies with cries of victimisation. First, the facts. Remember the China syndrome, in which Asiaâs largest economy kept running enormous trade surpluses thanks to an undervalued currency? Well, China is still running surpluses, but they have declined. Meanwhile, Germany has taken Chinaâs place: last year Germany, not China, ran the worldâs biggest current account surplus. And measured as a share of GDP, Germanyâs surplus was more than twice as large as Chinaâs. Now, itâs true that Germany has been running big surpluses for almost a decade. At first, however, these surpluses were matched by large deficits in southern Europe, financed by large inflows of German capital. Europe as a whole continued to have roughly balanced trade. Then came the crisis, and flows of capital to Europeâs periphery collapsed. The debtor nations were forced â in part at Germanyâs insistence â into harsh austerity, which eliminated their trade deficits. Trade imbalances But something went wrong. The narrowing of trade imbalances should have been symmetric, with Germanyâs surpluses shrinking along with the debtorsâ deficits. Instead, however, Germany failed to make any adjustment at all; deficits in Spain, Greece, and elsewhere shrank, but Germanyâs surplus didnât. This was a very bad thing for Europe because Germanyâs failure to adjust magnified the cost of austerity. Take Spain, the biggest deficit country before the crisis. It was inevitable that Spain would face lean years as it learned to live within its means. It was not, however, inevitable that Spanish unemployment would be almost 27 per cent, and youth unemployment almost 57 per cent. And Germanyâs immovability was an important contributor to Spainâs pain. It has also been a bad thing for the rest of the world. Itâs simply arithmetic: since southern Europe has been forced to end its deficits while Germany hasnât reduced its surplus, Europe as a whole is running large trade surpluses, helping to keep the world economy depressed. German officials, as weâve seen, respond to all of this with angry declarations that German policy has been impeccable. Sorry, but (a) this doesnât matter, and (b) it isnât true. Why doesnât it matter? Five years after the fall of Lehman the world economy is still depressed, suffering from a persistent shortage of demand. In this environment a country that runs a trade surplus is, to use the old phrase, beggaring its neighbours. Itâs diverting spending away from their goods and services to its own, and thereby taking away jobs. It doesnât matter whether itâs doing this maliciously or with the best of intentions, itâs doing it all the same. Furthermore, as it happens, Germany isnât blameless. It shares a currency with its neighbours, greatly benefiting German exporters, who get to price their goods in a weak euro instead of what would surely have been a soaring deutschmark. Yet Germany has failed to deliver on its side of the bargain: to avoid a European depression it needed to spend more as its neighbours were forced to spend less, and it hasnât done that. German officials wonât, of course, accept any of this. They consider their country a shining role model, to be emulated by all, and the awkward fact that we canât all run gigantic trade surpluses simply doesnât register. Food stamps And the thing is itâs not just the Germans. Germanyâs trade surplus is damaging for the same reason cutting food stamps and unemployment benefits in the US destroys jobs â and Republican politicians are about as receptive as German officials to anyone who points out their error. In the sixth year of a global economic crisis, whose essence is that there isnât enough spending, many policymakers still donât get it. And it looks as if they never will. .

For the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI), the Government is taking a calculated gamble ... For the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI), the Government is taking a calculated gamble with its decision to make savings of â¬2.5 billion in the 2014 budget, rather than honour the â¬3.1 billion figure agreed with the troika of lenders, as part of the bailout programme. In its latest quarterly report, the ESRI points out that Ireland to date has met all the fiscal targets set in the programme. And it has done so by underpromising and overdelivering â by surpassing market expectations. This cautious and prudent strategy has paid off, and delivered a tangible financial dividend. Irelandâs reputation with international lenders has been greatly enhanced as a result of the progress already made in stabilising the economy. The Stateâs borrowing costs have fallen sharply. And the National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA) has made a successful return to the capital markets earlier this year, where it secured new funding at attractive rates. The worry now is that the Government may overpromise and underdeliver at a critical time, as Ireland is about to leave the bailout programme. Assuming the Government does leave the programme, the economy will face much closer scrutiny by bond market investors, on whom the Government depends to finance sizeable budget deficits. The ESRI is clearly fearful the Government may miss its fiscal targets for next year. If so, those austerity measures now deferred would instead have to be introduced in next yearâs budget. That would damage hopes of a sustained economic recovery, and weaken national morale. Much, however, depends on whether the Government achieves its growth forecasts for 2014. Despite its reservations about the Governmentâs proposed fiscal adjustment, the ESRI nevertheless presents an optimistic assessment of Irelandâs economic prospects, noting some encouraging signs of recovery. Rising employment and falling unemployment are seen as the âclearest signalâ of the economyâs slow rebound. Where the institute forecasts an unemployment rate of 13 per cent in 2014, the Department of Finance estimate is for a slightly lower number. Either way, the trend is positive and marks a steady decline from the 14.7 per cent peak figure in 2012. Lower unemployment means a reduction in the social welfare bill, while rising employment boosts tax revenues. And as consumers start to spend more, greater signs of public confidence in economic recovery are increasingly evident. Nevertheless, as a small open economy, Ireland remains hugely reliant on international growth to underpin national recovery. Our economic prospects in 2014 will partly be determined by next weekâs budgetary choices, but largely by what happens in the world economy, and by how fast it grows. .

Freeze on anti-spam campaign Freeze on anti-spam campaign A campaign by Lycos Europe to target spam-related websites appears to have been put on hold. Earlier this week the company released a screensaver that bombarded the sites with data to try to bump up the running costs of the websites. But the site hosting the screensaver now displays a pink graphic and the words "Stay tuned". No one at Lycos was available for comment on latest developments in its controversial anti-spam campaign. Lycos Europe's "Make love not spam" campaign was intended as a way for users to fight back against the mountain of junk mail flooding inboxes. People were encouraged to download the screensaver which, when their PC was idle, would then send lots of data to sites that peddle the goods and services mentioned in spam messages. Lycos said the idea was to get the spam sites running at 95% capacity and generate big bandwidth bills for the spammers behind the sites. But the plan has proved controversial. Monitoring firm Netcraft analysed response times for some of the sites targeted by the screensaver and found that a number were completely knocked offline. The downing of the sites could dent Lycos claims that what it is doing does not amount to a distributed denial of service attack. In such attacks thousands of computers bombard sites with data in an attempt to overwhelm them. Laws in many countries do not explicitly outlaw such attacks but many nations are re-drafting computer use laws to make them specific offences. Lycos Europe now appears to have put the plan on hold. The site hosting the screensaver currently shows a holding page, with the words, "Stay tuned". The numerical internet address of the site has also changed. This is likely to be in response to spammers who have reportedly redirected traffic from their sites back to the Lycos screensaver site. The campaign has come under fire from some corners of the web. Many discussion groups have said that it set a dangerous precedent and could incite vigilantism. "Attacking a spammer's website is like poking a grizzly bear sleeping in your back garden with a pointy stick," said Graham Cluley, senior technology consultant for Sophos. "Not only is this screensaver similar in its approach to a potentially illegal distributed denial of service attack, but it also is in danger of turning innocent computer users into vigilantes, who may not be prepared for whatever retaliation the spammers care to dream up."

Furniture and lighting recorded the largest monthly volume decrease, falling by 6.7 per cent. Furniture and lighting recorded the largest monthly volume decrease, falling by 6.7 per cent. Christopher McKinley Retail sales volumes for September increased by one per cent when compared to the same month last year, according to new figures released today by the Central Statistics Office (CSO). The value and volume of retail sales were also up 0.5 per cent in September of this year when compared to August. However, the value of these sales has dropped by the same amount (0.5 per cent) on an annual basis. Sectors which recorded the largest month on month volume increases include fuel, which was up 3.2 per cent, as well as food, beverages and tobacco, which rose by 2.3 per cent. Sales of hardware items, paints and glass also increased by 2.2 per cent. The CSO noted that when motor trade activity is excluded there is no monthly change to the volume of retail sales, with the annual figure showing a 0.3 per cent drop. Similarly, the value of retail sales drop by 0.5 per cent (monthly) and 1.8 per cent (annually) when motor trades are excluded. The value of retail motor trade activities, of which new car sales accounts for approximately 45 per cent of turnover, has increased by 9.4 per cent in the year to September 2013. Furniture and lighting together with books, newspapers and stationery were the sectors with the largest monthly volume decrease, with both categories falling by 6.7 per cent and 2.8 per cent respectively. The volume of sales in non-specialised stores, which consist primarily of large scale grocers such as SuperValue and Dunnes, also dropped by 1.9 per cent. Alan McQuaid, economist with Merrion Stockbrokers, said that households are still very nervous about the economic climate and are more willing to save than spend until there is greater clarity about the outlook going forward. However, he noted that an improvement in unemployment could translate into stronger figures. âA continuation of this trend in the coming months will eventually be reflected in stronger retail sales in our view,â he said.

Gadget show heralds MP3 season Gadget show heralds MP3 season Partners of those who love their hi-tech gear may want to get their presents in early as experts predict a gadget shortage this Christmas. With Apple's iPod topping wish lists again, there may not be enough iPod minis to go round, predicts Oliver Irish, editor of gadget magazine Stuff. "The iPod mini is likely to be this year's Tracey Island," said Mr Irish. Stuff has compiled a list of the top 10 gadgets for 2004 and the iPod is at number one. For anyone bewildered by the choice of gadgets on the market, Stuff and What Hi-Fi? are hosting a best-of gadget show in London this weekend. Star of the show will be Sony's Qrio Robot, an all-singing, all-dancing, football-playing man-machine who can even hold intelligent conversations. But he is not for sale and Sony has no commercial plans for the robot. "He will greet visitors and is flying in from Japan. He probably has his own airplane seat, that is how highly Sony prize him," said Mr Irish. Also on display will be a virtual keyboard which projects itself onto any flat surface. The event will play host to a large collection of digital music players, from companies such as Creative, Sony and Philips as well as the ubiquitously fashionable iPod from Apple. Suggestions that it could be a gaming or wireless Christmas are unlikely to come true as MP3 players remain the most popular stocking filler, said Mr Irish. "Demand is huge and Apple has promised that it can supply enough but people might struggle to get their hands on iPod minis," said Mr Irish. For those who like their gadgets to be multi-talented, the Gizmondo, a powerful gaming console with GPS and GPRS, that also doubles up as an MP3 player, movie player and camera, could be a must-have. "What is impressive is how much it can do and how well it can do them," said Mr Irish. This Christmas, gadgets will not be an all-male preserve. "Women will be getting gadgets from husbands and boyfriends as well as buying them for themselves," said Mr Irish. "Gadgets nowadays are lifestyle products rather than just for geeks."

Game makers get Xbox 2 sneak peek Game makers get Xbox 2 sneak peek Microsoft has given game makers a glimpse of the new Xbox 2 console. Some details of the Xbox's performance and what gaming will be like with the device were given at the annual Game Developers Conference in the US. Xbox frontman J. Allard said the console looked set to be capable of one trillion calculations per second. Also all titles for the new Xbox will have the same interface to make it easy to play online and buy extras for characters or other add-ons for games. Microsoft is saving the official unveiling of the Xbox 2, codenamed Xenon, for the E3 show in May and the device could be on shop shelves by November. However, during his keynote speech at GDC Mr Allard, who heads development of game-making tools for the console, gave a glimpse into how some of its core software will work. He said gaming was entering a "high-definition" era that demanded detailed and convincing graphics that could adequately compete with the HDTV people were starting to watch as well as the HD DVDs that will soon start to appear. Industry watchers took this to mean that the Xbox 2 will push for HDTV quality graphics as standard as well as multi-channel audio to give gamers an authentic experience. Mr Allard said Microsoft had to work hard to ensure that it was easy for game makers to produce titles for the Xbox 2 and for players to get playing. To this end Microsoft was building in to Xbox hardware systems to support headset chat, buddy list controls and custom soundtracks so developers were free to concentrate on the games. The Xbox would also support well-known industry specifications, such as DirectX, to make it simple for game studios to make titles for the console. For gamers this emphasis on ease of use would mean every Xbox title uses the same interface to set up online play and get at music stored on the hardware. This interface will hold details of a player's statistics and skill level on a "gamer card" as well as give access to a store where people can spend small amounts of cash to buy extras for their avatars or add-ons, such as new maps or vehicles, for games they possess. This ability to personalise games and in-game characters would be key in the future, said Mr Allard. Only with such consistency would the Xbox be able to support the 10-20 million subscribers that it was aiming for, said Mr Allard. During his speech Mr Allard took several swipes at the Playstation and said processors for consoles had to be made with developers, not just engineers, in mind. "Our approach is Bruce Lee, not brute force," he said. Return to results
Games maker fights for survival Games maker fights for survival One of Britain's largest independent game makers, Argonaut Games, has been put up for sale. The London-based company behind the Harry Potter games has sacked about 100 employees due to a severe cash crisis. The administrators told Online News News Online that selling Argonaut was the only way to save it as it had run out of cash. Argonaut warned that it was low on cash 10 days ago when its shares were suspended from trading on the London Stock Exchange. Argonaut has been making games for some 18 years and is one the largest independent games developers in the UK. Along with its headquarters in north London, it operates studios in Cambridge and Sheffield. Argonaut was behind the Harry Potter games which provided a healthy flow of cash into the company. But, like all software developers, Argonaut needed a constant flow of deals with publishers. Signs that it was in trouble emerged in August, when it warned it was heading for losses of Â£6m in the financial year due to delays in signing new contracts for games. Those new deals were further delayed, leading Argonaut to warn in mid-October that it was running out of cash and suspend trading of its shares on the London Stock Exchange. As part of cost-cutting measures, some 100 employees were fired. "When the news about the Â£6m loss came out, we knew there were going to be redundancies," said Jason Parkinson, one of the game developers sacked by Argonaut. "A lot of people suspected that Argonaut had been in trouble for some time," he told Online News News Online. Mr Parkinson said staff were told the job losses were necessary to save Argonaut from going under. At the start of the year, the company employed 268 people. After the latest round of cuts there are 80 staff at Argonaut headquarters in Edgware in north London, with 17 at its Morpheme offices in Kentish Town, London, and 22 at the Just Add Monsters base in Cambridge. Argonaut called in administrators David Rubin & Partners on Friday to find a way to rescue the company from collapse. It spent the weekend going over the company's finances and concluded that the only way to save the business was to put it up for sale. The administrator told Online News News Online that the costs of restructuing would be too high, partly because of the overheads from the company's four premises across the UK. It said it was hopeful that it could save some 110 jobs by selling the business, saying it had had expressions of interest from several quarters and were looking for a quick sale. The administrator said it would ensure that staff made redundant would receive any wages, redundancy or holiday pay due to them, hopefully by Christmas. Comments are closed for this article.
Gerrard future not decided by Cardiff loss Gerrard future not decided by Cardiff loss Steven Gerrard's own goal in Liverpool's Carling Cup defeat against Chelsea sparked yet another round of speculation about his Anfield future. There was no denying the irony of Gerrard's mishap, coming as it did in a cup final against the club that almost paid Â£30m for him last summer. And that irony was not missed by the media - or indeed Chelsea's supporters. But to suggest the incident, and the defeat, will shape whether he stays or goes from Liverpool, is wrong. It was just one of those things that could have happened anywhere at any time, in any place and in any game. It wasn't even a mistake, although you could say the mistake was in three Liverpool defenders going for the same ball. But to pull together a sub-plot or conspiracy theory that the own goal, combined with Liverpool's defeat, has finally put Gerrard on the road to Stamford Bridge is nonsense. It was inevitable that because it came against Chelsea, there would be speculation, but I believe Gerrard will be concentrating on one thing and one thing alone. And that is ensuring Liverpool qualify for the Champions League by getting that fourth place in the Premiership. I don't think any decision has been made, and will certainly not be influenced by anything that happened in Cardiff on Sunday. Liverpool must hope they clinch fourth place and that is enough to persuade their massively influential captain to stay. From Liverpool's point of view, the defeat was a bitter disappointment, but when the disappointment has subsided, they can take heart from a week of encouragement both at home and abroad. Liverpool had an excellent win against Bayer Leverkusen in the Champions League, when they got it down, played and scored goals. And in Sunday's Carling Cup final, they showed real defensive resilience when they were pinned back for long periods. I think Rafael Benitez is on the right lines and speaks with a lot of confidence about his team and what he wants from them. But there is no doubt Liverpool's next two games will shape their season, at Newcastle away in the league and then Bayer away in the Champions League second leg. What they cannot afford to do is produce any performances like they produced at Burnley, Southampton or Birmingham. If they slip up at Newcastle then Everton beat Blackburn 24 hours later, that will be an 11-point gap and that's an awful long way back for them in the race for the Champions League place. There is added spice because Everton are fourth. They had an impressive win at Aston Villa, and you cannot take away from them what they have done. They've had an uncertain spell recently, but they've picked up points here and there and that is a great tribute to manager David Moyes and his players. And in Tim Cahill, they've paid Â£2m for a player from outside the Premiership who has proved himself in the top-flight. Liverpool will still be a massive magnet for top players, but they may also need to seek out the type of signings that Moyes has pulled off with Cahill. He has been excellent since arriving from Millwall and has been a very sound purchase by Moyes. While the battle for fourth hots up, Manchester United turned the screw a little tighter on leaders Chelsea by beating Portsmouth and reducing the gap to six points - albeit with a game in hand for Jose Mourinho's side. The Carling Cup win against Liverpool was massive for Chelsea, because it stopped all the inevitable questions that would have been posed if they had lost three games in a week. I don't think they answered all the questions, because for all their long periods of possession they were struggling to score until Gerrard's unfortunate intervention. Obviously a lot of focus has been centred on Mourinho for events on and off the pitch, but I think he will be more than happy with that because it means the heat is taken off his players. If people are asking questions about the manager, they are leaving the players in peace, so Mourinho will settle for that. And while United are showing once again there is no-one better when it comes to the chase, I don't think there is any shift in the balance of power in the Premiership. It is all Chelsea's to lose, with a six-point lead and a game in hand. Throw in that their next four league games are against the bottom four sides in the table, and you can see they are in a strong position. They must keep their eye on the ball because Manchester United are masters of this situation - but the balance of power still lies with Chelsea. Comments are closed for this article.
Government to negotiate on all fronts for debt relief, says Minister Government to negotiate on all fronts for debt relief, says Minister Minister for Finance Michael Noonan: âWe [are] still in a position to negotiate support from Europe so our debt can move down towards the European average.â Photograph: Eric Luke Suzanne Lynch, Derek Scally Ireland will continue to campaign for retrospective direct recapitalisation of its banks by the ESM fund despite continuing German opposition to the move, Minister for Finance Michael Noonan said yesterday. In a subtle but significant change of reasoning, Mr Noonan told RTÃ radio that the Government would be negotiating on all fronts for debt relief. âWe [are] still in a position to negotiate support from Europe so our debt can move down towards the European average,â the Minister said. With a growing sense in euro zone circles that Irelandâs strong performance under the bailout and imminent exit from the programme has lessened its case for further debt relief, Ireland may try to argue that its still-fragile fiscal position justifies further moves to alleviate the debt it incurred through the bank bailouts. ECB executive board member JÃ¶rg Asmussen said on Monday that Ireland still faced risks, including from its banking sector and on the fiscal side. âThe deficit compared to the European average is still very high,â he said. Special case The Government has consistently argued that Bank of Ireland and AIB should be eligible for direct bank recapitalisation by the ESM fund, having secured assurances in June 2012 that Ireland would be treated by European authorities as a special case. This June, euro zone finance ministers agreed to examine the issue of âretroactiveâ deployment of the ESMâs direct recapitalisation instrument on a case-by-case basis. However, German finance minister Wolfgang SchÃ¤uble said on Tuesday that retrospective bank recapitalisation for Ireland was ânot probableâ for the time being, noting that such a move would require a change in German legislation. Mr Noonan said he was not concerned by Mr SchÃ¤uble âs comments. âI actually felt he left the door open,â he said. While the door had allegedly been closed on a promissory note deal and an extension of Irelandâs bailout loans, both had been achieved, he said. Coalition discussions He also stressed that the German finance ministerâs comments should be viewed in the context of ongoing coalition discussions in Germany, which has seen the Social Democrats Party take a tough line against Irelandâs claims for further debt relief. While Dublin is preparing for negotiations with its international lenders in the coming weeks on a strategy to exit the bailout, any decision on ESM direct recapitalisation is still a year away. Direct recapitalisation will only be possible once the Single Supervisory Mechanism is established. With European finance ministers having given the final go-ahead to the SSM on Tuesday, the mechanism will come into force in about a yearâs time. Germany hardened its stance against a common resolution fund for the euro zone at a finance ministers meeting in Luxembourg this week, reiterating its preference for a network of national supervisors, and raising questions about the rate of progress on banking union.

HSE to investigate if charity money was used to top up salary at Central Remedial Clinic HSE to investigate if charity money was used to top up salary at Central Remedial Clinic Charity linked to clinic has â¬14 million at a time of cuts to services, committee hears Independent TD Shane Ross said it appeared the CRC had access to large sums of money when it was cutting services. Photograph: Bryan OâBrien The Health Service Executive has been asked to investigate whether funding from a charitable organisation linked to the Central Remedial Clinic (CRC) was used to fund unauthorised payments to senior staff. At the DÃ¡il Public Accounts Committee yesterday, it emerged that a company called the Friends and Supporters of the Central Remedial Clinic had â¬14 million in funds at the end of 2011. This company, listed as a charity, also received National Lottery funding of almost â¬4 million between 2010 and 2011. Allowance of â¬19,016 This comprised a HSE-funded salary of â¬106,900, a CRC-funded salary of â¬116,949 and a separate CRC-funded allowance of â¬19,016. In addition, 25 per cent of the CRC salary was paid into a private pension fund. Unauthorised private allowances are a breach of public sector pay policy. In response, HSE director general Tony OâBrien said the figures seemed âstrangeâ and agreed questions needed to be asked. He also pointed out that while in one year it received Lottery funding of â¬2 million, at the end of that year the charity had a supply of nearly the same amount. âClearly, there are questions to be asked and answered over that,â he said. The HSE chief pledged to investigate the issue on behalf of the committee, but added the HSEâs legal relationship was with the CRC and not with the parents and friends organisation. He added, however, he was âcautious to form an opinionâ until there was greater clarity over whether these funds were available to the CRC and what the aims and objectives of the charitable body were. The clinic â which is a national centre for the care, treatment and development of children and adults with physical disabilities â was unavailable for comment last night. It did issue a statement to The Online News last week in relation to queries over pay for senior staff. It said figures contained in a HSE internal audit were âhistoricâ and did not provide a current picture of staff remuneration at the Central Remedial Clinic. âPrivate matterâ âThe personal salary levels of individual staff within the Central Remedial Clinic is a matter reserved, under the Central Remedial Clinicâs corporate governance, for the board of the CRC and as such is a private matter between the clinic and its staff,â it said. At the committee meeting yesterday, Labour TD Robert Dowds , a former employee of a school under the auspices of the CRC, said he was dismayed to learn that funds appeared to have been used to top-up senior salaries at a time of cut-backs to the organisation.

HSE urges people to get vaccinated against flu HSE urges people to get vaccinated against flu Up to 1,000 people could die in a particularly severe flu season, according to immunisation office The Health Service Executive is urging people in at-risk groups to get vaccinated against the flu. Photograph: PA The Health Service Executive is urging people in at-risk groups to get vaccinated against the flu. Those in the at-risk groups are everyone aged 65 and over; anyone over six months of age with a long term illness requiring regular medical follow-up such as chronic lung disease, chronic heart disease, diabetes or those with lower immunity due to disease or treatment; pregnant women; and residents of nursing homes and other long stay facilities This yearâs seasonal flu vaccine protects against the three common flu virus strains expected to be circulating this year based on advice from the World Health Organization . It is important for all those in the at risk groups to be vaccinated again this year as the virus strains in the vaccine have changed since last year. The flu jab is available from GPs or pharmacists. Anyone under 18 should attend their GP. The vaccine and consultation are free for those with a Medical Card or GP Visit Card. Research by the HSE Health Protection Surveillance Centre, as part of a wider European study estimates that over the last eight flu seasons between 200 and 500 people in Ireland died each year from flu related illness, and up to 1000 people could die in a particularly severe flu season, according to the head of the HSEâs National Immunisation Office, Dr Brenda Corcoran . âThis study starkly highlights that flu can be a very serious and sometimes deadly illness, especially for people who are older or who have a long-term illness. The flu vaccine is the best defence against flu, yet every year many people in the at risk groups fail to get vaccinated and so put themselves at risk of serious illness or even death,â she said.

Health authority asked to investigate pay arrangements at Central Remedial Clinic Health authority asked to investigate pay arrangements at Central Remedial Clinic The HSE has confirmed for the first time that some of the Republicâs leading hospitals â including Tallaght, the Rotunda (pictured), the National Maternity Hospital and the Coombe Womenâs Hospital â have been paying senior staff more than is permitted by the Government The HSE has confirmed for the first time that some of the Republicâs leading hospitals â including Tallaght, the Rotunda, the National Maternity Hospital and the Coombe Womenâs Hospital â have been paying senior staff more than is permitted by the Government. In a new development, the health authority has been asked to investigate whether funding from a charitable organisation linked to the Central Remedial Clinic was used to fund any unauthorised payments to senior staff. At the DÃ¡il Public Accounts Committee yesterday, it emerged that a company called the Friends and Supporters of the Central Remedial Clinic had â¬14 million at the end of 2011. Lottery funding This company, which is listed as a charity, received National Lottery funding of â¬2 million in 2011. Deputy Shane Ross said it appeared the Central Remedial Clinic had access to large sums of money at a time when it and other organisations were cutting services. The HSE gave the committee a full list of agencies deemed to not be in compliance with public pay policy last night. They include St Michaelâs House, Our Ladyâs Hospice in Dublin , Cappagh National Orthopaedic Hospital , the Royal Hospital in Donnybrook, Dublin, the Dublin Dental School and Hospital, Carriglea Cairde Services in Dungarvan , Co Waterford , and the Muiriosa Foundation . The committee yesterday began hearings into revelations around the widespread breach of public sector pay policy in voluntary hospitals and other State-funded agencies. The HSE said only seven of the 43 State-funded voluntary hospitals and health agencies were confirmed as being compliant with Government pay policy. It added that about 30 organisations were claiming to be compliant but that these assertions were now being verified as self-declarations and may not be valid.Last week the National Maternity Hospital said it remunerated its personnel âin accordance with their employment terms, with the agreement of the appropriate board sub-committees, and in full compliance with public service pay requirementsâ. Not compliant However, the HSE told the committee the hospital had confirmed to it by letter that it was not compliant. Internal Department of Health files obtained by The Online News revealed that four senior figures at the National Maternity Hospital, the master, the secretary manager, the director of nursing and the financial controller were receiving âprivately funded allowancesâ ranging from â¬30,000 to â¬45,000 on top of salary. Hospital master Dr Rhona Mahony said last week that â¬45,000 paid to her was not a âtop-upâ payment but related to professional fees from private patients . However, last night the HSE said the payments were identified as privately funded allowances because âthat was the exact description provided by the hospitalâ. Meanwhile, Our Ladyâs Hospital in Crumlin has confirmed that its chief executive was receiving an allowance funded from on-site commercial activities. It has also confirmed that neither the 2009 pension levy nor the pay cut under the Haddington Road agreement had been deducted from a â¬30,000 allowance paid to its chief executive from profits from shops. .

Hearts of Oak 3-2 Cotonsport Hearts of Oak 3-2 Cotonsport Hearts of Oak set up an all Ghanaian Confederation Cup final with a 3-2 win over Cameroon's Cotonsport Garoua in Accra on Sunday. The win for Hearts means they will play Asante Kotoko in the two-leg final, after the Kumasi team qualified from Group A on Saturday. In the other Group B game Cameroon's beat of South Africa 3-2 in Douala, neither side could have qualified for the final. Hearts of Oak started the game needing a win to qualify for the final while Cotonsport only needed to avoid defeat to go through. Louis Agyemang scored the first two goals for Hearts either side of half time before Ben Don Bortey scored the third. Hearts looked set for a comfortable win but Cotonsport staged a late fight back scoring twice late on. First of all Boukar Makaji scored in the 89th minute and then 3 minutes into injury time at the end of the game Andre Nzame III was on target. But it was too little too late for the Cameroonians and Hearts held on to win the game and a place in the final. The first leg of the final will be played in Accra on the weekend of 27-28 November and the second leg two weeks later on the 11 December in Kumasi. In the other Group B game Cameroon's Sable Batie took the lead in the 35th minute through Kemadjou before Santos equalised on the hour mark thanks to Thokozani Xaba . Bernard Ngom put Sable ahead just five minutes later and then Ernest Nfor settled the game on 68 minutes. Ruben Cloete scored the South African sides consolation with just three minutes left on the clock. Comments are closed for this article.
Holles Street called Mahony fee âprivate allowanceâ - HSE Holles Street called Mahony fee âprivate allowanceâ - HSE Master of National Maternity Hospital says â¬45,000 was fees from private patients Master of the Holles Street hospital Dr Rhona Mahony last week issued a statement rejecting reports that she was in receipt of a private allowance. Photograph: Eric Luke/The Online News The Health Service Executive says the description of a â¬45,000 payment to the master of the National Maternity Hospital as a âprivate allowanceâ in an internal audit report was based on information provided to it by the hospital. Last week, the master of the Holles Street hospital, Dr Rhona Mahony , issued a statement rejecting reports that she was in receipt of a private allowance. She said the â¬45,000 payment was in respect of âprofessional feesâ from private patientsâ attending the hospital, in addition to her â¬280,000 salary. In response to a query yesterday, a HSE spokeswoman said the information supplied to the executive and used in the internal audit report had been supplied by the hospital itself. Any queries on how the payment was categorised should be directed to the hospital, she added. Last night, a spokesman for the National Maternity Hospital said it had nothing to add other than a statement issued by its board last week. This statement said the hospital âremunerates its personnel in accordance with their employment terms, with the agreement of the appropriate board sub-committees, and in full compliance with public service pay requirements.â Legal advice The Online News understands that the hospital board has sought legal advice over the â¬45,000 payment. This will be shared with board members at its next meeting, due to be held shortly. A member of the hospitalâs board has been formally asked to resign after being accused of making âill-informed public commentaryâ regarding top-up payments to senior health sector executives. Cllr Pat Crimmins (FG), a member of the hospital board, last week questioned payments to Dr Mahony and other senior health executives and said unauthorised payments should be handed back to the exchequer. âInappropriateâ Late last week, he received a letter from the deputy chair of the hospital board, Niall Doyle , requesting him to resign on the basis of what was described as his âextraordinary behaviourâ.It also stated that his public commentary was âinappropriateâ. On foot of this, he was formally requested to consider his position as a member of the board. However, another hospital board member, Cllr Gerry Ashe (Labour) last night called on the board to withdraw what she described as a âvindictiveâ letter. âI have huge sympathy for him,â she said, âI donât support the call for his resignation from the board and I think it should be withdrawn. Iâm defending the principle that the board canât decide who sits on it.â Cllr Ashe said that, despite being a member of the board, she was not aware that a letter was being sent to him. On the issue of Dr Mahonyâs pay, she said the master had told board members last week that what was being described as a top-up fee was income from her private patients. âShe explained that all the money had come from private patients, and I accept that. Iâve no reason not to.â Cllr Crimmins said he was taking legal advice over the letter before deciding whether to resign. He has defended his decision to question the source of private money being given to senior health executives. âIâm a councillor and a public representative. I feel Iâm being gagged for saying what I believed to be appropriate. I didnât accuse the board of Holles Street of anything,â he said. Comments are closed for this article.
Humanoid robot learns how to run Humanoid robot learns how to run Car-maker Honda's humanoid robot Asimo has just got faster and smarter. The Japanese firm is a leader in developing two-legged robots and the new, improved Asimo (Advanced Step in Innovative Mobility) can now run, find his way around obstacles as well as interact with people. Eventually Asimo could find gainful employment in homes and offices. "The aim is to develop a robot that can help people in their daily lives," said a Honda spokesman. To get the robot running for the first time was not an easy process as it involved Asimo making an accurate leap and absorbing the impact of landing without slipping or spinning. The "run" he is now capable of is perhaps not quite up to Olympic star Kelly Holmes' standard. At 3km/h, it is closer to a leisurely jog. Its makers claim that it is almost four times as fast as Sony's Qrio, which became the first robot to run last year. The criteria for running robots is defined by engineers as having both feet off the ground between strides. Asimo has improved in other ways too, increasing his walking speed, from 1.6km/h to 2.5km, growing 10cm to 130cm and putting on 2kg in weight. While he may not quite be ready for yoga, he does have more freedom of movement, being able to twist his hips and bend his wrists, thumbs and neck. Asimo has already made his mark on the international robot scene and in November was inducted into the Robot Hall of Fame. He has wowed audiences around the world with his ability to walk upstairs, recognise faces and come when beckoned. In August 2003 he even attended a state dinner in the Czech Republic, travelling with the Japanese prime minister as a goodwill envoy. He is one of a handful of robots used by tech firms to trumpet their technological advances. Technology developed for Asimo could be used in the automobile industry as electronics increasingly take over from mechanics in car design. For the moment Asimo's biggest role is an entertainer and the audience gathered to see his first public run greeted his slightly comical gait with amusement, according to reports. Robots can fulfil serious functions in society and the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe predicts that the worldwide market for industrial robots will swell from 81,000 units in 2003 to 106,000 in 2007.

Hunger the âleast importantâ factor in determining what we eat Hunger the âleast importantâ factor in determining what we eat Fast-food and soft drinks account for âa minorityâ of calories we consume but we focus on those items while ignoring foods such as potatoes, chicken and meat which account for most of our calorie intake, Prof Mike Gibney , head of UCDâs centre for food and health, said yesterday. Asked if a fat and sugar tax would curb obesity rates, he said everything should be on the table. âThe question is: how do you define if it works?â He seriously doubted a claim that a tax of 10 per cent on sugary drinks would reduce the number of obese adults by 10,000. If someone cut back on sugary drinks their bodies would seek those calories elsewhere. Intake âItâs very easy to talk about how a tax would reduce your intake. Iâm not too sure how that would impact long-term on obesity. If I thought it would, I would be the first to vote for it.â He said this âtsunami of lardâ tended to come in waves throughout centuries and by blaming one thing we were ignoring the complexity of the problem. Hippocrates [who was born in 460 BC] wrote in his essay on the Scythians that the girls were âamazingly flabby and podgyâ while obesity was common in ancient Rome. âFood choice is the most complicated thing you are ever going to see,â he said. What we ate was determined by anthropology, biology, sociology and psychology, while hunger was the least important issue. He was speaking at an open meeting in Dublin organised by the Food Safety Authority of Irelandâs food safety consultative council with the theme: âWho is responsible for what we eat?â The authorityâs chief executive, Prof Alan OâReilly, said measures such as taxes on certain categories of food could lead to claims of a nanny state and they ignored all the other causes of obesity. If you taxed fat and sugar because they caused obesity, then shouldnât you tax sofas and televisions? âPeople over-eat and they eat the wrong foods and so on...but people also donât take enough exercise, so why not tax all of the other aspects like lifts, escalators...why focus just on food with respect to fiscal measures?â Healthier options He said the food industry had a window of opportunity to voluntarily introduce healthier options with reduced fat and sugar. If they failed to do so more stringent regulations and tighter controls would be brought in. He called for a carrot and stick approach, similar to that used in reducing road deaths. Prof Reilly also pointed to a recent initiative by the Dubai municipality which gave people one gram of gold for each kilo of weight they lost over a month. âPeople were queuing to lose weight. Maybe Minister Noonan should have introduced that in the budget,â he added, not entirely seriously. Comments are closed for this article.
IBM frees 500 software patents IBM frees 500 software patents Computer giant IBM says 500 of its software patents will be released into the open development community. The move means developers will be able to use the technologies without paying for a licence from the company. IBM described the step as a "new era" in how it dealt with intellectual property and promised further patents would be made freely available. The patents include software for a range of practices, including text recognition and database management. Traditional technology business policy is to amass patents and despite IBM's announcement the company continues to follow this route. IBM was granted 3,248 patents in 2004, more than any other firm in the US, the New York Times reports. For each of the past 12 years IBM has been granted more US patents than any other company. IBM has received 25,772 US patents in that period and reportedly has more than 40,000 current patents. In a statement, Dr John E. Kelly, IBM senior vice president, Technology and Intellectual Property, said: "True innovation leadership is about more than just the numbers of patents granted. It's about innovating to benefit customers, partners and society. "Our pledge today is the beginning of a new era in how IBM will manage intellectual property." In the past, IBM has supported the non-commercial operating system Linux although critics have said this was done only as an attempt to undermine Microsoft. The company said it wanted to encourage other firms to release patents into what it called a "patent commons". Adam Jollans, IBM's world-wide Linux strategy manager, said the move was a genuine attempt to encourage innovation. "We believe that releasing these patents will result in innovation moving more quickly. "This is about encouraging collaboration and following a model much like academia." Mr Jollans likened the plan for a patent commons to the way the internet was developed and said everyone could take advantage of the result of collaboration. "The internet's impact has been on everyone. The benefits are there for everyone to take advantage of." Stuart Cohen, chief executive of US firm Open Source Development Labs, said the move could mean a change in the way companies deal with patents. "I think other companies will follow suit," he said. But not everyone was as supportive. Florian Mueller, campaign manager of a group lobbying toprevent software patents becoming legal in the European Union,dismissed IBM's move as insubstantial. "It's just diversionary tactics," wrote Mr Mueller, who leadsnosoftwarepatents.com, in a message on the group's website. "Let's put this into perspective: We're talking aboutroughly one percent of IBM's worldwide patent portfolio. They filethat number of patents in about a month's time," he added. IBM will continue to hold the 500 patents but it has pledged to seek no royalties from the patents. The company said it would not place any restrictions on companies, groups or individuals who use them in open-source projects. Open source software is developed by programmers who offer the source code - the origins of the program - for free and allow others to adapt or improve the software. End users have the right to modify and redistribute the software, as well as the right to package and sell the software. Other areas covered by the patents released by IBM include storage management, simultaneous multiprocessing, image processing, networking and e-commerce. Comments are closed for this article.
IMO to recommend deal to resolve doctors' dispute IMO to recommend deal to resolve doctors' dispute Plan drawn up during LRC talks on row over non-consultant hospital doctors Junior doctors on picket duty outside the Mater hospital in Dublin last week. Photograph: Cyril Byrne/The Online News The Irish Medical Organisation (IMO) is to recommend that non-consultant hospital doctors accept new proposals aimed at resolving a dispute over long working hours. The IMOâs non-consultant doctor committee tonight accepted a new plan drawn up following talks at the Labour Relations Commission . The proposal will now be sent out to a ballot of non-consultant hospital doctors with a recommendation that it be accepted. This month non-consultant hospital doctors staged a one-day strike as part of a campaign to end shifts of more than 24 hours and for the health service to comply with EU working-time rules. The HSE has said it will eliminate 24-hour shifts from January, and implement the EU working-time directive for non-consultant hospital doctors by the end of next year. One key sticking point was the sanctions to apply to hospitals that breached the new rules. Under the plan hospitals would have some funding withheld from the start of the year and would receive this money back on compliance with the working-time limits. Return to results
If growth arrives, Budget 2014 may be last of austerity series If growth arrives, Budget 2014 may be last of austerity series For bailout exit plan to work, signs of acceleration need to be maintained Itâs been said many times but the simple truth about economic growth merits repeating: it cures all ills. A figure of 2 - 3 per cent growth, if it arrives, means that this is the last of the austerity budgets. If the economy falls short, we will be back next year for more of the same. Thatâs the economics. Politically, if we are not growing again it will almost certainly be true that much of the rest of Europe will also be stuck in the doldrums. And that will bring the risk a resumption of the euro zone crisis: itâs not just Ireland that needs growth to make a reappearance. Minister for Finance Michael Noonan spoke about this being the third year of economic growth. Technically, depending on the growth measure we look at, thatâs just about true. A better description would say that the economy has been bouncing along the bottom. But for all of the plans to work, for a sustainable exit from the bailout, recent signs of an acceleration in growth needs to be maintained, or, better still, increase further. Thatâs what is embodied in the Governmentâs forecasts. Taking â¬2.5 billion out of the economy doesnât help the growth outlook of course, but it is a measure of the confidence of independent economic forecasters such as the ESRI that they expect the economy to deliver next year, notwithstanding fiscal contraction. Do the measures announced today (in many cases pre-announced) add up to a coherent whole? In many ways, the political imperatives behind budget set-pieces nearly always guarantee the outcome resembles a dogâs breakfast. The budget process is not conducive to joined up thinking. Todayâs glaring example is the announcement of free medical care for children under five. Universal benefits paid irrespective of means or needs rarely, if ever, make any sense. It would seem that about the only possible rationalisation for this measure is Labourâs standing in the opinion polls. The balance between spending cuts and tax rises is more or less as expected. The demands of the troika, driven by the logic of economics, always pushes government spending cuts rather than tax rises. Politics points in the opposite direction. Politics demands discussion of âfairnessâ and âequityâ but we rarely pin down what we mean by these terms. In some fascinating tax tables published with the main budget documents, we are given illustrations of the very progressive nature of our tax system. Pundits often complain that high earning, often self-employed, people pay too little tax. For example, Sean Healy of Social Justice Ireland recently proposed that high earners be taxed, all in, at 45 per cent of their total income - thatâs an average rate of tax, not marginal. I imagine he meant this as part of a tax hike policy for high earners. As it turns out, according to the Government, a single self-employed person on â¬120,000 will be handing over 44.8 per cent of his or her income to the State both this year and next. And close to 40 per cent of workers wonât be paying anything at all. Ireland does have a problem with entrepreneurship: we donât form enough new businesses. As the Minister said, we have culture that encourages us to become employees not employers. Job creation in any economy typically comes from small and medium sized companies, not from the corporate behemoths. The measures he announced today are welcome but the necessary cultural change will take time and much more effort. But this is where the new jobs have to come from. As economists like to say, growth is a necessary but by no means sufficient condition. The Government is forecasting a smooth transition back to economic sovereignty. Growth will come from the export sector, with employment growth leading to a better outlook for the consumer. The Government itself will not be making a contribution to growth for quite some time to come. It has done what it can: what happens next is largely out of our hands. Itâs a funny kind of sovereignty that we are about to regain. .

Increased tax take adds weight to recovery claims Increased tax take adds weight to recovery claims Exchequer figures for November show total revenues rose 8% year on year to â¬51.5 billion Minister for Finance Michael Noonan said Novemberâs Exchequer figures were âhard evidenceâ that economic recovery was taking hold. Photograph: Cyril Byrne/The Online News. Income tax and VAT receipts grew last month, prompting further claims that the Republicâs economy has returned to growth. Todayâs Exchequer figures show that the Revenue collected â¬2.35 billion in income tax in November, almost 8 per cent more than the â¬2.2 billion returned during the same month last year. VAT returns increased at an even stronger rate, indicating that consumer spending is up. The sales tax delivered â¬1.63 billion to Government coffers in November, 9.5 per cent more than the same month last year, when the figure was â¬1.48 billion. Minister for Finance, Michael Noonan , said âthe strong performance set out in todayâs figures is hard evidence that the recovery seen in the high frequency data is taking hold across the economyâ. Overall, the total amount of income tax paid in the 11 months to the end of November was â¬35.2 billion, 4.2 per cent ahead of the â¬33.8 billion collected during the same period in 2012. The total was also ahead of the budget target, which was â¬34.97 billion. Total revenues, tax and non-tax, for the 11-month period, came to â¬51.5 billion, 8.3 per cent more than the â¬47.6 billion collected during the same period last year 5 per cent ahead of the Governmentâs â¬49 billion budget target. The Government spent â¬60.08 billion during the first 11 months of the year, 0.8 per cent less than during the same period in 2012. The figure was 4.4 per cent less than its budget target of â¬62.85 billion. Conal Mac Coille , economist with stockbroking firm, Davy, said that the Government is on track to âcomfortably beatâ its deficit target for the year of 7.5 per cent of gross domestic product.

Investment drive accompanied by series of private sector announcements Investment drive accompanied by series of private sector announcements Britainâs Prime Minister David Cameron at Stormont Castle yesterday Northern Ireland is a safe and profitable place in which to invest, British prime minister David Cameron has told an international conference in Belfast . Addressing more than 150 overseas investors, government and diplomatic officials, he urged the private sector to âput your money in Northern Ireland and be part of this incredible success storyâ. âTurning a cornerâ In a speech at Belfastâs Titanic centre in the docklands, Mr Cameron stressed the Northern Ireland economy, like that in the UK as a whole âis turning a cornerâ and said that ânew investments are pouring inâ. The regionâs film and TV production sector was singled out as the prime minister ran through a list of Northern Irelandâs best known products ranging from Londonâs red buses, made in Ballymena , Co Antrim, to Bushmills whiskey. He announced that the Heritage Lottery Fund was poised to invest heavily in the Titanic drawing rooms in a building adjacent to the visitorsâ centre where the famous liner was designed. Praising aerospace manufacturers Bombardier , he said the Belfast plantâs overall Â£520 million (â¬620 million) investment would directly help more than 200 industrial suppliers throughout the North and Britain. The company underscored the prime ministerâs investment initiative by announcing a Â£125 million (â¬147 million) research and development drive involving the creation of 250 further jobs in Belfast over the coming year. Mr Cameron claimed Northern Ireland, with more than 800 international investors, was second only to London for inward investment with almost 8,000 jobs from foreign investment in the last three years alone. Tax powers He vowed to make a final decision next autumn on whether corporation tax powers should be devolved to Stormont. This would allow the Executive to cut Northern Irelandâs rate to make it competitive with rates in the Republic. Mr Cameron referred only briefly to ongoing political problems and threatened instability at Executive level, insisting instead that the Stormont institutions and the wider peace were secure. âFrom time to time the news agenda works against us but in every country, if they were judged by what goes on the news, I am afraid we would have a very skewed understanding of each otherâs existence,â he said. âNorthern Ireland has come a very long way over the past 15 years â politically, socially and economically. We have many of the building blocks in place to take our economy to a higher level and inward investment will play a very crucial role.â Comments are closed for this article.
JP Morgan in record $13 billion settlement with US authorities JP Morgan in record $13 billion settlement with US authorities US bank admits to routinely overstating quality of mortgages it was selling to investors The headquarters of JP Morgan Chase is seen in New York. The bank admitted it regularly overstated the quality of mortgages it sold to investors and agreed to pay a record $13 billion to resolve related charges. Photograph: Mike Segar/Online News JP Morgan has agreed to a record $13 billion (â¬9.6 billion) settlement after admitting it routinely overstated the quality of mortgages it was selling to investors, federal officials have said. The behaviour that the largest US bank admitted to, authorities said, is at the heart of what inflated the housing bubble: lenders making bad mortgages and selling them to investors who thought they were relatively safe. When the loans started turning bad, investors lost faith in the banking system, and a housing crisis turned into a financial crisis. The civil settlement marks the end of weeks of tense negotiations between JPMorgan Chase , which is looking to move past the legal issues that have plagued it for more than a year, and the US government, which is under pressure to hold banks accountable for behavior that led to the financial crisis. JPMorgan said it has set aside all the funds it needs to cover the settlement, meaning the deal will have no impact on its earnings. The deal resolves most of its mortgage issues with federal authorities, the bank said. JPMorganâs shares rose 0.7 per cent to close at $56.15 yesterday. But even after the settlement, the bank faces at least nine other government probes, covering everything from its hiring practices in China to whether it manipulated the Libor benchmark interest rate. It may still also face criminal charges linked to mortgage matters. The bankâs outspoken chief executive, Jamie Dimon , avoided the worst pitfalls of the financial crisis, but now is discovering he did not avoid all of them. The bank said last month it had set aside $23 billion to cover litigation expenses. Yesterday, it said it has set aside enough to cover this settlement. Meanwhile, the US justice department, which led the negotiations with JPMorgan, said that JPMorgan was not a solitary investigation. âThe justice departmentâs financial fraud investigations are far from over,â US attorney general Eric Holder said in a statement. At issue in the settlement was the long chain of parties between the original mortgage lender and the ultimate investor in the loan in the years leading up to the crisis. Often smaller lenders would make subprime mortgage loans, and sell them to a bank, which would package loans into bonds, and in turn sell them to investors. With so many middlemen, investors had poor information about what they were buying, and capital flowed to loans that arguably should never have been made. âWithout a doubt, the conduct uncovered in this investigation helped sow the seeds of the mortgage meltdown,â Mr Holder in a statement. The investors that bought these mortgage bonds demanded that the loans be of a particular quality. JPMorgan said the loans met the guidelines, but one of its employees said they did not, the bank admitted. Outside firms that reviewed some of those loans for JP Morgan in 2006 and 2007 said that 27 per cent of them did not meet underwriting guidelines, but the bank still packaged at least half of those into mortgage securities, the government said. JPMorganâs chief financial officer Marianne Lake said on a conference call that the bank did not admit to any violations of law, and does not believe the facts it admitted to have any bearing on remaining litigation. A person involved in the negotiations said the 11-page statement of fact that the bank admitted to was the subject of prolonged negotiation. Comments are closed for this article.
Keegan hails comeback king Fowler Keegan hails comeback king Fowler Manchester City boss Kevin Keegan has praised striker Robbie Fowler for his landmark return to form. The 29-year-old, out of favour at City earlier this season, took his Premiership goal tally past 150 with a brace in Monday's 3-2 win at Norwich. "He is still a quality player and knows where the net is - we have just got to supply him with ammunition and, in the end, we did," Keegan said. "He has worked hard to get back to where he is now." The former Liverpool striker, who moved to City in 2003 after a poor stint at Leeds, has battled back into first-team contention after struggling with fitness at the start of the season. Fowler overtook Les Ferdinand on Tuesday evening to become the third highest scorer of all time in the Premiership, with 151 goals, and he only trails Alan Shearer (250) and Andy Cole (173). And Keegan believes there is still more to come from the former England forward. "He can get better if we can supply him better," added Keegan. "People want to write him off but if he has kept the articles of those people who have written him off he could throw them back at them and they would be left with a bit of egg on their face." Fowler's double strike helped City come back from two goals down to clinch a dramatic win at Carrow Road and Keegan sympathised with Norwich boss Nigel Worthington afterwards. "I feel a bit for Nigel Worthington," he said. "His team have got great character, they have a lot of drive and enthusiasm. "I know it is a killer blow for Norwich but I really think they have brought something to the Premiership. "The stadium and the atmosphere is great, it is just a tough league to stay in - as they are finding out and as we know." Comments are closed for this article.
Laois teacher Melissa Honner underwent the transplant operation for her sister Alison Laois teacher Melissa Honner underwent the transplant operation for her sister Alison Sisters Alison and Melissa Honner with Joe Duffy Eoghan MacConnell A bride-to-be has given a life-saving gift by donating a kidney to her younger sister and future bridesmaid. Laois school teacher Melissa Honner (29) underwent the transplant operation for her sister Alison (27) at Beaumont Hospital on October 1st. The siblings decided to share their story to highlight the importance of organ donation and European Day for Organ Donation and Transplantation which takes place today. Alison, who previously had two failed transplants, said: âNow that Melissa has given me my life back I can look forward to the future and being her bridesmaid on her special day.â They have now returned home to the Pike of Rushall in Co Laois and are looking forward to a bright future and Melissaâs wedding in July. Failed transplants Donation was an obvious option, according to Melissa. âIt was a no-brainer that I should help my sister who was struggling with dialysis for four years after two previous transplants failed. I consider myself very fortunate to have been able to donate a kidney to Alison as for some families living donation might not be an option.â She wants the general public to support European Day for Organ Donation by having a discussion with their loved ones about organ donation. Her sister Alison, a media student, said âthe operation has been a great success and as Melissa was a perfect match the prospect of my new kidney lasting for longer is much greater. I will always be grateful to the families of the deceased donors for my previous two kidney transplants which gave me a better quality of life when I was younger.â She encouraged people to carry an organ donor card and be aware of the immense difference a transplant can make to all those people with organ failure. There are more than 650 people in Ireland awaiting organ transplants including heart, lung, liver, kidney and pancreas. Last year Alison was declared âBest Female Athlete on Dialysisâ for demonstrating great spirit and determination at the European Transplant and Dialysis Games where she secured three medals. Last year 78 donors helped 206 people receive organ transplants, 10 of whom received heart transplants at the Mater hospital in Dublin.

Latest Opera browser gets vocal Latest Opera browser gets vocal Net browser Opera 8.0, due for official release at the end of next month, will be "the most accessible browser on the market", according to its authors. The latest version of the net browser can be controlled by voice command and will read pages aloud. The voice features, based on IBM technology, are currently only available in the Windows version. Opera can also magnify text by up to 10 times and users can create "style sheets", its developers say. This will enable them to view pages with colours and fonts that they prefer. But the browser does not yet work well with screen reader software often used by blind people, so its accessibility features are more likely to appeal to those with some residual vision. "Our mission was always to provide the best internet experience for everyone," said Opera spokeswoman, Berit Hanson. "So we would obviously not want to exclude disabled computer users." Another feature likely to appeal to people with low vision is the ability to make pages fit to the screen width, which eliminates the need for horizontal scrolling. The company points out that this will also appeal to anyone using Opera with a handheld device. The company says that features like voice activation are not solely aimed at visually impaired people. "Our idea was to take a first step in making human-computer interaction more natural," said Ms Hanson. "People are not always in a situation where they can access a keyboard, so this makes the web a more hands-free experience." Unlike commercially available voice recognition software, Opera does not have to be "trained" to recognise an individual voice. Around 50 voice commands are available and users will have to wear a headset which incorporates a microphone. The voice recognition function is currently only available in English. Opera is free to download but a paid-for version comes without an ad banner in the top right hand corner and with extra support. Opera began life as a research project - a spin-off from Norwegian telecoms company Telenor. Its browser is used by an estimated 10 million people on a variety of operating systems and a number of different platforms. Return to results
Legendary Dutch boss Michels dies Legendary Dutch boss Michels dies Legendary Dutch coach Rinus Michels, the man credited with developing "total football", has died aged 77. Referred to in the Netherlands as "the General", Michels led the Dutch at the 1974 World Cup - when they reached the final only to lose 2-1 to Germany. However, he guided his side to the 1988 European Championship title with a 2-0 win over the Soviet Union in the final. Michels played for Ajax and coached the side to four national titles between 1965-71 and a European Cup in 1971. His 1970s Dutch team was built around Johan Cruyff and Johan Neeskens and introduced the concept of 'total football' to the world. The strategy was to foster team coherence and individual imagination - with all players possessing the skills to play in any part of the pitch. Cruyff was the on-field organiser of a team whose players rotated in and out of defence at will and was encouraged to play creative attacking football. Michels had recently undergone heart surgery and Dutch football federation (KNVB) spokesman Frank Huizinga said: "He was one of the best coaches we had in history." The no-nonsense coach also enjoyed spells at Barcelona, who he took to a Spanish title in 1974, FC Cologne and Bayer Leverkusen. Michels, named coach of the century by world football's governing body Fifa in 1999, also won five caps for the Netherlands as a bruising centre forward. Dutch sports minister Clemence Ross-van Dorp said: "He was the man who, together with Cruyff, made Dutch football big." Comments are closed for this article.
Liverpool pledge to keep Gerrard Liverpool pledge to keep Gerrard Liverpool chief executive Rick Parry insists the club will never sell Steven Gerrard amid reports Chelsea will renew their bid to lure him from Anfield. Gerrard reiterated his desire to win trophies with the Reds after his superb Champions League winner on Wednesday. And Parry has moved to scotch claims that Chelsea could launch a Â£35m bid. "There is no chance of Stevie going in January," said Parry. "That just won't happen. Our intention is that we will never let him go." Gerrard scored a spectacular late goal to give Liverpool a 3-1 win over Olympiakos and book their place in the knockout stages. "Of course he is ambitious but so are we," Parry added. "We firmly believe that if we can satisfy his ambition he will remain a Liverpool player. "We have an open and straightforward relationship. We both know where we stand and that played a big part in his decision to stay last summer. If he was not so committed to Liverpool he would have gone by now." Gerrard had said before Wednesday's game he would consider leaving if the club was knocked out of Europe, with Real Madrid also believed to be monitoring his situation. "The main point I have made is I want to be in a Liverpool side which challenges for the Champions League and the title all the time," he said afterwards. "I want to be winning things with Liverpool, not somewhere else. "I am a fan as well and I think what I have said the supporters will agree with. "We have to build on wins like that, not just settle for a great win and then not progress any further. "My goal was one of the most important I have ever scored and I hope it turns out to be one of the most important for the club for a long time. "I know I put a lot of pressure on myself because of what I said, and I felt I needed a big performance, but I am not going to go around telling lies about how I feel." Reds manager Rafael Benitez believes Gerrard can win everything he wants to without moving clubs. "Steven can win all he wants with us and we need him. He has seen that we have a good team and we can do more things in the future," said Benitez. "But if we want to win more games, important games, we need Steven in the team. "We need his strength, the strong mentality he has and his quality. I think he likes and wants the responsibility of leading this team." Comments are closed for this article.
Local net TV takes off in Austria Local net TV takes off in Austria An Austrian village is testing technology that could represent the future of television. The people of Engerwitzdorf are filming, editing and producing their own regional news channel. The channel covers local politics, sports, events and anything that residents want to film and are prepared to upload for others to watch on PCs. The pilot has been so successful that Telekom Austria is now considering setting up other projects elsewhere. "It's growing unbelievably fast," said Rudolf Fischer, head of Telekom Austria's fixed line division. The trial of Buntes Fernsehen (Multi-Coloured TV) was started in late 2004 and creates a net-based TV station run by the 8,000 residents of Engerwitzdorf. The hardware and software to turn video footage into edited programmes has been provided by Telekom Austria but this equipment, following training, has been turned over to the villagers. Any video programme created by the villagers is uploaded to a Buntes Fernsehen portal that lets people browse and download what they want to watch. Most people watch the TV on their home PC and a broadband connection is needed to get broadcast quality programmes. In the first four months of the project villagers have created 60 films and put together regular reports on local news items. "They have adopted it very quickly," said Mr Fischer. "They like the possibility to create their own content and see what's going on in the area." "It's kind of the democratisation of local TV," he said, "because none of the bigger broadcasters would ever do anything like this for that region." The Buntes Fernsehen project has been such a success that Telekom Austria is now considering setting up other schemes in similarly rural areas. Mr Fischer said it was taking the roll-out to other areas slowly because of the work involved in setting up the scheme, getting backers from local government and educating people how to make programmes. The Engerwitzdorf scheme is an outgrowth of Telekom Austria's online TV channel Aon which lets people watch programmes on their PC. Aon streams a couple of live channels, plus sports, news and music programmes on to the net and has a pay-for-download section that lets people watch what they want when they want to watch it. In October a larger TV-on-demand project is due to launch in Vienna that will let people download many programmes from the net. Comments are closed for this article.
Looks and music to drive mobiles Looks and music to drive mobiles Mobile phones are still enjoying a boom time in sales, according to research from technology analysts Gartner. More than 674 million mobiles were sold last year globally, said the report, the highest total sold to date. The figure was 30% more than in 2003 and surpassed even the most optimistic predictions, Gartner said. Good design and the look of a mobile, as well as new services such as music downloads, could go some way to pushing up sales in 2005, said analysts. Although people were still looking for better replacement phones, there was evidence, according to Gartner, that some markets were seeing a slow-down in replacement sales. "All the markets grew apart from Japan which shows that replacement sales are continuing in western Europe," mobile analyst Carolina Milanesi told the Online News News website. "Japan is where north America and western European markets can be in a couple of years' time. "They already have TV, music, ringtones, cameras, and all that we can think of on mobiles, so people have stopped buying replacement phones." But there could be a slight slowdown in sales in European and US markets too, according to Gartner, as people wait to see what comes next in mobile technology. This means mobile companies have to think carefully about what they are offering in new models so that people see a compelling reason to upgrade, said Gartner. Third generation mobiles (3G) with the ability to handle large amounts of data transfer, like video, could drive people into upgrading their phones, but Ms Milanesi said it was difficult to say how quickly that would happen. "At the end of the day, people have cameras and colour screens on mobiles and for the majority of people out there who don't really care about technology the speed of data to a phone is not critical." Nor would the rush to produce two or three megapixel camera phones be a reason for mobile owners to upgrade on its own. The majority of camera phone models are not at the stage where they can compete with digital cameras which also have flashes and zooms. More likely to drive sales in 2005 would be the attention to design and aesthetics, as well as music services. The Motorola Razr V3 phone was typical of the attention to design that would be more commonplace in 2005, she added. This was not a "women's thing", she said, but a desire from men and women to have a gadget that is a form of self-expression too. It was not just about how the phone functioned, but about what it said about its owner. "Western Europe has always been a market which is quite attentive to design," said Ms Milanesi. "People are after something that is nice-looking, and together with that, there is the entertainment side. "This year music will have a part to play in this." The market for full-track music downloads was worth just $20 million (Â£10.5 million) in 2004, but is set to be worth $1.8 billion (Â£9.4 million) by 2009, according to Jupiter Research. Sony Ericsson just released its Walkman branded mobile phone, the W800, which combines a digital music player with up to 30 hours' battery life, and a two megapixel camera. In July last year, Motorola and Apple announced a version of iTunes online music downloading service would be released which would be compatible with Motorola mobile phones. Apple said the new iTunes music player would become Motorola's standard music application for its music phones. But the challenge will be balancing storage capacity with battery life if mobile music hopes to compete with digital music players like the iPod. Ms Milanesi said more models would likely be released in the coming year with hard drives. But they would be more likely to compete with the smaller capacity music players that have around four gigabyte storage capacity, which would not put too much strain on battery life.

Man Utd urged to seal Giggs deal Man Utd urged to seal Giggs deal Ryan Giggs' agent has told Manchester United to end the deadlock surrounding the Welsh winger's contract. Giggs is signed up until 2006 and the 31-year-old is looking for a new two-year deal as he bids to end his playing days at Old Trafford. However, United have only offered a one-year extension in line with their policy of contract negotiations with players over 30. "I don't think he is asking for the world," said agent Harry Swales. He added: "We are not banging on desks and slamming doors. We are just waiting for the gentlemen in grey suits to get back in touch with us. "Ryan isn't asking for any more money and he certainly doesn't want to leave Manchester United. "If he had his way, he would stay with them for the rest of his career. "We have got on well with the board at United and long may that continue. But just at the moment, the ball is in their court." Newcastle and Bolton are reportedly interested in signing the midfielder, who has been one of the main influences behind United's success over the last decade. However, Giggs has always insisted that he is keen to end his career at Old Trafford.
Microsoft gets the blogging bug Microsoft gets the blogging bug Software giant Microsoft is taking the plunge into the world of blogging. It is launching a test service to allow people to publish blogs, or online journals, called MSN Spaces. Microsoft is trailing behind competitors like Google and AOL, which already offer services which make it easy for people to set up web journals. Blogs, short for web logs, have become a popular way for people to talk about their lives and express opinions online. MSN Spaces is free to anyone with a Hotmail or MSN Messenger account. People will be able to choose a layout for the page, upload images and share photo albums and music playlists. The service will be supported by banner ads. "This is a simple tool for people to express themselves," said MSN's Blake Irving. This is Microsoft's first foray into blogging, which has taken off as a web phenomenon in the past year. Competitors like Google already offer free services through its Blogger site, while AOL provides its members with journals. Accurate figures for the number of blogs in existence are hard to come by. According to blog analysis firm Technorati, the so-called blogosphere, has doubled every five and a half months for the last 18 months. It now estimates that the number of blogs in existence has exceeded 4.8 million, although some speculate that less than a quarter are regularly maintained. Comments are closed for this article.
Most Germans believe other businesses and economies should be more competitive, not that Germany sho... Most Germans believe other businesses and economies should be more competitive, not that Germany should throttle its booming exports Press conferences of Germanyâs economic advisory council are usually a sober affair. The groupâs official German name, the SachverstÃ¤ndigenrat, is such a multi-syllable mouthful that theyâre known unofficially as the five wise men â even if one of the men is now a woman. Their seasonal Berlin appearances involve the five economists handing over a doorstopper report to chancellor Angela Merkel, 502 pages, this week. They exchange a few pleasantries and then hold a press conference where they try to out-do each other with dry, airless analysis. Not this time. Before the eyes of the delighted Berlin press pack on Wednesday, the five wise men turned into the five bickering men â and woman. The row reached a peak when they were asked about the announcement of a European Commission investigation into whether Germanyâs trade surplus breaches the EU stability rulebook. When one of the council members, Prof Peter Bofinger , called the criticisms of Germany justified, the other four disagreed vigorously. As the cameras rolled, they exchanged arguments about the trade surplus and Germanyâs current account surplus. Although not new, it was unusual to hear the arguments debated so vigorously and so publicly in Germany. Driving the debate is the sheer scale of Germanyâs exports over imports: climbing rapidly since 2009, Germany is on course to post a record surplus of â¬200 billion this year. A long-running argument has taken on a new urgency. The latest round in this debate was triggered by the US treasury report last month criticising Germanyâs over-reliance on exports, its high current-account surplus and weak domestic demand. Combined, these factors âhave hampered rebalancing at a time when many other euro-area countries have been under severe pressureâ, the report concluded, with an eye on budget consolidation in the euro zone periphery. âThe net result has been a deflationary bias for the euro area, as well as for the world economy.â A whoâs who of international voices has, since then, backed the US: the French president, the Italian prime minister and the president of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Christine Lagarde , among others. In 2010, as French finance minister, Lagarde argued that Berlinâs export-driven boom and much-vaunted trade surplus were built on low labour costs that was costing its neighbours dear. As well as imposing deficit limits, surplus countries had a role to play in the currency blocâs recovery by driving domestic demand, she said, noting that it âtakes two to tangoâ. Prompt and blunt The German reaction, as always, is prompt and blunt. The economics ministry said the surplus was âa sign of the competitiveness of the German economy and global demand for quality products from Germanyâ. In other words, Germany is the solution, not the problem. It is up to others in Europe to make their economies and companies more competitive as Germany has done, not for Germany to throttle its booming export business. âTo urge Real Madrid to side-line Cristiano Ronaldo would not help Malaga win the European Champions League,â wrote Prof Thomas Straubhaar , economist with Hamburgâs HWWI economist institute, in Die Welt newspaper. âIt would weaken the Spanish soccer league as a whole and would give the teams from other countries a better chance to win the tournament.â The irony of this weekâs news from Brussels is that Germany only has itself to thank for the EU investigation. As a lesson of the euro zone crisis, Berlin, along with other capitals, pushed to hand the commission more differentiated means to flag economic problems before they became an existential threat. Existing instruments for public debt levels were supplemented with a tool to monitor excessive surpluses. The argument for this was that surpluses can also have a damaging and distorting effect on a currency bloc. .

Mourinho plots impressive course Mourinho plots impressive course Chelsea's win at Fulham - confirming their position at the Premiership summit - proves that they now have everything in place to mount serious challenges on all fronts this season. They have got strength in depth, great players, an outstanding manager in Jose Mourinho and finances no other club in the world can match. All they need to add now is the big prizes which, as we all know, is the most difficult part of all. One thing is certain - they have put themselves in a position to make that leap to success very impressively indeed. They beat a very tough Everton at Stamford Bridge, won at Newcastle in the Carling Cup, and then won 4-1 at Fulham, which was a great result given that they had been showing good form. As I said, winning the major honours is the hardest task of all, but in Mourinho they have a manager who will make it a whole lot easier to handle the anticipation and expectation that will come their way now. Mourinho has won the biggest club prize of all, the Champions League, and that track record and confidence transmits itself to top players. It is a priceless commodity. No-one can be anything other than highly-impressed by Mourinho. He is regarded as a touch arrogant by some people, and maybe he can appear that way, but he has the silverware to back up the talk. Mourinho doesn't simply talk a good game - he's won some very big games such as the Champions League final with Porto. Some may criticise his talk, but the words are backed up with actions. I've also found him to be very realistic whenever I've heard him. He's spent a lot of money and it seems to be working, and we should remember lots of managers have spent money and it has not worked. The buys are now integrating, and in Arjen Robben he has the player who is giving them that extra dimension. In the early games he was slaughtered for defensive tactics, and yet he was winning games. You cannot win titles early on in the season, but you can certainly lose them and those points on the board were vital. I also thought the criticism was very harsh, because even though they were not scoring goals they were creating chances by the hatful. Now they are taking those chances, have the double threat of Robben and Damien Duff, and things are looking good. I just wonder if they lack a predator, particularly with Didier Drogba injured. He was starting to look the part before he was sidelined, but you have to feel if Chelsea had a Ruud van Nistelrooy they would be even more of a safe bet for the title. Chelsea also have all the tools to go far in the Champions League. I felt they would never have a better chance than last season, but they have swept all before them in Europe so far this season. It will now be very interesting to see how Mourinho prioritises things, but his life will be made easier by the size of Chelsea's squad. I have said I believed Chelsea would win the league this season, even when Arsenal were flying at the start, and I have seen nothing to make me change me mind. If anything, what I have seen has confirmed my early impressions. And Chelsea would have taken encouragement from Arsenal's rocky defensive display at Spurs, even though they ran out 5-4 winners. Mourinho had his say on that game, complaining: "Five-four is a hockey score, not a football score. "In a three-against-three training match, if the score reaches 5-4 I send the players back to the dressing rooms as they are not defending properly. "So to get a result like that in a game of 11 against 11 is disgraceful." On a more serious note, it was a game that merely confirmed the importance of Sol Campbell to Arsenal. Much criticism has been aimed at Pascal Cygan, but I believe the problem lies with the absence of Campbell and its overall effect on Arsenal's defence. Confidence is a crucial factor in defending. When you start conceding goals, you suddenly get a chill in the bones every time the ball comes into the penalty area. You think "oh no" - then find your worst fears confirmed. Arsenal need to reverse the process, with or without Campbell, and get some clean sheets on the board. But the return of Campbell is key. He solidifies the unit, has pace and is powerful in the air and on the deck. He is vastly experienced and has a calming influence on all around him. Campbell pulls it all together at the back and gets the defence playing as a unit. Chelsea have no such problems at present, which is why I would still place my money on them to edge out Arsenal as champions this season. Comments are closed for this article.
Movie body hits peer-to-peer nets Movie body hits peer-to-peer nets The movie industry has struck out at file-sharing networks with another round of lawsuits in the US. The Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) also said it had succeeded in getting a network called LokiTorrent closed down. It is the latest network which uses the peer-to-peer system called BitTorrent to be hit by the MPAA. The MPAA began its legal campaign against operators of similar networks across four continents in December. A Dallas court agreed that Hollywood lawyers would be allowed access to LokiTorrent's server records which could let them single out those who were sharing files illegally. In October 2004, the site had provided links to more than 30,000 files. The action came after the operators of LokiTorrent agreed a settlement with the MPAA. A stark message has appeared on the site from the MPAA warning "You can click, but you can't hide". In BitTorrent systems, server sites do not host the files being shared. They host links, called "trackers" that direct people to others that have it instead. As well as filing an unspecified number of file suits across the US, the MPAA said it had given operators that host eDonkey servers "take down" notices. Hollywood studios are aggressively clamping down on file-sharers who it says infringe copyright laws by copying films and TV programmes then share the files online. But it is now targeting the operators of BitTorrent networks themselves. It has filed 100 lawsuits against operators of BitTorrent server sites since December. The strategy of hitting those who run the servers which link to copyrighted material is intended to stunt file-sharers' ability to swap content using BitTorrent systems. The film industry says the black market for illegally copied videos and DVDs already costs them billions every year and it is worried that illegal file-sharing is adding to their losses. In December, the legal action claimed its most high-profile victim. The popular Suprnova.org website was forced to close, and others like Phoenix Torrent followed soon after.

New pricing structure for cholesterol-lowering drugs New pricing structure for cholesterol-lowering drugs Decision is part of long-awaited programme to replace some branded drugs with generic alternatives It is estimated a patient prescribed 10mg of atorvastatin, which is the active ingredient in lipitor, should see savings of â¬180 per year. The Government has said that prices for atorvastatin products â drugs which are used to control cholesterol â are to be reduced. The move forms part of the latest phase of the Governmentâs reference pricing initiative aimed at curbing expenditure on its bill for medicines. From today a new price regime applies to atorvastatin, which is the active ingredient in the most commonly prescribed statin. The reduction will apply to the branded drug Lipitor and generic equivalents. It said that reference pricing would see both patients and taxpayers benefit from reduced costs. An estimated 250,000 Irish residents are using a form of statin. Minister for Health James Reilly said: the introduction of a first reference price for a medicine which is used to control cholesterol,â represents a major step in ensuring lower prices are paid for these medicinesâ. âThe new reference prices for atorvastatin products means the HSE now pay 70 per cent less for these products compared to May 2013. Patients will save on the cost of their medication and taxpayers will benefit from the reduced prices paid by the HSE.â Minister of State at the Department of Health Alex White said: âThe introduction of reference prices will ensure that generic medicine prices in Ireland will fall towards European norms. It will safeguard value for money for the taxpayer and will mean that prices are set at levels which facilitate - not jeopardise - supply of these products in Ireland. Under the new pricing structure it is estimated that a patient prescribed 10mg of atorvastatin should see savings of â¬180 per year, while those on 20mg doses should save â¬280. .

Nine failures of the blanket bank guarantee â and its sole âsuccessâ Nine failures of the blanket bank guarantee â and its sole âsuccessâ The benefits we were promised five years ago have proved illusory. The costs have been locked in for decades Brian Lenihan, the then minister for finance, said he was told by Jean-Claude Trichet: âyou must save your banks at all costsâ. We are now five years on from the blanket bank guarantee. Let us ask, as calmly as we can, two basic questions. What were our aims in putting â¬100 billion (including the cost of Nama) into the banks? And were those aims achieved? If we analyse the official statements of the time, we can break the reasoning behind the guarantee into ten distinct aims. We can then ask, objectively, whether the â¬100 billion gamble paid off. All unattributed quotes here are from for finance. 1 To save the State massive amounts of money. âWeâve had the cheapest bailout in the world so far.â (November 2008) Result: FAIL. The bailout is proportionally the most expensive bank rescue in history. 2 To ensure no bank be allowed to collapse: âAs a country, we cannot afford to have the message going out that we will let a bank fail.â (January 2009). âThe fundamental question that arises in connection with the guarantee concerns the fact that the Government decided it could not let a bank fail.â (June 2009) Result: FAIL. Two of the six covered institutions, Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide, have since been liquidated. A third, EBS, has in effect disappeared as an independent entity. 3 In particular, to rescue Anglo Irish: âAnglo is a major financial institution, with a current balance sheet in excess of â¬88 billion and a substantial deposit base, whose viability is of systemic importance to the economy.â (November 2009) âWinding up the bank is not and was never a viable option.â (March 2010) Result: FAIL 4 To avoid the nationalisation. âI do really want to scotch the idea that there are huge risks to the taxpayer in the valuation process [for Bank of Ireland and AIB] because we are not nationalising these institutions.â (February 2009) Result: FAIL 5 To invest public money in the banks as a commercial proposition with a good return. âWe are going to commit an investment for a definite return to the taxpayer. This is not bailing out the banks. This is a commercial investment for the State.â (February 2009) The State would âhold valuable shares in our two main banks which can realise gains for the citizens of this countryâ. (March 2010) Result: FAIL. There is no chance of a commercial return on the taxpayerâs â¬100 billion investment. If we were to get half of that back, it would be a miracle. 6 To âget credit flowingâ: âMy overriding concern throughout this financial crisis has been to get credit to viable businesses, particularly SMEs, which will lead our way out of this recession.â (February 2009) Result: FAIL. Almost half of SMEs say banks are not lending to their sector. Ireland has by far the lowest level of investment in the EU. .

Nintendo DS aims to touch gamers Nintendo DS aims to touch gamers The mobile gaming industry is set to explode in 2005 with a number of high-profile devices offering a range of gaming and other features such as movie and music playback. Market leader Nintendo, however, is releasing a handheld console that it says will revolutionise the way games are played. The first striking thing about the DS is how retro it looks. Far from looking like a mould-breaking handheld, it looks more like Nintendo dug out a mould from a 1980s handheld prototype. The lightweight clam shell device opens up to reveal two screens, and when switched on it instantly reveals its pedigree. Both screens are crisp and clear while the bottom of the two is touch sensitive. Nintendo has given developers free rein to utilise the dual screens and ability to control the action by simply touching the screen. The Japanese gaming giant hopes the DS will maintain the firm's pre-eminence in an increasingly-competitive mobile gaming market. Nintendo first launched its GameBoy console in 1989 and has dominated the market ever since. But its lead can no longer be taken for granted. Sony will enter the market later this year with its PlayStation Portable, while start-up companies Gizmondo and Tapwave Zodiac are also offering hybrid devices. "We believe the DS will appeal to all ages, both genders and gamers of any skill," said David Yarnton, Nintendo Europe's general manager said at the recent press launch for the handheld. With its two screens, wireless connectivity and backwards compatibility with the GameBoy Advance, the DS certainly has a number of unique selling points. It went on sale in the US in mid-November priced $150 and Nintendo says sales have exceeded expectations, without giving detailed figures. Japan and Europe will have to wait until the first quarter of 2005 to get the device. With more than two million pre-orders for the device in Japan, Nintendo is confident it will keep its number one spot. But will the device prove to be as revolutionary as claimed? The game ships with a demo of Metroid Hunters - a 3D action title which can be played alone or with a group of friends using the machine's wireless capabilities. It certainly looks impressive on the small machine and plays smoothly even with a group of people. The game can be controlled by using the supplied stylus to aim. The top screen is used to navigate the action while the bottom screen offers a top-down map and the ability to switch weapons. It is certainly a unique control method and while it makes aiming more controlled it can be a little disorientating. Super Mario 64 DS is a faithful re-creation of the Nintendo 64 classic with a host of new mini-games and new levels. The game looks stunning on the portable machine and the sound too is impressive for such a small machine. One thing is for certain. Hardened gamers will have to learn to adapt to a new way of playing while it could prove to be an accessible way in to gaming for novices, Ultimately the success or failure of the device lies in the hands of developers. If they manage to create titles which use the Nintendo DS's key features then a whole new market of gamers could open up. The fear is that the touch screen and voice recognition are treated as little more than gimmicks. Return to results
Nintendo DS makes its Euro debut Nintendo DS makes its Euro debut Nintendo's DS handheld game console has officially gone on sale in Europe. Many stores around the UK opened at midnight to let keen gamers get their hands on the device. The two-screen clamshell gadget costs Â£99 (149 euros) and 15 games are available for it at launch, some featuring well-known characters such as Super Mario and Rayman. The DS spearheads Nintendo's attempt to continue its dominance of the handheld gaming market. Since going on sale in Japan and the US at the end of 2004, Nintendo has sold almost 4m DS consoles. Part of this popularity may be due to the fact that the DS can run any of the catalogue of 700 games produced for Nintendo's GameBoy Advance handheld. Games for the DS are expected to cost between Â£19 and Â£29. About 130 games for the DS are in development. As well as having two screens, one of which is controlled by touch, the DS also lets players take on up to 16 other people via wireless. A "download play" option means DS owners can take each other on even if only one of them owns a copy of a particular game. Other DS owners can also be sent text messages and drawings. Nintendo is also planning to release a media adapter for the handheld so it can play music and video. Five Virgin megastores and 150 Game shops were expected to open early on Friday morning to let people buy a DS. "We know that customers want it as soon as it's released - and that means the minute, not the day," said Robert Quinn, Game's UK sales director. But Nintendo will only have sole control of Europe's handheld gaming market for a few weeks because soon Sony is expected to release its PSP console. Although Nintendo is aiming for younger players and the PSP is more for older gamers, it is likely that the two firms will be competing for many of the same customers. Sony's PSP represents a real threat to Nintendo because of the huge number of PlayStation owners around the world and the greater flexibility of the sleek black gadget. The PSP uses small discs for games, can play music and movies without the need for add-ons and also supports short-range wireless play. When it goes on sale the PSP is likely to cost between Â£130 and Â£200. Return to results
Nobel winner Stiglitz warns of Irelandâs âlost decadeâ Nobel winner Stiglitz warns of Irelandâs âlost decadeâ Decision to bail out the bondholders was âdeep mistakeâ Joseph Stiglitz said Ireland was facing a lost decade as a result of the bailout. Photograph: Daniel Acker/Online News Ireland is facing a lost decade as a result of the Troika bailout, Nobel Memorial Prize winner Joseph Stiglitz said, as the country neared the end of its bailout programme. Speaking on RTE Radio One, Mr Stiglitz said it was a âdeep mistakeâ to bail out the bondholders. He said he was âastonishedâ at how Irish people accepted the situation without protest. âA good share of the blame has to go to the ECB and commission for not restructuring the debts,â Mr Stiglitz said. He said it was the ECB and others who wanted to save the banks, âso it was a trade off between banks all over Europe and the Irish citizensâ. Mr Stiglitz predicted a âlost decadeâ for the Irish economy before it got back on its feet, and the country would be unlikely to get back on the growth path it was previously on. âWill you get back to where you were with maybe a lost decade? Yes, I think you will. But it will be a lost decade, at least.â Austerity âessentially never workedâMr Stiglitz said. However, he said the decision to stay in the euro was probably the right one. His comments came as the Troikaâs final review said irelnadâs programme remains âon track in the context of the nascent economic recoveryâ. The final report noted the high unemployment rate, but welcomed steps to improve employment incentives and plans for private sector provision of employment services. âAdditional redeployment of resources is needed to ensure meaningful engagement with job seekers, especially the long-term unemployed, and to provide training relevant to the job market,â a statement from the Troika said. .

Northâs private sector employment rising at fastest rate since 2007 Northâs private sector employment rising at fastest rate since 2007 Latest figures show that recent trends in the Northern economy are sustained The latest figures show that recent trends in the Northern economy are sustained and not the product of one-off events Private sector employment is rising at the fastest rate since the advent of the crash in 2007, the latest Purchasing managers Index (PMI) for Northern Ireland has shown. The index, produced for the Ulster Bank by Markit, also highlights a solid rise in employment generally, the easing of inflation pressures and a fourth successive rise in output. The latest figures, published on Monday show that recent trends in the Northern economy are sustained and not the product of one-off events such as the World Police and Fire Games held in Belfast during the summer or the staging of the All-Ireland Fleadh in Derry in August. The headline seasonally adjusted Business Activity Index posted 57.6 in October from 58.7 in September, signalling another strong expansion of private sector output in October, although the rate of growth remained slower than the UK economy average. All four sectors posted higher activity. Where output rose, panellists mainly linked this to higher new orders. New business rose markedly, extending the current sequence of expansion to five months. In the labour market, higher workloads fed through to rises in both backlogs of work and employment during October. Staffing levels increased for the fourth consecutive month, although the rate of job creation at Northern Ireland companies was slower than recorded across the UK economy as a whole. On the inflation front, the rate of input cost inflation slowed from Septemberâs 17-month high and was weaker than the series average. However the rise in input costs was still faster than the UK average. Where input prices increased, this was partly linked to higher energy costs, while some respondents mentioned a rise in the UK minimum wage. âNorthern Irelandâs private sector firms have started the fourth quarter the way they finished the third quarter with business activity, new orders and employment all on the rise,â said Richard Ramsey , the bankâs chief economist in Northern Ireland. âWhile the pace of business activity eased relative to the September survey, local firms still posted a robust rate of growth last month. Meanwhile the rate of growth in new orders held steady which should provide momentum going into 2014.â The significant acceleration in output, new orders and employment in the UK and the Republic are also encouraging, he added âas our firms are exposed to the economic fortunes of these two economies more so than any other economyâ. âAs far as the October PMIs were concerned, the UK and the Republic of Ireland were two of the best performing economies worldwide. In Northern Ireland, the recovery remains broad based with all sectors signalling higher levels of activity last month. Meanwhile, construction posted its fastest rate of growth in output and employment since the series began. However, it should be remembered that these increases are coming off extremely low levels.â Comments are closed for this article.
Online News leads interactive Bafta wins Online News leads interactive Bafta wins The Online News and the National Theatre have led the field at this year's Interactive Bafta awards. The National Theatre's Stagework website picked up the prize for best learning as well as top factual site. The Online News collected three awards, including best online entertainment for the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Adventure Game. Spooks Interactive took the best interactive TV prize. The annual awards recognise the best in digital media. Online News Sport Interactive fought off competition from COnline News Newsround and the Online News to take home the best news and sport trophy for its coverage of England's exit from Euro 2004. It was recognised for its "groundbreaking" use of animation. Bafta's Grant Dean, chair of Bafta's Interactive Entertainment committee, said all the entrants had been of "outstanding quality" and that judging had been "enormously difficult". "Without a doubt, 2005 has been a landmark year for the Bafta Interactive Awards," he added. "Many of the top awards this year have gone to the companies we most commonly associate with traditional entertainment, showing how the gap between new media, film and television is closing." Awards were given out in 12 different categories, including interactive TV, film, music, design, as well as technical and social innovation, at a London ceremony. The top music award was given to SSEYO miniMIXA, a mobile music sequencer designed to let people write, edit and share compositions. Warner Bros was given two prizes for its "inspiring" efforts in film and DVD interactivity. The Chaplin Collection beat Oasis, Really Bend It Like Beckham, Shaun of the Dead and The Day Today in the DVD category, and Trauma won best film. Elsewhere, fashionista and clothes designer Alexander McQueen took the accolade for the best-designed website. The awards have been running since 1997, but in 2002 the British Academy of Film and Television decided to split them into separate games and interactive ceremonies. On Tuesday Half-Life 2 dominated the games prizes. It collected six Baftas, including best game and best online game. Return to results
Professional and local interests had stake in keeping aslyums, says major study Professional and local interests had stake in keeping aslyums, says major study Mental institutions âcanât be blamed on the church; it was a State-run projectâ Dr Damien Brennan: âThere was a harshness and dehumanising aspect that was very much like the Magdalene laundryâ Medical professionals and local communities protecting their economic interests played a major role in the incarceration of tens of thousands of people in asylums, according to a study into whatâs depicted as the forgotten scandal of Irelandâs institutional past. Its author, Dr Damien Brennan , said there were strong parallels between the operation of Irelandâs mental hospitals and the Magdalene laundries but the former âcanât be blamed on the church; it was a State-run project. We did it as communities, as societiesâ. In his book Irish Insanity: 1800-2000, the culmination of 10 years of research launched in Dublin last night, he seeks to explain why Ireland in the 1950s had the worldâs highest rate of mental hospital residency. Dr Brennan, assistant professor at the school of nursing and midwifery, Trinity College Dublin , argues it âhad little to do with the mental state of the admitted individualsâ. Rather, it was driven by factors such as law, economics and vested interests, including the creation of a medical treatment hierarchy that âcontinues todayâ. âThe staff had a stake in this. The medics and nurses had their professional interests in this. Economically, it became very important, and it became a snowballing institutional development,â said Dr Brennan, whose PhD work on the subject informed the late Mary Rafteryâs Behind the Walls documentary series. âThese are the largest institutions of confinement in our State, much bigger than all of the others added together. But they havenât attracted the same scrutiny or critical review as those institutions which worked as church-State partnerships.â Harsh âdehumanisingâ Dr Brennan, who worked as a mental health nurse in St Lomanâs, Grangegorman and Portrane, said he had no knowledge of physical beatings or sexual abuse in hospitals but âthere was a harshness and dehumanising aspect that was very much like the Magdalene laundryâ. âI think there is a reluctance to take this on,â he continued. âPeople who spent three months in a laundry are getting redress â and I donât want to bring it back to money â but why arenât psychiatric hospitals even of interest post the McAleese report? âI know patients who spent 30, 40, sometimes 50 years in these places, and we havenât even conceptualised how they might have been damaged by the institutions.â He pointed out the McAleese report examined about 10,000 women who went through the laundries, whereas more than double that could be found in asylums on any one night in the 1950s, making this âthe biggest story regarding institutional settingsâ in Irish history.

Public finances remain on track for 2013 Public finances remain on track for 2013 Lastest returns show tax and spending both as projected at this stage of 2013 Minister for Finance Michael Noonan at Government Buildings. File photograph: Brenda Fitzsimons / The Online News. The public finances remain on target for 2013 with just two months remaining, figures released by the Department of Finance today show. The exchequer deficit at the end of October was â¬10.5 billion, which is a â¬3.5 billion improvement over the first ten months of last year. Tax revenues were â¬29.24 billion at the end of October, which is â¬37 million, or 0.1 per cent, above target. Net voted expenditure was â¬35.3 billion, or â¬844 million (2.3 per cent) below target. Income tax was 3 per cent down on a monthly target of â¬1.36 billion, with the shortfall being attributed to weak DIRT, which is a tax on savings. Overall, income tax of â¬12.13 billion was collected in the first ten months of the year, compared to an expected â¬12.25 billion. Excise duties were â¬3.85 billion, which was 1.3 per cent behind target, at the end of October. However they recorded a surplus against target for October of â¬110 million. The boost is likely to have been caused by people making purchases before budget day. Local property tax receipts at the end of October were â¬215 million. On the expenditure side, the cost of servicing the national debt for the first ten months of the year was â¬7.2 billion, or 16.7 per cent higher than was the case during the same period last year. Gross voted expenditure was â¬688 million, or 1.5 per cent, below projections, with â¬339 million of this arising on the current side and â¬349 million on the capital. Spending by the Department of Health, at â¬10.7 billion at the end of October, was 0.4 per cent ahead of projections, and 0.5 per cent down on the same period last year.

Report on EI shows âmajor flawsâ in jobs strategy - Fianna Fail Report on EI shows âmajor flawsâ in jobs strategy - Fianna Fail Unpublished document recommends cutting back on workload as key staff depart Fianna Failâs spokesman on Jobs and Enterprise Dara Calleary said he would seek an early meeting with Enterprise Ireland and Minister for Enterprise Richard Bruton. Fianna Fail has accused the Government of having âmajor flawsâ in its jobs strategy after a report on Enterprise Irelandâs current operations recommended cutting back on its workload. The unpublished report, which was revealed by RTÃ, said the loss of key staff meant the agency was at significant risk of failing to deliver some of its key services to exporting companies. One in four of the 740 staff at Enterprise Ireland have been switched into new roles with limited training or upskilling since a moratorium was imposed on public sector recruitment in 2009, RTÃ said. A spokesman for Enterprise Ireland said the agency had been affected by the moratorium, like all State departments and agencies, and it was in ongoing discussions with its parent department on staffing requirements. He said the agency had recently been given the go ahead to recruit an additional 20 people for its overseas offices and fill two senior management positions. â Like our clients we are constantly striving to do more with less and innovate with regard to the way we do business. Enterprise Ireland has always evolved to meet the needs of our clients by introducing new offers and services such as competitive start funds. This requires staff to take on new roles on an ongoing base to effectively respond to client needs,â he said. Fianna Failâs spokesman on Jobs and Enterprise Dara Calleary called for the report to be debated at the Oireachtas Committee on Jobs, and said he would write to the chairman to seek an early meeting with the agency and Minister for Enterprise Richard Bruton . He described reports of the contents of the document as âextremely worryingâ. âThe fact that Enterprise Ireland is looking at ways to reduce its current workload underlines the need for more resources and more of a focus on government on jobs and investment,â he said. âThe loss of knowledge and experience at the agency is very serious and the need for up-skilling based on the media reports is compelling. We have been pointing out for some time the significant flaws in the Governmentâs jobs strategy and this appears to be confirmed in this report.â He said the Government had not spent all the funding it had set aside for job creation under the Jobs Initiative. âThe simple fact of the matter is more resources need to be made available for the creation and investment agencies to enable existing companies to export and grow and for new businesses to get off the ground,â he said. âThe Government needs to encourage this instead of standing in the way.â Enterprise Ireland plays a major role in supporting companies in Ireland, responsible for thousands of jobs and billions of euro in exports from Ireland.

Rolling out next generation's net Rolling out next generation's net The body that oversees how the net works, grows and evolves says it has coped well with its growth in the last 10 years, but it is just the start. "In a sense, we have hardly started in reaching the whole population," the new chair of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), Brian Carpenter, says. The IETF ensures the smooth running and organisation of the net's architecture. With broadband take-up growing, services like voice and TV will open up interesting challenges for the net. "I think VoIP (Voice-over Internet Protocol, allowing phone calls to be made over the Net) is very important - it challenges all the old cost models of telecoms," says Dr Carpenter. "Second, it challenges more deeply the business model that you have to be a service provider with a lot of infrastructure. With VoIP, you need very little infrastructure." A distinguished IBM engineer, Dr Carpenter spent 20 years at Cern, the European Laboratory for Particle Physics. As the new chair of the IETF, his next big challenge is overseeing IPv6, the next generation standard for information transfer and routing across the web. At Cern, Dr Carpenter helped pioneer advanced net applications during the development of the world wide web, so he is well-placed to take on such a task. The net's growth and evolution depend on standards and protocols, and ensuring the architecture works and talks to other standards is a crucial job of the IETF. The top priority is to ensure that the standards that make the net work, are open and free for anyone to use and work with. The net is built on a protocol called TCP/IP, which means transmission control protocol, and internet protocol. When computers communicate with the net, a unique IP address is used to send and receive information. The IETF is a large international community of network designers, operators, vendors, and researchers working on the evolution of the net's architecture and the way this information is sent and received. They make sure it all knits together leaving no gaps. "We've seen some interesting effects over last few years," explains Dr Carpenter. "The net was growing at a fantastic rate at the end of the 90s. Then there was a bit of a glitch in 2000. "We are now seeing a very clear phase of consolidation and renewed growth." That renewed growth is also being buoyed by emerging economies, like China, which are showing fast uptake of broadband net and other technologies. The number of broadband subscribers via DSL (Digital Subscriber Line) doubled in a year to 13 million, according to figures released at the end of 2004. "The challenges we face are about continuing to produce standards to allow for that growth rate," explained Dr Carpenter. "Given it [the net] was designed for the whole community, it has done well to reach millions. If you want to reach the whole population, you have to make sure it can scale up." IPv6, the standard that will replace the existing IPv4, will allow for billions more addresses on the net, and it is gradually being worked into network infrastructure across the world. "The actual number of addresses with IPv4 is limited to four billion IP addresses. "That clearly is not enough when you have 10 billion people to serve, so there is technical solution, the new version of IP - IPv6. "It has much larger address space possibilities with no practical limits," said Dr Carpenter. Standards are vital to something as complex as the net, and making sure standards are open and can work with across networks is a big task. The difference this next generation standard, IPv6, will make to the average net user is almost invisible. "Our first goal is that it [IPv6] should make no difference - people should not notice a difference. "It is like when the London telephone numbers got longer. A lot of the process will be invisible. "People are usually given an IP address without knowing it." Technically deployment has started and the standards for are just about settled, said Dr Carpenter. The one problem with the net that may never disappear completely is security. To Dr Carpenter, the solution comes out of technological and human behaviour. People have to be educated about "sensible behaviour" he says, such as ignoring e-mails that claim you have won something. "I don't think it is going to get worse. People will remain concerned about security and they probably should do - just as you would be concerned walking along a dark street. "We have to do work to make sure there are better security internet standards. It is a never-ending battle in a sense." But, he adds: "Even if security has improved, you still worry a bit. Unfortunately, it is just part of life. We have a duty to do what we can." Return to results
Security warning over 'FBI virus' Security warning over 'FBI virus' The US Federal Bureau of Investigation is warning that a computer virus is being spread via e-mails that purport to be from the FBI. The e-mails show that they have come from an fbi.gov address and tell recipients that they have accessed illegal websites. The messages warn that their internet use has been monitored by the FBI's Internet Fraud Complaint Center. An attachment in the e-mail contains the virus, the FBI said. The message asks recipients to click on the attachment and answer some questions about their internet use. But rather than being a questionnaire, the attachment contains a virus that infects the recipient's computer, according to the agency. It is not clear what the virus does once it has infected a computer. Users are warned never to open attachment from unsolicited e-mails or from people they do not know. "Recipients of this or similar solicitations should know that the FBI does not engage in the practice of sending unsolicited e-mails to the public in this manner," the FBI said in a statement. The bureau is investigating the phoney e-mails. The agency earlier this month shut down fbi.gov accounts, used to communicate with the public, because of a security breach. A spokeswoman said the two incidents appear to be unrelated. Comments are closed for this article.
Some 95 jobs to go at Mater Private Healthcare Some 95 jobs to go at Mater Private Healthcare Moves to reduce size of workforce come as part of overall cost-cutting programme Mater Private Healthcare has said that while steps had been taken in recent years to reduce costs, this had fallen short of what was necessary. Photograph: Cyril Byrne/The Online News Mark Hilliard Mater Private Healthcare is to cut its workforce by about 10 per cent . The company said it would require approximately 95 redundancies from a staff of around 980. âMarket conditions for the private health sector have presented the Mater Private Healthcare Group with a number of challenges in recent years. There has been a significant reduction in the number of people with health insurance,â it said. Moves to reduce the size of its workforce comes as part of an overall cost-cutting programme at the company, which acknowledged that the recent announcement regarding a reduction in tax relief for those with private health insurance âmay cause further erosionâ within the sector. The company said that while steps had been taken in recent years to reduce costs this had fallen short of what was necessary. âMater Private has no choice but to reduce headcount by around 95, which it will seek to do by way of a voluntary redundancy programme,â it said. âMater Private has concluded that this step is unavoidable in order to safeguard as many jobs as possible for the future, while maintaining a high level of patient care.â Return to results
Sony PSP console hits US in March Sony PSP console hits US in March US gamers will be able to buy Sony's PlayStation Portable from 24 March, but there is no news of a Europe debut. The handheld console will go on sale for $250 (Â£132) and the first million sold will come with Spider-Man 2 on UMD, the disc format for the machine. Sony has billed the machine as the Walkman of the 21st Century and has sold more than 800,000 units in Japan. The console (12cm by 7.4cm) will play games, movies and music and also offers support for wireless gaming. Sony is entering a market which has been dominated by Nintendo for many years. It launched its DS handheld in Japan and the US last year and has sold 2.8 million units. Sony has said it wanted to launch the PSP in Europe at roughly the same time as the US, but gamers will now fear that the launch has been put back. Nintendo has said it will release the DS in Europe from 11 March. "It has gaming at its core, but it's not a gaming device. It's an entertainment device," said Kaz Hirai, president of Sony Computer Entertainment America. Comments are closed for this article.
Sony PSP tipped as a 'must-have' Sony PSP tipped as a 'must-have' Sony's Playstation Portable is the top gadget for 2005, according to a round-up of ultimate gizmos compiled by Stuff Magazine. It beats the iPod into second place in the Top Ten Essentials list which predicts what gadget-lovers are likely to covet this year. Owning all 10 gadgets will set the gadget lover back Â£7,455. That is Â£1,000 cheaper than last year's list due to falling manufacturing costs making gadgets more affordable. Portable gadgets dominate the list, including Sharp's 902 3G mobile phone, the Pentax Optio SV digital camera and Samsung's Yepp YH-999 video jukebox. "What this year's Essentials shows is that gadgets are now cheaper, sexier and more indispensable than ever. We've got to the point where we can't live our lives without certain technology," said Adam Vaughan, editor of Stuff Essentials. The proliferation of gadgets in our homes is inexorably altering the role of the high street in our lives thinks Mr Vaughan. "Take digital cameras, who would now pay to develop an entire film of photos? Or legitimate downloads, who would travel miles to a record shop when they could download the song in minutes for 70p?" he asks. Next year will see a new set of technologies capturing the imaginations of gadget lovers, Stuff predicts. The Xbox 2, high-definition TV and MP3 mobiles will be among the list of must-haves that will dominate 2006, it says. The spring launch of the PSP in the UK is eagerly awaited by gaming fans.

Sporting rivals go to extra time Sporting rivals go to extra time The current slew of sports games offers unparalleled opportunities for fans who like to emulate on-field action without ever moving from the couch. The two giants in the field - ESPN and EA Sports - have been locked in a heavyweight battle for years. The latter is the world's largest games manufacturer. Years of experience mean that the titles in their steady flow of sport sims are finely honed, massively entertaining and ooze flair. Sports broadcaster ESPN, meanwhile, has leant its name to a series of games that are similarly classy but lower in profile and price. But that status quo was changed forever - or for the next 15 years at least - by a deal earlier this year when ESPN sold EA the rights to its TV branding and on-air talent, meaning the ESPN games presently developed by Sega will have to come to and end in their present form. It was a massive-money deal that not only raised eyebrows but stirred active indignation in many quarters, with fans concerned that it is set to enable EA to monopolise the sports gaming landscape to an unhealthy degree. Some particularly disgruntled fans set up an online petition that notched more than 18,000 virtual signatures. Many of those clicking to complain were already rankled, for the ESPN coup happened just weeks after EA had pulled off another enormous licensing deal, controversially giving them exclusive rights to teams and personnel from America&#191;s National Football League (NFL). So, will the Sega - ESPN range be missed? A key reason for answering "yes" is that liking or disliking a sports game regularly comes down to personal taste, and having some options available always proves hugely handy. Online soccer fans will testify to that, between bouts of arguing over which high-profile title rules supreme out of the similar-yet-hugely-different FIFA 2005 and Pro Evolution Soccer 4. On the same note, the ESPN 2k5 and EA sports games have so little to choose between them that picking favourites will come down to players' personal preferences and spending budget rather than any technical elements. Taking hockey and basketball as examples, both publishers' efforts are phenomenally entertaining and fairly accessible. They also both look awesome, with the Sega / ESPN versions perhaps shading things on a graphical front. In terms of gameplay, I marginally preferred EA's NBA Live 2005 for basketball, and was more satisfied ice hockey-wise by ESPN's NHL 2K5. The ESPN games are a touch more arcade-like in look and feel and are slightly easier to get into, although like their rivals, they also offer a dizzyingly-extensive array of in-game tricks and overall challenge modes that should be enough to quench thirsts of even the most die-hard of sports fans. Perhaps the most interesting aspect of the ESPN deal will be seeing how it affects the presentation of EA's future titles. The front-end decoration of EA's games has become something of an art-form in itself, loaded with slick visuals and oodles of licensed music. They are also immediately identifiable as coming from the EA stable, and the inevitable compulsion to add an ESPN look will no doubt change that in various ways. What is a shame is that the ESPN titles took similar care about framing the gameplay with an authentic setting - their preambles look and sound much like they would on TV. They are neat and excellent-value games in their current form, and combining them with EA's own established brand should produce a truly formidable beast.
Stam spices up Man Utd encounter Stam spices up Man Utd encounter AC Milan defender Jaap Stam says Manchester United "know they made a mistake" by selling him in 2001. The sides meet at Old Trafford in the Champions League game on Wednesday and the 32-year-old's Dutchman's presence is sure to add spice to the fixture. "United made a mistake in selling me," Stam told Uefa's Champions magazine. "I was settled at Manchester United, but they wanted to sell me. If a club want to sell you, there is nothing you can do. You can be sold like cattle." Sir Alex Ferguson surprised the football world - and Stam - by selling the Dutchman to Lazio for Â£16.5m in August 2001. The decision came shortly after Stam claimed in his autobiography that Ferguson had tapped him up when he was at PSV Eindhoven. But Ferguson insisted he sold the defender because the transfer fee was too good to refuse for a player past his prime. The affair still rankles with the Dutchman. "I was settled at Manchester United, I had even just ordered a new kitchen, but they wanted to sell me," he said. "In what other industry can a good employee be ushered out the door against their wishes? "Of course, you can refuse to go, but then the club have the power to put you on the bench. I don't agree that players control the game. "There have been opportunities to confront them in the newspapers, but I have turned them down. What's the point?" Wednesday's game at Old Trafford will provide an intriguing confrontation between United's young attackers Wayne Rooney and Cristiano Ronaldo and Milan's veteran defence of Stam, Paolo Maldini, Cafu and Alessandro Costacurta. Stam says Rooney's teenage stardom is in stark contract to his own start in the game. "We can't all be Wayne Rooneys - at his age I was training to be an electrician and thought my chance of becoming a professional footballer had gone," he said. "Starting late can be a good thing. Some kids who start early get bored. "I had my youth - having fun, drinking beers, blowing up milk cannisters. It sounds strange but it's a tradition where I grew up in Kampen - and I had done all the things I wanted to do." Return to results
Students body withdraws from DrinkAware initiative Students body withdraws from DrinkAware initiative USI says it is concerned over ties to alcohol industry and response to Arthurâs Day Celebrating Arthurâs Day in Dublin last year. Photograph: Cyril Byrne/The Online News Mark Hilliard The body representing Irish third-level students has withdrawn from the DrinkAware campaign, citing concerns over its ties to the alcohol industry and muted response to Arthurâs Day celebrations. DrinkAware.ie promotes âresponsible drinkingâ. It was set up in 2006 by the Moderate Enjoyment of Alcohol group, an industry-funded body. In a recent letter to Meas chief executive Fionnuala Sheehan , the Union of Students Ireland (USI) said it was no longer co-operating with the initiative following a vote of its national council earlier this month. âIt is felt that we are best placed to develop a student alcohol awareness campaign independently through working with other bodies that are not funded by a self-regulating drinks industry,â wrote USI president Joe OâConnor and deputy Denise McCarthy. âIt may be important to note for your own internal purposes that the continued promotion of the Arthurâs Day festival by Diageo further deepened our concerns regarding the credibility of your alcohol awareness campaign.â Ms Sheehan said DrinkAware was a âsocial responsibility organisationâ, not a prohibition body. It had never hidden the fact it was funded by the industry and remained independent of it. She pointed to a Millward Brown survey for DrinkAware.ie in which 81 per cent said it was effective âwithout pointing the fingerâ. âThis would seem to suggest that separate from any opinion that some USI officers may currently hold, very many individual students see the value of the work being undertaken,â Ms Sheehan said.

Talks over doctor hours hit snag on sanctions Talks over doctor hours hit snag on sanctions IMO warns industrial action is just suspended and not off the table Junior doctors on picket duty outside the Mater Hospital. Photograph: The Online News Talks which started yesterday between non-consultant hospital doctors and health service management aimed at averting further industrial action over working hours are due to resume today at the Labour Relations Commission . The commission had invited the parties to attend further negotiations following a national stoppage by about 3,000 non-consultant hospital doctors on Tuesday as part of their campaign for an end to excessive working hours. The main sticking point between the doctors, who are represented by the Irish Medical Organisation (IMO), and the HSE centres around the sanctions to be applied in the event of hospitals breaching new rules to come into effect next year governing working hours for non-consultant hospital doctors. Arriving for talks at the LRC, the head of the IMO industrial relations, Steve Tweed , said the unionâs campaign of industrial action had only been suspended and had not been taken off the table. He said the IMO was at the talks to listen to proposals put forward by health service management on the sanctions that should apply in cases where new working-time rules were breached in the future. Mr Tweed said the organisationâs non-consultant hospital doctor committee would meet to consider whatever emerged from the talks. He said the HSE had written to the organisation on Tuesday and accepted that there would have to be provision for financial sanctions where breaches of the rules occurred. He said the IMO wanted to hear what the HSE had to say on the issue at the talks. The HSEâs head of human resources, Barry OâBrien, said he was hopeful a solution could be found that would bring stability and certainty to the health service and remove the risk of further industrial action. Financial sanctions However, he again ruled out any financial sanctions for breaching working time rules that involved the payment of additional money to doctors. He said this was precluded by existing agreements, including the Haddington Road deal. The talks adjourned last night, with an IMO spokesman saying both sides would reflect overnight on the issues before resuming negotiations today. About 7,400 patients were affected by the strike on Tuesday. These patients either had elective (non-urgent) procedures deferred or appointments at outpatient clinics postponed. Minister for Health James Reilly said on Tuesday it was hoped to reschedule these appointments as quickly as possible. He suggested that senior managers in hospitals which breached new rules on working hours for non-consultant doctors could âbe relieved of their dutiesâ in the future. Return to results
The OECD has criticised Government policies on job creation. The OECD has criticised Government policies on job creation. Photograph: Frank Miller /The Online News Dan O'Brien, Dan Keenan Ireland is back on its feet and on verge of becoming first EU country to exit its bailout, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has said. But Dr Angel Gurria, secretary general of the OECD, warned that growth, which has proven frustratingly slow to date, would not pick up unless competitiveness improved and the banksâ balance sheets were cleaned up. âIndicators all point to recovery taking place now, gives us all confidence that economy is on the mend,â he said. Declining public sector debt will help underscore faith in a ârobust recovery,â he added with the achievable prospect of nearly 2 per cent growth next year. He insisted the OECD âdoes not tell the Irish what to do with Irelandâ, instead it helps make available advice on best international practice. The OECDâs biannual report, published today, contains a series of strong criticisms of the Governmentâs reform efforts.The Paris-based think tank bluntly states that ânow is the time to implement policies that will promote sustainable growth and job creationâ. Some of the starkest criticisms relate to jobs policies. The report says that âpolicies still do not focus enough on long-term unemploymentâ and urged the Government to âprioritise the engagement with long-term jobseekers and increase the number of [Department of Social Protection] caseworkers supporting them, through internal redeploymentâ. Repeating calls made by the organisation in its last country report almost two years ago, it called for a review of tax and welfare structures to raise labour force participation of low-wage workers. It also calls for the content of education and training schemes to be better aligned âso that they provide skills required in the expanding sectorsâ. Addressing specifically long-term and youth unemployment, Mr Gurria said rates were unacceptably high. He suggested there should not be a return to a heavy reliance on the contruction industry and said Ireland should move more âfrom bricks to brainsâ. The OECD says that resources should be target on policies âempirically-provenâ to improve employability, but that doing so will require greater evaluation of labour-market programmes. Such evaluations should form the basis âto close down ineffective schemes, while strengthening successful onesâ. Echoing the need to shut down failed training schemes, the report also says that the State should âwind downâ policy measures that are failing to boost innovation in the private sector, adding that âsignificant uncertainties (exist) ]about the effectiveness of various innovation policy tools. It calls on the Government to independently and regularly evaluate all actions in the innovation area, so that programmes with proven higher returns can receive most resources, including funds from wound down schemes. To counter inertia in the system, the report recommends that âall innovation and enterprise supports have sunset clausesâ. To increase the effectiveness and cost-efficiency of the innovation and research policies and make it easier for businesses to access support, the report recommends that the Stateâs manifold innovation funding schemes and wider policy supports by consolidation into a smaller number of Government agencies. âGovernment support for innovation has grown too complicated for firms to access it easily or for efficient evaluation,â it says. The organisation advocates centralised legal processes for intellectual property rights transfers and a new central technology transfer office, in a bid to increase capital supply and encourage entrepreneurship. It also calls for increased competition in legal services, a reduction in licensing costs and waiting times and changes to the examinership process. Many of the recommendations made in the report have been made in previous studies, including the last one in October 2011. .

The effect of a second diagnosis can be like a bereavement The effect of a second diagnosis can be like a bereavement Rhona Nally: âthe focus was on getting through treatment and getting on with your life. I left very alone and upset after these meetings.â Photograph: Jane Curtin. Just weeks after completing a year of tough and invasive treatment for primary breast cancer, Rhona Nally received the distressing news which every person with the disease fears â the cancer had spread to her bones in multiple sites. âIt was like a bereavement,â she recalls today, happily a full nine years after that devastating diagnosis, âYou lose your health, your work, your hopes, everything people take for granted.â The narrative of most cancer treatment these days is an encouraging one â new drugs, improved results, longer survival, better services. But for Nally and an estimated 3,000 women in Ireland who have advanced breast cancer, the situation is altogether less sanguine. Their world is marked by isolation from the mainstream breast cancer community, which is more geared to women with a diagnosis of primary breast cancer and the greater chances of a successful treatment that this involves. âThe initial diagnosis of cancer comes as a great shock, but youâre put on a very well-defined path,â says Nally, a 58-year-old mother of three from Knocklyon in south Dublin. âYou get support, a breast cancer nurse, access to multidisciplinary teams. You know what treatment youâll have and when. Itâs not something you want to happen but there is, hopefully, light at the end of the tunnel.â With a secondary diagnosis, she says âthereâs none of that. There is no defined path. You play it by ear. Treatments are tried, but they may or may not work. And, generally, itâs terminal.â Treatment for primary cancer is invariably aggressive, as doctors try to root out the cause of the disease for good. With advanced cases, itâs more about palliative care and quality of life. Advanced breast cancer includes metastatic breast cancer (stage IV) which is the most serious form of the disease and occurs when the cancer has spread to other parts of the body such as the bones, liver or lungs. âBreast cancer communityâ It also includes locally advanced breast cancer (stage III) when the cancer has spread to the lymph nodes or other tissue in the area of the breast but not to the distant sites in the body. It is estimated that about 700 women present with advanced breast cancer every year. Ãine Melinn, a psychologist and Irish Cancer Society facilitator, describes how women, when first diagnosed with breast cancer, are âinstantly part of a vibrant breast cancer community. But when their cancer spreads or if they are first diagnosed with advanced breast cancer, it is no longer about becoming a survivor, itâs about surviving.â Nally recalls her upset on receiving a diagnosis of secondary cancer and the lack of supports that existed in 2004. She gave up her teaching job and tried to arm herself with knowledge. Return to results
UK house prices rise again UK house prices rise again Index jumps to highest in more than a decade as supply lags demand With the supply of property coming to the market continuing to lag so far behind demand, itâs expected that the imbalance will result in further upward pressure in prices. A UK house-price index rose to the highest in more than a decade last month, as government measures to boost homebuying lifted the outlook for sales to a record. A gauge by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) increased to 54, the highest since June 2002, from 41 in August, the London-based group said this morning, citing a poll of property surveyors. A price-expectations measure advanced to 48, the highest since May 2002. The latest evidence of a strengthening property market comes as the government begins the second phase of its Help to Buy program. While the measure, aimed at helping potential buyers get on the property ladder, has prompted warnings that it could fuel a bubble, the Bank of England has said housing activity remains low by historic standards. âItâs encouraging that the market is starting to improve in all parts of the country,â said Peter Bolton King, RICS global residential director. âItâs a big concern that the supply of property coming to the market is lagging so far behind demand. This imbalance is likely to result in further upward pressure in prices.â While the index of new buyer enquiries -- a proxy for demand -- fell to 49 in September from 65 in August, that compares with a reading of 10 for new seller instructions, todayâs report showed. A gauge of sales expectations surged to 56 from 41, the highest since that index began in 1998. âThe pressure on prices is evident,â RICS said. âGrowth in demand has now outstripped growth in new instructions in every month since February.â RICS said survey respondents reported price increases in all regions in September, apart from the North, and expectations indicators are positive in all areas. London and the southeast led gains last month, it said. Respondents expect U.K. home values to gain 2.6 percent in the next 12 months and an average 4.9 percent over the coming five years. London prices are seen rising an average of 9 percent a year in that period. RICS said the improving economy may be helping to release some âpent-up demand.â U.K. growth accelerated in the second quarter, and industry surveys indicate expansion may have strengthened in the three months through September. Data from mortgage lender Halifax showed that house values increased for an eighth straight month in September. âStimulus such as the Bank of Englandâs Funding for Lending scheme and the governmentâs Help to Buy initiative have also had important roles,â RICS said. âAnecdotal evidence from responses to this survey suggests the latter policy, in particular, is now having an effect.â Online News
UK housing market picks up speed, business lending down UK housing market picks up speed, business lending down House prices in November rose at their fastest pace in three years Britainâs housing market recovery is advancing but data today also showed how businesses are struggling to get credit, highlighting why the Bank of England has shifted a stimulus programme away from the housing market. House prices in November rose at their fastest pace in three years and mortgage approvals hit a nearly six-year high last month. By contrast, lending to businesses contracted by more than 3 per cent in the three months to the end of October, Bank of England data showed. âThe numbers suggest that, despite the medium-term risk of a housing bubble, banks are much more willing to take a punt on the housing market than on small and medium-sized enterprises,â said Carl Astorri, an economist with the EY Item Club, an economic forecaster. âThe change in policy direction should help to get the UK growth engine firing on all cylinders, as well as decrease the risk of a housing bubble developing over the medium term.â Yesterday, the BoE unexpectedly said it was ending incentives for banks to provide mortgages as part of its Funding for Lending scheme and would focus the scheme exclusively on lending to businesses. BoE Governor Mark Carney played down any immediate risks from rising housing prices, which have been much stronger in London and the south east of England than elsewhere, but said it was time to take the foot off the accelerator when it came to encouraging banks to offer mortgages. Fridayâs data showed mortgage approvals for house purchases rose to 67,701 in October from 66,891 in September. That was its highest level since February 2008, though below a pre-crisis average of around 90,000. Economists in a Online News poll had expected a bigger increase to 68,500 approvals during October. While the BoE and the government are refocusing the FLS scheme away from housing, another government programme to encourage mortgage lending is just getting under way - last month saw the launch of state guarantees for low-deposit mortgages under Help to Buy programme. Prime Minister David Cameron said on November 11th that 2,000 homebuyers had obtained mortgages through Help to Buy schemes since the second phase was launched. Critics say the plan wonât help spur new building much and will only push up prices. House prices rose 6.5 per cent in the 12 months to November, according to a survey by mortgage lender Nationwide. That was the biggest increase since July 2010 and larger than economists had expected, though they are still around 6 per cent below their peak in late 2007. With the economy growing at an annualised rate of more than 3 per cent, property prices look set to rise further. By contrast, business lending has not taken off as the BoE and the government hoped when they launched FLS last year. Todayâs data from the Bank showed net business lending fell by Â£1.1 billion in October and lending to small and medium-sized firms fell by Â£505 million. Manufacturers have called on finance minister George Osborne to do more to help businesses invest when he announces his half-yearly budget statement next week. Consumer credit grew at an annualised rate of 6.0 per cent in the three months to October, slowing from a month earlier. The Â£500 million increase in October alone was lower than the Â£650 million that economists had expected and was down sharply from Â£1.1 billion in September. Some economists said British households may have been holding back on spending ahead of the Christmas holidays. A separate gauge of consumer sentiment fell for a second month in November, the first back-to-back decline since the summer of 2011. The poll, by market research firm GfK, was conducted in early November, when steep rises in gas and electricity tariffs made headline news. (Online News) Return to results
UK study shows greatest benefits for people aged under 30 UK study shows greatest benefits for people aged under 30 A 20 per cent tax on sugary drinks in the UK would cut the nationâs obesity rate by 1.3 per cent. Photograph: PA Wire A 20 per cent tax on sugary drinks in the UK would cut the nationâs obesity rate by 1.3 per cent, with the greatest benefit for people under 30, a study found. The tax, proposed by the UKâs Academy of Medical Royal Colleges, would result in about 180,000 fewer adults with a body mass index of 30 or more, researchers from the universities of Oxford and Reading wrote in the journal BMJ. Among people ages 16 to 30, who are the greatest consumers of sugary drinks, the tax would reduce obesity by 7.6 per cent, the study showed. About 26 per cent of adults in the UK are obese, the second-highest rate in Europe behind Hungary , which has adopted taxes on salt and sugar. While other European nations and some US states tax soft drinks, most levies are less than 10 per cent. The findings show that while a tax wouldnât be a panacea, it could help reduce the diabetes, heart disease and tooth decay linked with the drinks, the authors wrote. âThe more pressing question is whether policy makers can implement a tax this high,â Jason Block , an assistant professor at the Harvard Medical Schoolâs obesity prevention program in Boston , wrote in comments accompanying the study. âWe now need policy makers to act and provide opportunities for real-world evidence.â The study used data from household spending and diet surveys, together with systems for estimating the effect of tax increases on drink purchases, and changes in energy intake on body mass index. Body mass index is a measure of body fat, calculated by using a personâs weight and height. Based on their findings, the researchers predicted that the tax would reduce the number of overweight people, defined as those with a BMI of 25 or more, by 285,000, or 0.9 per cent. It would also raise 276 million pounds (â¬325m) a year in revenue and reduce consumption of concentrated sugar- sweetened drinks by 15 per cent, according to the study. The Academy of Medical Royal Colleges, which represents about 220,000 British doctors, in February proposed testing the tax for a year as one of 10 recommendations for curbing obesity. The UK governmentâs health department said companies including Tesco Plc and Coca-Cola Co. have agreed to reduce sugar in their drinks under a voluntary plan aimed at improving public health. âThe voluntary action we have put in place will help people to make healthier choices but we keep all international evidence under review,â the department said in an e-mailed statement. Taxing soft drinks wonât curb obesity, partly because its causes are complex, Gavin Partington , director general of the British Soft Drinks Association , said in an e-mailed statement. âTrying to blame one set of products is misguided, particularly when they comprise a mere 2 per cent of calories in the average diet,â he said.

US productivity rises modestly, wage inflation subdued US productivity rises modestly, wage inflation subdued Data may allow Federal Reserve to maintain its monetary stimulus to the economy for a while US labour costs were up 1.9 per cent from a year ago, new data showed. Photograph: Daniel Acker/Online News US nonfarm productivity rose less than expected in the third quarter and a drop in unit labor costs pointed to subdued wage inflation that should allow the Federal Reserve to maintain its massive monetary stimulus to the economy for a while. Productivity rose at a 1.9 per cent annual rate after increasing at a 1.8 per cent pace in the second quarter, the Labor Department said today. Productivity, which measures hourly output per worker, was unchanged compared to the same period last year. Economists polled by Online News had forecast productivity rising at a 2.2 per cent rate in the July-September quarter. Unit labor costs - a gauge of the labour-related cost for any given unit of output - fell at 0.6 per cent rate in the third quarter, underscoring the lack of wage-related inflation pressures in the economy. Unit labour costs had risen at a 0.5 per cent pace in the second quarter. Economists polled by Online News had expected unit labour cost to rise at a 0.2 per cent pace in the third quarter. Labour costs were up 1.9 per cent from a year ago. (Online News) Comments are closed for this article.
US senators call Irish tax loophole pledge âencouragingâ US senators call Irish tax loophole pledge âencouragingâ Levin and McCain hope Ireland ready to close door on âegregious corporate tax abusesâ US Senator Carl Levin talks to reporters as he climbs an escalator at the US Capitol in Washington, DC. Mr Levin labelled Ireland a âtax havenâ during the hearing of the Senate permanent subcommittee on investigations, of which the Michigan senator is chairman. Photograph: Mark Wilson/Getty Images Two US senators who have sharply criticised Irelandâs loose tax laws for allowing American multinationals to avoid taxes have described the Governmentâs promise to close a loophole as âencouraging.â Democrat Carl Levin and Republican John McCain said they hoped yesterdayâs pledge by Minister for Finance Michael Noonan to tackle the use of âstatelessâ Irish companies by US multinationals to lower their taxes would show that Ireland is âready to close the door on these egregious corporate tax abuses.â The Government plans to introduce a change that will force Irish companies to declare tax residency in a different jurisdiction or else be held liable for the Irish corporate tax rate of 12.5 per cent in 2015. It is in Irelandâs interests to stop blocking a tax on financial transactions Apple was criticised by the two senators at a Congressional hearing in May for using Irish companies, which were not tax resident anywhere, to pay less than 2 per cent tax on $44 billion of non-US income over four years. âIrelandâs promise to reform its tax rules to stop multinationals from using Irish subsidiaries to escape or defer paying taxes anywhere in the world is encouraging,â the senators said in a joint statement released last night in response to Mr Noonanâs comments. âImportant questions do remain, however, including whether the new rules will continue to allow Irish subsidiaries to dodge taxes by, for example, excluding substantial income from the 12 per cent Irish tax rate, calculating taxable income in ways that produce a lower effective tax rate, or simply declaring tax residency with no corporate tax. âHopefully, the answers will demonstrate that Ireland is ready to close the door on these egregious corporate tax abuses enabling multinational tax avoidance.â Mr Levin labelled Ireland a âtax havenâ during the hearing of the Senate permanent subcommittee on investigations, of which the Michigan senator is chairman. The Government has drawn fire from tax campaigners over companies such as Apple, Facebook and Google using Irish companies to exploit international tax loopholes to avoid multi-billion dollar tax bills. The Ministerâs announcement marks the first move to crack down on tax avoidance by multinationals, yielding to pressure to rein in sharp global tax practices followed by major corporations. âLet me be crystal clear, Ireland wants to be part of the solution to this global tax challenge, not part of the problem,â said the Minister in his budget speech. Mr Noonan said that countries are competing more and more aggressively for âmobile foreign direct investmentâ and he wanted to ensure Irelandâs corporate tax regime remains competitive. âI want Ireland to play fair â as we have always done â and I want Ireland to play to win,â he said. The American Chamber of Commerce Ireland said the changes announced in the budget relating to tax residency rules should not adversely affect the existing operation of multinational companies in Ireland, or the countryâs competitiveness as a location for foreign direct investment. The chamberâs chairwoman Anna Scally said the release of a document outlining Irelandâs international tax strategy as part of the budget would provide certainty, and would be âwelcomed by potential and current investorsâ. âThis strategy reconfirms Irelandâs long term commitment to attracting foreign direct investment to create jobs and economic activity. Irelandâs corporate tax regime is open and transparent and the Irish Government has reaffirmed its commitment to maintaining a competitive corporate tax regime,â she said. .

Value of Irish exports increases 4% in August Value of Irish exports increases 4% in August EU takes 56% of goods from Ireland, while the US takes 21% Goods going to the European Union accounted for 56 per cent of total exports from Ireland in August. Photograph: Spencer Platt/Getty Images The Irish export sector appears to be recovering slowly, as figures released by the Central Statistics Office show a rise in the level of exports in August after a poor performance earlier in the year. The value of Irish exports on a seasonally adjusted basis was â¬7.64 billion, 4 per cent higher than July and 7 per cent higher than average monthly exports in the first seven months of the year. When compared with last August however, the value of exports fell by 17 per cent to â¬6.96 billion in the month, due to exceptionally high exports in August 2012. Exports of organic chemicals fell â¬579 million on a year-on-year basis, while medical and pharmaceutical exports were down â¬422 million, largely due to a number of Irish-manufactured drugs coming off patent this year. Exports to the European Union accounted for 56 per cent of the total in August. The US was the main destination outside the EU, taking 21 per cent of exports. The value of imports increased by 1 per cent, or â¬39 million, to â¬3.9 billion comparing August to the same month in 2012. Imports of petrol and related products accounted for the most significant increase, rising 32 per cent in the period. Some 64 per cent of goods imported into Ireland in the month came from within the EU, with 31 per cent coming from the UK. The US was the main source of non-EU imports, accounting for 11 per cent of the total, followed by China at 8 per cent. âThe export sector has been the main driver of Irish economic activity in recent times and will remain the key growth engine for some period to come,â Merrion Stockbrokers economist Alan McQuaid said in a note. âWeak global demand has hit Irish exports in the past couple of years, particularly on the merchandise goods side. But there are signs now that the world economy, including the key markets of the United States , Eurozone and UK, is starting to recover, which augurs well for Irish exports in the coming months. This should to some degree help offset the negative drag from the patents issue.â Merrion Stockbrokers is forecasting a flat performance for exports in 2013, even allowing for a pick up in activity in the latter part of the year. .

Video phone help for deaf people Video phone help for deaf people Deaf people who prefer to communicate using British Sign Language (BSL) could soon be having their phone conversations relayed using webcams or videophones and an interpreter. The Video Relay Service is being piloted by the Royal National Institute for Deaf People (RNID), but the organisation says unless the service is provided at the same rate as voice calls it will be beyond most people's pockets. The RNID is urging telecoms regulator, Ofcom, to reduce the cost of the service from the current Â£7.00 per minute and make it the same as ordinary phone calls. The service works by putting a deaf person in visual contact with a BSL interpreter via a webcam or video phone, and the interpreter then relays the deaf person's conversation using a telephone and translates the other person's response into sign language. For many deaf people, especially those born deaf, BSL is a first and preferred means of communication. Until now, the only alternative has been to use textphones which means having to type a message and have it relayed via an operator. "In the past, I've used textphones but they have problems," said Robert Currington who is taking part in the pilot. "I communicate in BSL; my written English is not very good and it takes me longer to think in English and type my message." "I sometimes find it difficult to understand the reply." The RNID says the UK is lagging behind other countries which are already making relay services available at the cost of an ordinary phone call. "There are no technical or economic reasons for not providing equivalent access to services for deaf people," said RNID technology director, Guido Gybels. "In the US and Australia, sign language relay services have already been made universally available at the same cost as a voice call. "By failing to provide and fund the video relay service for sign language users, the telecommunications sector is effectively discriminating against an already disenfranchised group." Ofcom says it has plans to review the services that telecoms companies are obliged to provide early next year. And new technology, including the Video Relay Service, will be discussed with interested parties in the near future. But a spokesman said its powers were limited by legislation. "Any proposals to extend existing arrangements to cover new services would be for government to consider," he said. Mr Currington, like many of the UK's 70,000 BSL users, will be hoping that a way can be found to make a cost-effective service available. "The relay service makes phone conversations a pleasure," he said. "I can show my emotions more easily in BSL in the same way hearing people express emotions through voice calls."

Youth unemployment fell for the first time since April Youth unemployment fell for the first time since April A queue for unemployment benefit outside Bishop Street social welfare office in Dublin. Photo: Frank Miller/The Online News The euro zone unemployment rate was flat in August after easing in July for the first time in two years, showing the nascent economic recovery was starting to have a positive impact on the labour market. The economy of the 17 countries using the euro returned to growth in the second quarter following 18 months of contraction, which marked the longest recession since creation of the single currency in 1999. The euro zone unemployment rate in August was 12.0 per cent of the labour force for a second month in a row, just below the record 12.1 per cent in June and May, the European Unionâs statistics office Eurostat said on Tuesday. The July rate was revised to 12.0 percent from the previously reported 12.1 percent. âThe overall euro zone unemployment rate remains worryingly high, and the chances seem slim that it will come down appreciably anytime soon,â said Howard Archer, an economist at IHS Global Insight. âEurozone economic activity is likely to remain too limited in the near term at least to generate a significant number of jobs,â he added. But in absolute numbers, the number of people out of work still edged marginally lower to 19.178 million in August from 19.183 million in July. Economists expect improvement in the labour market to be slow because governments need to continue with austerity and structural reforms, while small and medium business - the bulk of European companies - still suffer from a credit squeeze. In a positive signal, youth unemployment, which is of particular importance for Europe as it carries long-term social and economic risks, fell for the first time since April to 23.7 per cent from 23.8 per cent in July. European leaders have made reducing unemployment one of their top priorities and agreed on special schemes designed to help job creation, easier access to credit for companies and further education and training for school leavers. Spain and Greece were the countries where unemployment was the highest, above 25 per cent, and economists do not expected it to fall below 20 per cent in the near term. Italy, in political turmoil threatening the survival of the shaky government led by prime minister Enrico Letta, saw its unemployment rate inch up to 12.2 per cent in August from 12.1 per cent in July. Unemployment in Europeâs largest economy Germany, waiting for a new government to be formed after elections in September, stood at 5.2 per cent, the second lowest in the euro zone after Austria which had 4.9 per cent.

A question of trust and technology A question of trust and technology A major government department is without e-mail for a week, and technology analyst Bill Thompson wants to know what happened. A couple of weeks ago I wrote about how my girlfriend had suffered when her cable modem blew up and she was offline for several days. It seems that thousands of civil servants at the UK's Department of Work and Pensions went through the same thing last week. It has emerged that the internal network crashed in a particularly horrible way, depriving staff of e-mail and access to the application software they use to calculate people's benefit and pension entitlement or note changes in personal circumstances. Senior consultants from EDS, the computer firm which manage the system, and Microsoft, which supplied the software, were running around trying to figure out what had to be done to fix it all, while staff resorted to phone, fax and probably carrier pigeon to get work done. Fortunately the back-office systems which actually pay people their money were still working, so only new claims and updates were affected done properly. This is bad enough for those affected, but it does mean that the impact is not devastating for millions of pensioners. I am sure regular readers will be expecting one of my usual diatribes against poor software, badly specified systems and inadequate disaster recovery plans. Although the full story has not yet been told, it seems that the problem started when a plan to upgrade some of the computers from Windows 2000 to Windows XP went wrong, and XP code was inadvertently copied to thousands of machines across the network. This is certainly unfortunate, but I have a lot of sympathy for the network managers and technology staff involved. Today's computer networks are large, complex and occasionally fragile. The interconnectedness that we all value also gives us a degree of instability and unpredictability that we cannot design out of the systems. It is the network equivalent of Godel's Theorem - any system sufficiently complex to be useful is also able to collapse catastrophically. So I will reserve judgment on the technology aspects until we all know what actually happened and whether it was a consequence of software failure or just bad luck. What is really disturbing, and cannot be excused, is the fact that it took four days for news of this systems failure to leak out into the technical press. It is, without a doubt, a major story and was the second or third lead item on Online News Radio 4's Today programme throughout Friday morning. So why did not the prime minister's official spokesman mention it at any lobby briefings before Friday? Why was not the pensions minister in Parliament to make an emergency statement on Tuesday, when it was clear that there was a serious problem? If there had been an outbreak of Legionnaire's disease in the air conditioning system we would have been told, but it seems that major technology problems do not merit the same treatment. While EDS and Microsoft will no doubt be looking for technical lessons to learn from their week of pain, we can learn some political lessons too. And the most important is that in this digital world, technology failures are matters of public interest, not something that can be ignored in the hope that nobody will notice, care or understand. That means we need a full report on what went wrong and what was done to fix it. It would be unacceptable for any of the parties involved to hide behind commercial confidentiality or even parliamentary privilege. A major system has evidently collapsed and we need to know what went wrong and what is being done differently. Anything less is a betrayal of public trust. Bill Thompson is a regular commentator on the Online News World Service programme Go Digital. Return to results
After Riverdance, one of the things Chinese people associate with Ireland is golf. With golf an esse... After Riverdance, one of the things Chinese people associate with Ireland is golf. With golf an essen- tial lifestyle option for the swelling ranks of wealthy Chinese, there is great market potential for Irish companies keen to bring the tycoons to Ireland to play. âTourism data from the Chinese Tourism Academy is showing an 18 per cent outbound increase for this year so far,â says Prof Jim Deegan , an economist at University of Limerick who is non-executive chairman of Riordanâs Travel. âIf Ireland can adapt to and accommodate the high spending Chinese tourist, then we could catch a reasonable proportion of what will be a growing and high spending source of tourists into the future.â Riordanâs has been nurturing the elite Chinese market to Ireland since 2011, with a heavy focus on golf, and has sponsored a number of events in China and hosted some very influential Chinese golfers in Ireland. âThe Chinese want links courses and high profile-best in class courses â like Royal County Down, Portmarnock, Lahinch, Ballybunion, K Club etc,â says Deegan. There are about 600 courses in China, which is not much when you consider there are 450 courses in Ireland, and many Chinese golfers are thinking of golf holidays. âPotentially, it is huge business. Golfers in China are businessmen, so getting them interested in Ireland is the first link to developing a very profitable sector of the tourism industry.â Golf has had a patchy career in China in recent years. There have been some spectacular successes, with the construction of major golf courses, the development of young players and the rising middle class and the way it has taken to the links. However, it has also suffered from the government calling a halt to the construction of new courses because of land grabs angering local farmers who are forced to watch helplessly as their arable land is turned into a sand trap. Then there is the Communist governmentâs suspicion of what is the ultimate bourgeois pastime. However, at the upper end of the market, golf is thriving. Last week, Riordanâs made a presentation about golf in Ireland at an end-of-year dinner for Beijingâs top five private clubs â the Beijing Hong Kong Jockey Club, Beijingâs Premier Business Club, the Chang An Club, the China Club Beijing and the Beijing American Club. âWe have golf and many of the products which high net-worth Chinese want but we are not really in that space yet,â Deegan says. âWe are working with COTRI â Chinese Outbound Tourist Research Institute â to develop this market and to teach and train Irish businesses on how to make the Irish tourism product more attractive to Chinese visitors.â There are signs that it is spreading beyond the elite, while golfâs inclusion as an Olympic sport from 2016 will do a lot to boost its profile in Olympics-mad China. Recently, the Shichahai state-run sports school, which is probably the best known of Chinaâs training centres for young athletes, has started training children to putt and drive. Getting in there early to promote the sport could well reap dividends further down the road. After all, the Chinese do claim to have invented the sport in 945 and to have even laid down the first rule set of rules in a 1282 book called Wan Jing or Manual of Ball Games.

Analysis: Motivation behind medical card campaign is clearly political Analysis: Motivation behind medical card campaign is clearly political Cash-strapped HSE is spending money to tell public it has misunderstood its position New cards are being issued, but older ones seemed to be disappearing at a similar rate. The information campaign on medical card eligibility announced by the HSE yesterday is unlikely to make much difference to those most directly affected. As Minister for Health James Reilly and his officials are fond of repeating, nothing has changed. The guidelines on income and the application of discretion are the same, along with the insistence that there is âno automatic entitlementâ to a card. What the public may notice is that their letter of refusal is written in plainer English. When they query a decision, they will be able to ring the helpline later in the evening. Staff will be better trained and more sensitive, but their message wonât change. The motivation behind the campaign is clearly political; for weeks now, hard-luck stories of people who were refused cards have dominated print columns and the airwaves, further sapping public support for the HSE and a beleaguered Minister. There is something odd about the HSE, which is starved of resources and preparing to cut hundreds of millions of euro off next yearâs budget, spending money to tell the public it has misunderstand the position in relation to medical cards. Where individual decisions have been reversed, it appears from yesterdayâs briefing by officials, this was generally because people failed to provide necessary information in their original application. Whatever the Minister and his officials say, the numbers seem to tell another story. Reilly insists there is no slowing down in the issuing of cards, yet the number of cards issued so far this year has increased by only 2,444, compared to more than 160,000 last year. New cards are being issued, but older ones seemed to be disappearing at a similar rate. The Minister and officials argue that there was a spike in approvals last year to clear a backlog of applications. There is some truth in this but it is hard to see how it explains the entire gap. A slew of GPs, along with consultants such as Orla Hardiman , have highlighted the difficulties experienced by their patients in obtaining a medical card. Are they wrong, misinformed or blinded by sympathy for their patients? The HSEâs response is to say again that there is no automatic entitlement to a card based on illness.

Apple sues 'Tiger' file sharers Apple sues 'Tiger' file sharers Apple has taken more legal action to stop online leaks of its new products. The computer giant has sued three men for releasing preview versions of its latest Mac OSX software onto file-sharing sites prior to its release. It said two versions of the operating system, codenamed Tiger, were put onto the net in October and December. It is the second time in two weeks Apple has taken legal action to protect its future products. Tiger is due to be shipped in early 2005. Last week, it filed a lawsuit against "unnamed individuals" who leaked details about new products onto the web. The latest action was against members of the Apple Developer Connection, a group of programmers which gets to see test versions of upcoming software so they can develop or change their own programs to work with them. "Members of Apple Developer Connection receive advance copies of Apple software under strict confidentiality agreements, which we take very seriously to protect our intellectual property," Apple said in a statement. It added that its future financial results were very much dependent on developing and improving its operating systems and other software. It is thought the men used sites which employ BitTorrent technology. With BitTorrent technology, sites do not host actual files being shared, instead they host a link that points people to others that have the particular file. Last week, the Motion Picture Association of America launched a legal campaign targeting websites that operate using the BitTorrent system in an effort to clamp down on movie piracy. Apple is no stranger to taking legal action against those who leak product information. In December 2002, it sued a former contractor who allegedly put drawings, images and engineering details of its PowerMac G4 computer online. The latest action was filed on Monday in the US District Court in California. It comes just weeks before the MacWorld conference in San Francisco, used to showcase new products. Return to results
Arnesen denies rift with Santini Arnesen denies rift with Santini Tottenham sporting director Frank Arnesen has denied that coach Jacques Santini resigned because of a clash of personalities at White Hart Lane. There had been newspaper speculation that Santini had felt undermined by Arnesen's role at the club. "It is absolutely not true," Arnesen told Online News Radio Five Live. "There is only one thing that made him resign and that is his own personal problems. "He has talked to me recently and said this matter is absolutely for himself." Arnesen said he was unable to throw any light onto the problems that caused Santini to quit after just 13 games in charge. He added: "Jacques has never gone into exactly what it was. But I trust him in that; you have to accept it. I think we should respect it. "The plan is now that over the weekend we will have talks with the board and then on Monday we will clarify the situation." Arnesen countered criticism at the timing of the announcement, coming less than 24 hours before Tottenham's Premiership fixture with Charlton. "When it comes down to personal problems, I don't think we should talk about timing," he said. And he also denied reports that Santini had been given a Â£3m pay-off. "That is absolute nonsense. He is the one who said 'I will go' and so he went'", said the Spurs sporting director. Tottenham's structure of having a sporting director working alongside a coach is based on a continental model and Arnesen sees no reason why they should change it. "I have confidence in this structure. I am confident that we have started something here in July and I still have a lot of confidence in Tottenham and what we are doing," he said. However, former Spurs and England defender Gary Stevens said he would not be surprised if the system had caused a rift. "I think the problems go a lot deeper, between the director of football at White Hart Lane and Santini," Stevens told Five Live. "On paper they could have worked together. But Frank Arnesen was a very creative, forward-thinking and expansive player - whereas I think Santini was very much the opposite, more a case of being organised, disciplined and happy not conceding goals. "That sort of arrangement can work if the two people have the same principles and ideals and work very closely. But it seems that has not happened." Return to results
Barcelona title hopes hit by loss Barcelona title hopes hit by loss Barcelona's pursuit of the Spanish title took a blow on Sunday as they fell to a 2-0 defeat at home to Atletico Madrid. Fernando Torres gave Athletico an ideal start with a goal in the first minute. Ronaldino wasted a second-half chance to equalise for Barca when he put a penalty wide, but Torres made no such mistake with a last-minute spot-kick. The defeat, coupled with Real Madrid's 4-0 win over Espanyol on Saturday, reduces Barca's lead to four points. Former Everton midfielder Thomas Gravesen scored his first goal for Real in the comfortable victory at the Bernabeu. Zinedine Zidane had opened the scoring before Raul bagged a brace. Gravesen, who replaced Zidane, completed the scoring in the 84th minute with a low shot. David Beckham, watched by Sven-Goran Eriksson, came off in the 67th minute with a shoulder injury but should be fit for England's game against Holland. England team-mate Michael Owen came on for Raul after 76 minutes with the game already won. Real have now won six consecutive Primera Liga games since coach Wanderley Luxemburgo took charge.

Blogs take on the mainstream Blogs take on the mainstream Web logs or blogs are everywhere, with at least an estimated five million on the web and that number is set to grow. These online diaries come in many shapes and styles, ranging from people willing to sharing their views, pictures and links, to companies interested in another way of reaching their customers. But this year the focus has been on blogs which cast a critical eye over news events, often writing about issues ignored by the big media or offering an eye-witness account of events. Most blogs may have only a small readership, but communication experts say they have provided an avenue for people to have a say in the world of politics. The most well-known examples include Iraqi Salam Pax's accounts of the US-led war, former Iranian vice-president Mohammad Ali Abtahi exclusive insight into the Islamic Republic's government, and the highs and lows of the recent US election campaign. There are already websites pulling together these first-hand reporting accounts heralded by blogs, like wikinews.com, launched last November. The blogging movement has been building up for many years. Andrew Nachison, Director of the Media Center, a US-based think-tank that studies media, technology and society, highlights the US presidential race as a possible turning point for blogs. "You could look at that as a moment when audiences exercised a new form of power, to choose among many more sources of information than they have never had before," he says. "And blogs were a key part of that transformation." Among them were blogs carrying picture messages, saying "we are sorry" for George W Bush's victory and the responses from his supporters. Mr Nachison argues blogs have become independent sources for images and ideas that circumvent traditional sources of news and information such as newspapers, TV and radio. "We have to acknowledge that in all of these cases, mainstream media actually plays a role in the discussion and the distribution of these ideas," he told the Online News News website. "But they followed the story, they didn't lead it." Some parts of the so-called traditional media have expressed concerns about this emerging competitor, raising questions about the journalistic value of blogs. Others, like the French newspaper Le Monde, have applied a different strategy, offering blogs as part of its content. "I don't think the mission and role of journalism is threatened. It is in transition, as society itself is in transition," says Mr Nachison. However, he agrees with other experts like the linguist and political analyst Noam Chomsky, that mainstream media has lost the traditional role of news gatekeeper. "The one-to-many road of traditional journalism, yes, it is threatened. And professional journalists need to acclimate themselves to an environment in which there are many more contributors to the discourse," says Mr Nachison. "The notion of a gatekeeper who filters and decides what's acceptable for public consumption and what isn't, that's gone forever." "With people now walking around with information devices in their pockets, like camera or video phones, we are going to see more instances of ordinary citizens breaking stories." It seems unlikely that we will end up living in a planet where every human is a blogger. But the current number of blogs is likely to keep on growing, in a web already overloaded with information. Blog analysis firm Technorati estimates the number of blogs in existence, the so-called blogosphere, has already exceeded five million, and is growing at exponential levels. Tools such as Google's Blogger, MovableType and the recently launched beta version of MSN Spaces are making it easier to run a blog. US research think-tank Pew Internet & American Life says a blog is created every 5.8 seconds, although less than 40% of the total are updated at least once every two months. But experts agree that the phenomenon, allowing individuals to publish, share ideas, exchange information, comment on current issues, post images or video on the web easily, is here to stay. "We are entering one era in which the technological infrastructure is creating a different context for how we tell our stories and how we communicate with each other," said Mr Nachison. "And there's going to be bad that comes with the good." Comments are closed for this article.
Brain drain warning over work conditions for consultants Brain drain warning over work conditions for consultants IHCA says top staff are emigrating over budget cuts and deteriorating conditions The Irish Hospital Consultantsâ Association says a deterioration in working conditions has forced some of the countryâs best consultants to leave the country and seek work overseas. Photograph: Patrick T Fallon/Online News Hospital consultants have warned of a medical brain drain created by deteriorating hospital working conditions and âunrelentingâ budget cuts. The Irish Hospital Consultantsâ Association says these trends have forced some of the countryâs best consultants to leave the country and seek work overseas. Doctors often go overseas when training to improve their skills, but the IHCA says it is virtually unprecedented for mid-career senior consultants with positions in Irish hospitals to emigrate again, as they are now. Consultants have suffered a succession of pay cuts in recent years while pay levels for those filling new consultant posts have been cut by 25 per cent. One in five consultancy posts in the public system are either vacant or filled on a temporary basis, the association pointed out. Speaking today at the associationâs annual conference in Maynooth, Co Kildare, president Denis Evoy said the continued degradation of consultantsâ working conditions and contracts was changing the medical landscape in Ireland and creating a system that cannot cater for its patients. âIrelandâs health service is being run with a focus on the implementation of declining annual budget rather than encouraging excellence across the system and making patients the priority.â Mr Evoy said as Ireland competed globally for medical staff it could not recruit and retain the most talented doctors and consultants. âThe brightest and best graduates, having finished prestigious fellowships, are accepting well-resourced and well-remunerated posts in America, Australia and New Zealand. âThe prolonged expectation of the HSE that consultants will endure declining working conditions, uncompetitive contracts and systems failures that result in compromised patient care cannot continue,â he added. âThe inability to appoint permanent consultants with appropriate contracts is impacting on patients directly through growing waiting lists, longer waiting times and cancellations of elective surgery.â The system was dealing with an additional 230,000 patients a year while budgets were about 25 per cent lower, he pointed out. Frontline staff could not continue delivering the services expected of them while maintaining âacceptableâ levels of patient care. .

Bundesbank raises growth forecast for German economy Bundesbank raises growth forecast for German economy Frankfurt-based central bank says economy is in good shape with low unemployment Jens Weidmann, president of the German Bundesbank and a member of the European Central Bank (ECB) governing council. Photograph: Brian Snyder/Online News The Bundesbank raised its growth forecasts for Europeâs largest economy as domestic spending benefits from low unemployment and a boost in earnings. The Frankfurt-based central bank lifted its projection for 2013 to âno more thanâ 0.5 per cent expansion from the 0.3 per cent predicted in June. It sees growth of 1.7 per cent in 2014, up from 1.5 per cent, and 2 per cent in 2015. âThe German economy is in good shape: the unemployment rate is low, employment is rising, and wage growth is returning to normal,â Bundesbank president Jens Weidmann said in a statement. âThese factors are supporting private consumption and driving housing construction,â he said, adding that âthere should, however, also be a pick-up in exports and, in their wake, an upturn in corporate investment and imports.â Germany has driven growth in the 17-nation euro region as countries from Italy to Greece struggle to emerge from recession. The European Central Bank held its benchmark interest rate at a record low of 0.25 per cent yesterday after a surprise cut in November. After economic expansion slowed to 0.3 percent in the three months through September, âgrowth in the German economy will be fairly strong in the final quarter of 2013 and the first quarter of 2014 provided that it is not slowed down temporarily by especially bad weather,â the Bundesbank said. âOver the medium term, the German economy should benefit not only from the rebound in global economic growth but also from the fact that the European economy is increasingly regaining its footing.â The ECB forecasts the 17-nation euro economy will contract 0.4 per cent this year, unchanged from its September forecast. It will expand 1.1 per cent in 2014 and 1.5 per cent in 2015. Previously, the ECB predicted 1 per cent growth next year. Inflation will average 1.1 per cent in 2014, 0.2 percentage point lower than projected in September, the ECB said. It sees inflation at 1.3 per cent in 2015, the first time it has made a forecast for that year. The Bundesbank kept its inflation forecast for this year unchanged at 1.6 percent. It cut its 2014 projection to 1.3 per cent from the 1.5 per cent predicted in June and sees annual price gains averaging 1.5 per cent in 2015. Online News Return to results
Business Opinion: a proposal to ease tax residency requirements may be financially tempting but is m... Business Opinion: a proposal to ease tax residency requirements may be financially tempting but is morally objectionable Fine Gael grandee Frank Flannery: tax equity arguments based on âideological bullshitâ. Photograph: Eric Luke One of the many straws blowing around in the pre-budget wind is the notion that Minister for Finance Michael Noonan might announce some sort of measure aimed at encouraging philanthropy by the very wealthy and the very offshore. The main proponent of this initiative is the Forum on Philanthropy, headed by Fine Gael grandee Frank Flannery . It has proposed that tax exiles be allowed spend an extra 43 days a year in Ireland in return for an up-front â¬5 million contribution and then â¬1 million a year thereafter for 10 years. At the moment they canât spend more than 280 days in Ireland over a two-year period without being caught in the tax net. The Department of Finance is not very keen on the idea and as long ago as last November the secretary general of the department, John Moran , put his concerns on record in a letter to the assistant secretary of the Department of the Taoiseach . The letter was released last week under the Freedom of Information Act to this paperâs Ronan McGreevy. Mr Moran â a former investment banker â argued it was unwise to do something that could be portrayed as allowing wealthy individuals to buy their way out of tax residency and also that the proposals would âinvolve a hollowing out of the residence rules for tax purposesâ. He concluded, in what is presumably formal civil servant speak: âHaving considered the proposal in detail, I believe the issues raised in this letter permit [sic] my department from supporting its introduction.â Moranâs objections seemed to have helped scotch any mention of the forumâs proposals in last yearâs budget. We are not privy to subsequent correspondence in relation to this yearâs budget but it is hard to see how Mr Moranâs position could have changed much. However, if Mr Flanneryâs comments in response to the release of the letter are anything to go by, the idea is far from dead. He said this weekend the idea had the support of Mr Noonan, whom he met earlier this month, but he did not know whether there would be anything in tomorrowâs budget or the subsequent Finance Bill. Morally objectionable Mr Flannery brushed aside Mr Moranâs concerns with a version of the âneeds mustâ argument popular among proponents of the morally objectionable but financially lucrative. To quote Mr Flannery: âThe alternative [to his proposal] is to close schemes in disadvantaged communities all over Ireland, putting charities out of business, all for what I would describe as ideological bullshit.â At a stroke he has turned the issue of tax equity â a core value of any functioning society â into a pragmatic issue concerning unnamed schemes in unnamed communities. It is as good an example as you could want of the of the sort of moral shading that lies behind pretty much every unethical decision that was ever made. Mr Flanneryâs other stroke of genius is to suggest that the big-time, US-style philanthropy he seeks to foster is ideology-free. In truth it is profoundly ideological. The notion that the rich are above national law and can do with their money as they see fit is the flip side of the out-of-control libertarian credo that currently threatens to force the richest country in the world to default on its debts. The nihilist elements of the US right are entirely comfortable with the notion that the wealthy get to pick and choose how they contribute to the society in which they make their money. The more extreme proponents of this viewpoint hold that threatening to wreck the global recovery in order to reverse measures aimed at redirecting some of their astronomical wealth towards healthcare for the poor upholds the principles of the US founding fathers. US-style philanthropy has a profoundly ideological aspect to it, and any honest debate about whether we want it in Ireland really has to acknowledge this. It would have consequences, one of which will be to remove a useful check on the influence of rich people that want to live here, make their money here, have a very big say in how the country is run but not have to pay the same taxes as everyone else. The implications of that are hard to predict but if you take a look across the Atlantic it is unlikely to be good news for those who believe in the European social democratic model. That, by the way, includes all of us who pay our taxes and will be asked to pay some more tomorrow. .

Call for local authorities to transfer empty properties to housing associations Call for local authorities to transfer empty properties to housing associations Focus Ireland conference hears 3,500 dwellings vacant but too expensive for councils to make habitable Jan OâSullivan, Minister of State for Housing and Planning, opens Focus Irelandâs conference on âNew Solutions to Finding Homesâ at the Aviva Stadium. Photograph: Dara Mac DÃ³naill/The Online News Local authorities should transfer over 3,500 vacant houses and flats to housing associations, a leading housing expert has said. Simon Brooks , director of policy with the ClÃºid housing association, said the associations would refurbish the homes and let them to households on waiting lists. He said many of these dwellings had fallen into such disrepair that the local authorities that owned them could not afford to make them habitable. This when there were almost 100,000 households on local authority waiting lists, was âa huge waste of resourcesâ. Mr Brooks was addressing a conference in the Aviva stadium in Dublin hosted by the homelessness charity Focus Ireland and opened by Jan Sullivan, Minister of State for Housing and Planning. âThe main reason these dwellings are lying vacant is that they require a lot of upgrading, some an awful lot. It is estimated the average cost of repairing them would be somewhere around â¬15,000 per dwelling, which most local authorities just donât have to spend on one house. âIf these were all repaired, refurbished and made habitable, and 3,500 people were taken out of private-rented properties where they are getting rent allowance, it could save the State â¬20 million a year.â Mr Brooks called on local authorities to identify vacant dwellings in need of significant upgrading and to inform interested housing associations. âThe housing associations would then raise the money to repair them, the local authority would transfer ownership to the housing associations, and households from its housing list would move into the dwellings. Objections âThere will be objections to a proposal like this. Some local authorities will see it as a transfer of their stock, a reduction in their stock. But the biggest transfer of local authority housing stock has already happened under tenant-purchase schemes. But the alternative at the moment is that these homes remain empty.â He said Dublin City Council was already working with ClÃºid on a âsmall number of propertiesâ. ClÃºid was repairing them with a view to taking them over to let to households on the councilâs waiting list. âWeâre hoping it can be seen as a pilot scheme that might be extended further if it was seen as an attractive option.â Comments are closed for this article.
Call for medical cards for very sick children Call for medical cards for very sick children Jack and Jill founder says dying children should get cards before healthy under-5s Taoiseach Enda Kenny is being called on to protect children who are palliative and going home to die by giving them a medical card automatically. Photograph: Eric Luke Medical cards should be given to terminally ill children ahead of the Governmentâs plan to expand eligibility to all under-5s, according to the head of the Jack and Jill Childrenâs Foundation. Chief executive Jonathan Irwin called on the Taoiseach to protect children who are palliative and going home to die by giving them a medical card automatically. Parents of healthy children under five years old do not want the free GP card at the expense of medical cards for children who are dying, he claimed. âMedical cards for a palliative (dying) child should not be up for review and should not be issued on a temporary basis, but rather given to the family automatically and followed up by a range of supports to help parents to care for their child at home.â Mr Irwin said the system was âthoughtless and coldâ because it forced parents of dying babies to queue up to register their childâs birth, before a childâs PPS number is issued and supports provided. âThis medical card debate is going around in circles post budget and I am calling on the Taoiseach to order a review of the HSEâs broken medical card system, before any Free GP cards for under 5s are initiated.â Meanwhile, the Irish Medical Organisation criticised claims that GPs were claiming fees for medical cards in respect of dead people. Dr Ray Walley , chairman of the GP Committee of the IMO, accused the Department of Health of âspinningâ this allegation to distract attention from its own mismanagement of the medical card system. He said payments were made to doctors in the basis of patient lists maintained by the HSE, which was also responsible for maintaining the national register of deaths. More than half the notifications of deceased patients came from doctors, who had agreed to refund any payments made after a person died. The National Association for General Practitioners said the proposal for free GP care for under-5s had placed doctors in an impossible position. The proposal was positive but as currently envisaged it would not provide doctors with the infrastructure they require to provide the level of service required. âWhile our members would obviously be delighted to attend all children on this type of scheme the reality is that they are not prepared to do so at the expense of the most vulnerable,â said association chairman Dr Andrew Jordan . âWe are now calling on the Minister for Health to explain to GPs how this scheme can be introduced without their most vulnerable patients being affected and what support the Department of Health is going to provide in this regard.â Return to results
Chelsea 3-0 Portsmouth Chelsea 3-0 Portsmouth Didier Drogba scored twice as leaders Chelsea extended their Premiership winning sequence to seven games. Petr Cech saved from Matthew Taylor before Chelsea took control with Drogba opening the scoring from short range after a neat cutback from Arjen Robben. Frank Lampard's superb pass put Robben through for the second before Yakubu missed a great chance for Pompey. Drogba scored the third with a free kick while substitute Mateja Kezman was inches from a fourth. Chelsea have not dropped a point in the Premiership since drawing 2-2 at Arsenal on 12 December and are moving inexorably towards their first Premiership title. With Arsenal not in action until Sunday, Chelsea lead Manchester United, who moved into second by beating Aston Villa, by 11 points. But Portsmouth are on a poor run of form, with just three wins in 11 Premiership games under Velimir Zajec. Pompey went into the game without the suspended Amdy Faye and Lomana LuaLua and injured duo Steve Stone and Andy Griffin. But the visitors started well, dominating possession in the opening minutes while their esteemed opponents seemed uncharacteristically sluggish. Patrik Berger struck the Chelsea wall with a free-kick and Taylor forced Cech in action with a drilled shot from a tight angle. But Chelsea soon started to assert themselves on the contest with crisp, incisive passing that Pompey struggled to contain. Robben broke down the right and did amazingly well to stay on his feet as he cut inside past Gary O'Neil before drilling a precise low cross for Drogba to tap home. The superb Robben, 21 on Sunday, scored Chelsea's second in the 21st minute. Drogba laid the ball off to Frank Lampard, whose wonderfully weighted pass caught the Pompey defence static. Robben still had a lot to do and seemed to lose his balance after rounding Jamie Ashdown but kept on his feet to convert from a very tight angle. Damien Duff came close to a third just before the half-hour mark but Ashdown saved low down. Yakubu had a great chance to bring Pompey back into the match but shot just wide when clean through after Frank Lampard's poor pass had sold Terry short. And his failure to put the opportunity away was clinically punished by Drogba, who struck a free-kick over the wall and past Ashdown after David Unsworth hacked Robben to the ground. O'Neil forced Cech into action with a free-kick after the break but the keeper was equal to the test. Both Drogba and Joe Cole scuffed opportunities to extend their lead after a teasing cross from Duff. Drogba went down under a challenge from Dejan Stefanovic but appeals for a penalty were waved away by referee Mike Riley. Mourinho introduced Eidur Gudjohnsen, Tiago and Mateja Kezman - the latter coming within inches of scoring after drilling the ball across Ashdown's goal. Lampard almost made it four close to full-time but Ashdown - at the second attempt - saved Lampard's dipping strike.

Chip maker backs net phone calls Chip maker backs net phone calls Rich Templeton, the head of giant chip maker Texas Instruments, has given his backing to the growing sector of Voice over Internet Telephony (Voip) Voip allows PC users, and in some cases those with just a broadband connection, to make telephone calls via the net. Mr Templeton said Voip would be the next major application to drive broadband connections into homes. Internet service provider Wanadoo has announced it is launching its own broadband telephony service in the UK. Subscribers to Wanadoo's broadband service will be able to use the service to make free evening and weekend calls to any UK landline, and free calls at any time to other Wanadoo users. The service will cost an extra Â£4 a month and will come with a free Livebox, the broadband hub which Wanadoo plans will be used in future to provide video-on-demand and home security services. The secondary phone line will mean customers can have an extra home phone number and will also provide wireless internet access around the home. Eventually the service will replace existing landline services as Wanadoo goes head to head with BT. "Voice-over broadband is a key trend across Europe and is set to have a dramatic impact on the telecommunications industry, " Eric Abensur, Wanadoo's chief executive told the Online News News website. Mr Templeton said he agreed. "Voice-over-packet is going to be the second killer application after broadband internet access," he said. The world's largest maker of chips for mobile phones believes the technology will grow rapidly from the relatively small user base it has currently. Almost 83 million people have downloaded the software that powers the Skype Voip service, according to the net telephony firm's website. Skype lets people make free calls to other Skype users and also make low-cost calls to ordinary phone numbers. US firm Vonage also offers a Voip service, but one which lets people plug an ordinary phone into a broadband router to make calls. Bill Simmelink, general manager of TI's Voip business, said the technology would only take off when people were making net calls with the ease of making a normal call. "It's not about the pipe, if you will, or the silicon per se, it's about the application," he said. "We want to communicate freely, effortlessly and economically wherever we are." In a sign that Voip is seeping into the mainstream, giant ISP AOL announced on Tuesday that it had plans to launch a net-based phone service for some of its members within the month. Customers will continue to use their traditional phones, but they will plug them into adapters connected to their broadband source rather than the jack provided by the telephone company. Calls are received and placed just like on the old telephone network. "We can help mass-market adoption of Voip," said AOL chief executive Jonathan Miller. "We can utilise our national footprint. We can help the entire industry become well known."
Clinical staff had not received specific training Clinical staff had not received specific training Galway University Hospital did not have a hospital-wide guideline in place for the management of sepsis in adult patients, despite treating well over 100 such cases a year, the Health Information and Quality Authority report found. Galway University Hospital did not have a hospital-wide guideline in place for the management of sepsis in adult patients, despite treating well over 100 such cases a year, the Health Information and Quality Authority report found. It said the hospital reported that 167 maternity and non-maternity patients in total required ICU care as a result of sepsis in 2011, and 139 patients required this care in 2012. âThe hospital also reported that 70 patients required High Dependency Unit (HDU) care as a result of sepsis in 2011, while 89 general patients required such care in 2012,â it said. âDespite this, the authority found that at the time of the investigation, the hospital did not have a hospital-wide guideline in place for the management of sepsis in adult patients. âFurthermore, it found that there was no consistent definition of sepsis, severe sepsis and septic shock in use across UHG.â However, the hospital had a guideline in place for the management of âsuspected sepsis and sepsis in obstetric careâ. However, the clinical governance arrangements were not robust enough to ensure adherence to this guideline. In addition, clinical staff had not received specific sepsis training in relation to the application of this policy and/or the specific management of a maternity patient with sepsis. Hiqaâs report says women with maternal infection can deteriorate rapidly from sepsis to severe sepsis and then into septic shock. However, when the authority examined the evidence available for the recording of maternal morbidity related to sepsis nationally it found there was no nationally agreed definition of maternal sepsis, and that there were inconsistencies in recording and reporting of maternal sepsis. Safety measures At the time of its investigation, there was also no agreed national dataset of quality and safety measures for maternity services in Ireland and no consistent approach to reporting clinical outcomes. âThe authority was significantly concerned about the absence of a national overview and structured assurance arrangements to monitor the safety and quality of maternity services in Ireland.â The report has recommended that the HSE should develop a national clinical guideline on the management of sepsis and ensure that all hospitals put in place arrangements for formal staff training on the recognition and management of sepsis and on the clinically deteriorating patients, including pregnant women in line with the guideline. The report said: âThis guideline should incorporate an escalation/referral pathway that includes clinical, legal and ethical guidance for staff at critical clinical points and contain key elements of patient consultation and consent in respect of their treatment and associated interventions.â Return to results
Communist leaders strongly endorse private companies at end of four-day meeting Communist leaders strongly endorse private companies at end of four-day meeting Plainclothes policemen guard in front of Tiananmen Gate outside the Great Hall of the People where the Communist Partyâs 205-member Central Committee gathered for its third annual plenum today in Beijing, China. Photograph: Feng Li/Getty Images Chinaâs leaders finished a closely watched policy meeting today with a promise to give market forces a bigger role in the countryâs state-dominated economy, but failed to produce dramatic reforms to overhaul a worn-out growth model. In a report after a four-day meeting that reform advocates hoped would unleash a wave of change, Communist Party leaders gave an unusually strong endorsement of private companies as âimportant componentsâ of the economy but said state industries will remain its core. The market will play a âdecisive roleâ in allocating resources, the party said. The official Xinhua News Agency said that was an upgrade from the âcore roleâ assigned to the market in party policy over the past two decades. It gave no indication the meeting considered any political reforms in Chinaâs closed, secretive one-party system. It said a national security council would be set up to improve security strategy. Chinese leaders are under pressure to replace a growth model based on exports and investment that delivered three decades of rapid expansion but has run out of steam. Reform advocates say Beijing should open an array of state-controlled industries to private competition, but any moves to curb the privileges of politically favored companies are likely to face resistance. The party said it will create a committee to âdeepen reformsâ and gave no indication when more changes might be approved. That suggested party leaders, as many observers expected, agreed on broad themes but put off battles over details such as the status of state companies that control vast swathes of Chinaâs economy including banking, energy and telecoms. Another key area that reformers say is ripe for change is control of land. The report said farmers should have more property rights but made no commitments. All land in China is owned by the state. Farmers are tenants who cannot mortgage or rent their land to buy better seeds and technology. Giving them ownership or at least more control would unlock wealth in the countryside but also might jolt real estate markets and affect local governments that rely on sales of land use rights for revenue. Because of that, some analysts said land reform is likely to be left until later. Before the meeting, communist leaders raised hopes and the political stakes by promising âunprecedentedâ reforms. The meeting was seen as symbolically significant because it was the 205-member Central Committeeâs third plenum â or full meeting â of the partyâs 18th congress. Such meetings at this point in the partyâs five-year political cycle are seen as a launching pad for changes in economic direction after Deng Xiaoping used a third plenum in 1978 to unveil his reforms. The plenum offered a platform for president Xi Jinping, who became party leader last year, to make clear his own vision for the worldâs second-largest economy. Communist leaders have been trying to make the economy more efficient and productive by gradually injecting more market forces into areas such as bank lending. Regulators eliminated controls on interest rates charged on commercial loans in July in a move that ultimately will lower costs for borrowers with stronger credit records. Pressure for change has mounted as economic growth tumbled to a two-decade low of 7.5 per cent in the second quarter of this year. Beijing propped up growth with a mini-stimulus of higher spending on railway construction and other public works but premier Li Keqiang , the top economic official, has said the leadership wants to focus on longer-term reforms. The government still dominates Chinaâs economy three decades after Mr Dengâs market-style reforms set its boom in motion. Entrepreneurs create Chinaâs new jobs and wealth but are treated as second-class corporate citizens and have trouble getting bank loans. The report called for ensuring the publicâs livelihood and social stability. That would include both more spending on welfare programs to ease political tensions and more intensive monitoring and policing to defuse ethnic unrest or potential political dissent. Its focus, though, was economic change, which it said will be âthe key of overall deepening of reform.â .

Company says it remains fully compliant with regulations after altering approach Company says it remains fully compliant with regulations after altering approach The ESB head office in Dublin. The company said yesterday it remained fully compliant with accountancy regulations after altering its approach to representation of its pension scheme in financial accounts following dealings with unions on a â¬2 billion pension deficit in 2010. Photograph: Cyril Byrne Mark Hilliard The ESB has dismissed concerns over the representation of its pension scheme in financial accounts following the leaking of management emails. Responding yesterday, the company said it remained fully compliant with accountancy regulations after altering its approach following dealings with unions on a â¬2 billion pension deficit in 2010. After agreement had been reached, the company changed its accounting of the scheme from defined benefit to defined contribution. It is understood that while technically a defined benefit scheme, it is not a balance of cost scheme and so does not carry the complete liability. In this regard, a source indicated, it is entitled to account for itself as defined contribution. In effect, this removes liabilities from its balance sheet thereby buoying the companyâs financial status and aiding it in borrowing billions from the markets. The matter is part of pending High Court proceedings in which details of the accountancy practice are likely to emerge. It could in theory be investigated by the Pensions Board under the Pensions Act, although a spokesman said it could not comment on individual schemes. The emails aired on RTÃâs This Week programme yesterday appeared to show management discussing that it had not informed auditors KPMG that the group of unions (GOU) disagreed with their accountancy approach. Quoting a âsenior managerâ, one reportedly said the company needed evidence to show KPMG that the unions were not âat oddsâ with them. âAs you know, the GOU were always at odds with what [was] stated in the accounts in prior years as we always said the scheme was not a typical balance of costs scheme,â it said. Formal agreement It is also alleged that the firm would not âcountenanceâ approaching the GOU to seek a formal agreement, as was apparently requested by KPMG. The manager added: âShould Brendan [ Brendan Ogle â secretary of the ESB GOU] decide he does not agree with the wording and send something to us in writing, it would unavoidably force us to change the accounting treatment and all that entailsâ. An ESB spokeswoman said the company was obliged only to keep the GOU fully briefed on any changes to accountancy practices, which it was, and did not require its approval. KPMG said it didnât comment on individual client cases. Mr Ogle could not be reached for comment. Return to results
Concerns over Windows ATMs Concerns over Windows ATMs Cash machine networks could soon be more susceptible to computer viruses, a security firm has warned. The warning is being issued because many banks are starting to use the Windows operating system in machines. Already there have been four incidents in which Windows viruses have disrupted networks of cash machines running the Microsoft operating system. But banking experts say the danger is being overplayed and that the risks of infection and disruption are small. For many years the venerable IBM operating system, known as OS/2, has been the staple software used to power many of the 1.4m cash machines in operation around the world. But IBM will end support for OS/2 in 2006 which is forcing banks to look for alternatives. There are also other pressures making banks turn to Windows said Dominic Hirsch, managing director of financial analysis firm Retail Banking Research. He said many cash machines will also have to be upgraded to make full use of the new Europay, Mastercard and Visa credit cards that use computer chips instead of magnetic stripes to store data. US laws that demand disabled people get equal access to information will also force banks to make their cash machines more versatile and able to present information in different ways. Todd Thiemann, spokesman for anti-virus firm Trend Micro, said the move to Windows in cash machines was not without risks. Mr Thiemann said research by the TowerGroup showed that 70% of new cash machines being installed were Windows based. Already, he said, there have been four incidents in which cash machines have been unavailable for hours due to viruses affecting the network of the bank that owns them. In January 2003 the Slammer worm knocked out 13,000 cash machines of the Bank of America and many of those operated by the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce. In August of the same year, cash machines of two un-named banks were put out of action for hours following an infection by the Welchia worm. Incidents like this happen, said Mr Thiemann, because when banks start using Windows cash machines they also change the networking technology used to link the devices to their back office computers. This often means that all the cash machines and computers in a bank share the same data network. "This could mean that cash machines get caught up in the viruses that are going around because they have a common transmission system," he said. "Banks need to consider protection as part of the investment to maintain the security of that network," Mr Thiemann told Online News News Online. But Mr Hirsch from Retail Banking Research said the number of cash machines actually at risk was low because so few were upgraded every year. Currently, he said, a cash machine has a lifetime of up to 10 years which means that only about 10% of all ATMs get swapped for a newer model every year. "Windows cash machines have been around for several years," he said. "Most banks simply upgrade as part of their usual replacement cycle." "In theory there is a bigger threat with Windows than OS/2," he said, "but I do not think that the banks are hugely concerned at the moment." "It's pretty unusual to hear about virus problems with ATMs," he said. The many different security systems built-in to cash machines meant there was no chance that a virus could cause them to start spitting out cash spontaneously, he said. Banks were more likely to be worried about internal networks being overwhelmed by worms and viruses and customers not being able to get cash out at all, he added. A spokesman for the Association of Payment and Clearing Services (Apacs) which represents the UK's payments industry said the risk from viruses was minimal. "There's no concern that there's going to be any type of virus hitting the UK networks," he said. Risks of infection were small because the data networks that connect UK cash machines together and the operators of the ATMs themselves were a much smaller and tightly-knit community than in the US where viruses have struck.

Conference on education addressed by past pupil Catherine Day, European Commission secretary general Conference on education addressed by past pupil Catherine Day, European Commission secretary general Mount Anville past pupil, actor Alison Doody, with Jessica Carroll (5) and Ellie Enright (3), pupils of Mount Anville Montessori Junior School, at the launch of Hearts + Minds, an exhibition at Mount Anville House marking 160 years of Sacred Heart education in Ireland. Photograph: Shane OâNeill/Fennells It was a special day for the Mount Anville schools in south Dublin yesterday. The prestigious Montessori, primary and secondary schools were celebrating 160 years to the day since nuns of the Society of the Sacred Heart opened their doors to educate Dublinâs young women. The schools â whose past pupils include former president Mary Robinson, US ambassador to the UN Samantha Power and the fictional character Sorcha OâCarroll-Kelly â celebrated with the opening of a permanent exhibition, Hearts + Minds, which details in pictures and text the orderâs contribution to womenâs education in Ireland. The anniversary celebrations also included a conference on âLeading Sacred Heart Education into the 21st Centuryâ, at which 75 delegates represented Sacred Heart societies in 11 countries. In keeping with the day that was in it, the conference was addressed by the secretary general of the European Commission, Catherine Day, a past pupil of the school. Past pupils Another past pupil, TV presenter Sybil Mulcahy, lent her services as MC for the conference, while the list of past pupils present also included actor Alison Doody, TV presenter Lisa Cannon, social entrepreneurs Caroline Casey of Kanchi and Anne Maguire of Fundraising Ireland, hockey player Emma Gray and Myra Garrett, managing partner with William Fry Solicitors. Five goals The school prides itself on an education underpinned by the five goals of the Sacred Heart: faith, character, intellect, community and social awareness, aspects of which were illustrated by photographs and text in the exhibition. The exhibition details how the Sacred Heart opened its first school in Ireland in 1842 in Roscrea, Co Tipperary, and its next school in Armagh in 1851. In 1853 the order established the âDublinâ school in Glasnevin. The Dublin enterprise transferred to Mount Anville in 1865. In 2007 the Sacred Heart nuns handed over the running of the schools to a trust, designed to preserve the educational ethos. But the Society of the Sacred Heart trains its daughters well: if Catherine Day was surprised to learn the school had originated on Dublinâs northside she did not raise so much as an eyebrow. Recollections âThat is the where the telephone used to be,â she said, breaking off a discussion about how pleased the EU was with Irelandâs bailout, and indicating what appeared to be a small cupboard in a passageway. âThat is where I heard what I got in my Leaving Certificate.â Nearby, the schoolsâ appointed public relations representative was explaining that for all its success and legacy, Mount Anville was not the Stateâs most expensive girlsâ school. At â¬5,100 per year, the secondary school was less expensive than Alexandra College in Milltown, she said, and cheaper too than St Andrewâs College in Booterstown, which caters for both boys and girls. Nor she said, just as The Online News thought of it, was Mount Anville the most expensive single-gender, private school. âHoly Child in Killiney is a religious girlsâ school and is more expensive too.â Comments are closed for this article.
Consumers 'snub portable video' Consumers 'snub portable video' Consumers want music rather than movies while on the move, says a report. Produced by Jupiter Research the analysis of the portable media player market found only 13% of Europeans want to watch video while out and about. By contrast, almost a third are interested in listening to music on a portable player such as an iPod. The firm said gadget makers should avoid hybrid devices and instead make sure music reproduction was as good as possible. The report concluded that the driving force behind the growth of Europe's portable player market was likely to be music, rather than films or any combination of the two. Barely 5% of those questioned said they wanted a player that could play back both music and movies. Only 7% wanted a player that could handle games and video. "Dedicated music players are the only established digital media players in Europe today despite their high prices," said Ian Fogg, Jupiter analyst. Mr Fogg said although video players and smartphones were trying to cash in on this success they faced a tough job because of the compromises that had to be made when creating a dual-purpose device. "Europeans care most about music playback," he said. The report showed that 27% of consumers asked are interested in portable music players. The research revealed that French, 39%, and British, 31%, consumers were most interested in music players. Mr Fogg said portable video players were likely to remain a niche product that would not be able to compete with devices dedicated to music playback. A separate report by Jupiter forecasts that the European digital music market will grow to 836m euros (Â£581m) by 2009. At the end of 2003, the market was worth 10.6m euros (Â£7.36m). Digital music players will be behind this market growth said Jupiter . Apple's iPod was launched in October 2001, but the portable music player market has been growing steadily since the launch of the Creative Nomad Jukebox in mid-2000. Now consumers face an almost overwhelming choice of high-capacity portable music players that let them store every track on every CD that they own. Return to results
Court mulls file-sharing future Court mulls file-sharing future Judges at the US Supreme Court have been hearing evidence for and against file-sharing networks. The court will decide whether producers of file-sharing software can ultimately be held responsible for copyright infringement. They questioned if opening the way for the entertainment industry to sue file-sharers could deter innovation. They also said that file-trading firms had some responsibility for inducing people to piracy. The lawsuit, brought by 28 of the world's largest entertainment firms, has raged for several years. Legal experts agree that if the Supreme Court finds in favour of the music and movie industry they would be able to sue file-trading firms into bankruptcy. But if the judge rules that Grokster and Morpheus - the file-sharers at the centre of the case - are merely providers of technology that can have legitimate as well as illegitimate uses, then the music and movie industry would be forced to abandon its pursuit of file-sharing providers. Instead, they would have to pursue individuals who use peer-to-peer networks to get their hands on free music and movies. The hi-tech and entertainment industries have been divided on the issue. Intel filed a document with the Supreme Court earlier this month in defence of Grokster and others, despite misgivings about some aspects of the file-sharing community. It summed up the attitude of many tech firms in its submission which states that its products "are essentially tools, that like any other tools, capable of being used by consumers and businesses for unlawful purposes". Asking firms to second-guess the uses that its technologies would be put to, and to build in ways of preventing illegitimate use, would stifle innovation, it said. The Electronic Frontier Foundation, a civil rights watchdog, is also defending StreamCast Networks, the company behind the Morpheus file-sharing software. The case raises a question of critical importance at the border between copyright and innovation, it said. It cites, as do many, the landmark ruling in 1984 which found that Sony should not be held responsible for the fact that its Betamax video recorder could be used for piracy. Defenders remain optimistic that the judges will rule in favour of the peer-to-peer networks, upholding the precedent set by the Sony Betamax case. A small band of supporters were outside the court as the lawyers entered, wearing "Save Betamax" t-shirts. "The Betamax principles stand as the Magna Carta for the technology industry and are responsible for the explosion in innovation that has occurred in the US over the past 20 years," said Gary Shapiro, chief executive of the Consumer Electronics Association. Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer said that inventions from printing to Apple's iPod could be used to illegally duplicate copyrighted materials but had, on balance, been beneficial to society. He said that while file-trading software can be used to illegally trade movies and music, conceptually the technology had "some really excellent uses". Based on Tuesday's hearing it seems unlikely that the Betamax ruling will be overturned but file-sharing firms might still be held responsible for encouraging or inducing piracy. Grokster's lawyer argued that the company should be judged by its current behaviour rather than what it did when it first set up. But this argument was dismissed as "ridiculous" by Justice David Souter. CEA boss Mr Shapiro thinks the case is the most important that the Supreme Court will hear this year. "It's about preserving America's proud history of technological innovation and protecting the ability of consumers to access and utilise technology," he said. The case has already been heard by two lower courts and both found in favour of the peer-to-peer networks. They ruled that despite being used to distribute millions of illegal songs, file-sharing could also be used to cheaply distribute software, government documents and promotional copies of music.

Crusaders 2-3 Ballymena United Crusaders 2-3 Ballymena United Ballymena United came back from a goal down to take the Daily Mirror Irish Premier League points at Seaview despite a late fightback by Crusaders. Darren Stirling gave the Crues the lead before Matthew Nolan and then Oran Kearney put the visitors in front. Nolan stretched his side's lead with his second goal early in the second half. However, Crusaders never gave up and Chris Morrow fired in their second goal but it was too late to retrieve the situation. After a dull opening period, the game came alive in the 25th minute when Stirling put the Crues in front when he fired home a shot from a Morrow cross. But Ballymena stormed back with two goals before the break. In the 28th minute the energetic Rory Hamill floated over a free-kick and Nolan, the on-loan striker from nodded past Neil Armstrong. Hamill again was the instigator four minutes later when he threaded through a pass for Kearney to latch on to and plant an unstoppable shot into the net. Ballymena increased their lead six minutes after the restart when Nolan pounced on a Stevie Livingstone deflection to grab his second goal. Crusaders made sure that Ballymena had a nervous final few minutes when Morrow darted in to score. Comments are closed for this article.
Delayed data shows US economy lacks momentum Delayed data shows US economy lacks momentum This monthâs government shutdown delayed the release of job creation figures, which show that US job numbers are weaker than expected. Photograph: Christopher Cauble/Online News Payrolls climbed less than projected in September, indicating the US economy had little momentum leading up to the federal government shutdown. The jobless rate fell to an almost five-year low. The addition of 148,000 workers followed a revised 193,000 rise in August that was larger than initially estimated, Labor Department figures showed today in Washington. Unemployment fell to 7.2 per cent, the lowest level since November 2008. The report, delayed by the 16-day shutdown that ended October 17th, was originally slated for October 4th. Progress in the labor market depends on how quickly the worldâs largest economy can bounce back from the loss of business caused by the fiscal impasse. âHiring will remain modestly positive,â Jason Schenker, president of Prestige Economics in Austin, Texas, said before the report. âThe unemployment rate will come down very gradually. The shutdown came at an inopportune time.â The unemployment rate, derived from a separate Labor Department survey of households rather than employers, was forecast to hold at 7.3 per cent. The participation rate held at 63.2 per cent, matching the lowest since August 1978. The September payroll figure reflects the pay period that includes the 12th of the month, two weeks prior to the federal shutdown. Todayâs report doesnât include any late responses from employers, indicating the figures will be subject to revision as is typical each month. It will take some time to confirm or refute that the shutdown and political brinkmanship in Washington led to a sharp pullback in activity this month, so the data may be discounted, some economists said. âSince the economy is potentially in flux and the data for October and November are subject to an unusual degree of distortion. Fed policy makers are probably going to maintain stimulus for several more months, Stephen Stanley, chief economist at Pierpont Securities LLC in Stamford, Connecticut said.

EU commissioner says Irish exports remain resilient and domestic demand is rising EU commissioner says Irish exports remain resilient and domestic demand is rising Olli Rehn said unemployment levels in Ireland and Spain had begun to fall but still remained too high. Photograph: Andrew Harrer/Online News EU economic and monetary affairs commissioner Olli Rehn has said both Ireland and Spain are âon track for a successful conclusionâ of their bailout programmes. Speaking at a Eurogroup press conference in Luxembourg this morning, Mr Rehn said the financial support provided to both countries by the EU-IMF had âhelped to deliver an economic turnaroundâ. He noted that Ireland had posted positive growth every year since the beginning of the programme. âExports have remained resilient and there are signs that domestic demand is picking up.â He said unemployment levels in both countries had begun to fall, but still remain âmuch too highâ. Mr Rehn said that the Central Bank of Ireland would complete its balance sheet assessment in the coming weeks, and the Bank of Spain would carry out an analysis of the future resilience of its banking sector. âWithout prejudging the outcome of these exercises, we can say that both countries have a very good chance of successfully concluding their programmes in a sustainable manner,â he said. .

EU confirms investigation of Germanyâs trade surplus EU confirms investigation of Germanyâs trade surplus New EU rules allow in-depth review of member states to identify imbalances EU economic and monetary affairs commissioner Olli Rehn: he suggested an inquiry could help end a long-runningÂ dialogue between Germany and its critics. Photograph: Online News/Francois Lenoir The battle over Berlinâs record trade surplus moved up a gear today as the European Commission decided to prepare an in-depth analysis of Germanyâs persistently high current account surplus to find out if it is a sign of a serious imbalance in Europeâs biggest economy. New EU rules, demanded by Berlin and others as a response to the euro crisis allow Brussels to launch in-depth review of any member state flagged as showing competitiveness problems or macroeconomic imbalances. Germany now faces a so-called macroeconomic imbalance procedure, in which the commission probes economic data and can even demand action where the current account surplus exceeds 6 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP) over three years. Failure to implement commission recommendations could end with the commission imposing a fine of 0.1 per cent of GDP. The EU will recommend steps to fix the problem if the review, due to be finished early next year, finds the surplus is harmful. âA high surplus does not necessarily mean that there is an imbalance,â European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso told a news conference. âWe do need to examine this further and understand whether a high surplus in Germany is something affecting the functioning of the European economy as a whole.â High-wire act Launching an investigation into Europeâs largest member state could prove a high-wire act for the Brussels executive, plunging it into a highly-politicised economic blame game for the euro-zone crisis. Germanyâs critics say that its consistent current account surplus â exporting more goods and services than it imports â has been a key factor in the euro-zone crisis. The single currency has given German manufacturers a competitive advantage, they argue, allowing them steal a march on many euro-area competitors. The combined profits and private savings of cautious German consumers, the critics argue, flowed through the euro banking system as investment capital to the periphery and, in the case of Ireland , helpedÂ inflate the property bubble. Berlin consistently dismisses these criticisms, saying it should not be punished for the competitiveness of its globalised exporters. Of late Berlin has adopted a more differentiated tone: acknowledging imbalances in the past while insisting that Germanyâs biggestÂ export growth markets are now outside Europe . German exports to the euro zone dropped from 4.4 per cent in 2007 to 2.2 per cent last year. European commissioner for economic and monetary affairs, Olli Rehn yesterday suggested an inquiry could help end a long-runningÂ dialogue between Germany and its critics who âsimplify a complex reality in a way that kills any serious policy debateâ.Any review of Germany would be open-ended, he insisted, and focused on removing âbottlenecks for demand growthâ. The long-simmering row over Germanyâs excess of exports over imports burst into the open last week when the US accusedÂ Germany of pursuing economic profit at the expense of its euro-area partners. Record trade surplus Economic data released last week added to the debate, showingÂ Germanyâs trade surplus hit a new record in September. The seasonally adjusted trade surplus widened to â¬18.8 billion in September while the current account surplus was up 8 per cent year-on-year to â¬19.7 billion â well above the 6 per cent threshold considered excessive in the EU. Mr Rehn pointed out yesterday that Germanyâs export surplus has exceeded 6 per cent every year since 2007. Berlin is expected to launch an energetic defence, pointing to rising domestic demand and a recent IMF analysis arguing that its trade surplus, forecast to drop below 6 per cent next year, is not the result of political failings in Berlin.

Economist says credit line would be âpreferableâ Economist says credit line would be âpreferableâ Irish 10-year bonds largely unchanged following announcement A screengrab of a graph showing the trend on Irish government bonds since March. Mark Hilliard The Governmentâs decision to exit the bailout programme without a credit line has been was met with caution by some financial analysts. According to Juliet Tennant , economist at Goodbody capital markets, opting for a safety net would have been preferable. âThe Government is indeed in a comfortable funding position [BUT]we would have preferred to see the Government apply for a precautionary credit line; not only for the safety net it would have provided but also the additional external surveillance that would have ensured that momentum in the implementation of the outstanding bailout programme reforms would be maintained,â she said. âHowever, Irelandâs decision to exit alone shows confidence in its ability to fund itself and may well be viewed favourably by the ratings agencies, particularly Moodyâs.â There was little market reaction immediately following the announcement, with Irish 10-year bonds trading at 3.533 having opened slightly higher at 3.556. Taoiseach Enda Kenny informed the DÃ¡il of the decision this morning, ahead of a meeting of European finance ministers this afternoon at which Michael Noonan will give a briefing on the decision surrounding the December 15th exit. The Government, in support of the move, also pointed to historically low levels of bond yields and an improvement in public finances with the country now on track to meet the deficit reduction of less than 3 per cent by 2015. Euro area safeguards are also in place, including the ESM and the support of the European Central Bank , it said.
European tax move will not affect Ireland European tax move will not affect Ireland But change to parent-subsidiary directive is seen as opening salvo in effort to address corporate tax avoidance Taxation commissioner Algirdas Å emeta said: âTodayâs proposal will ensure that the spirit, as well as the letter, of our law is respected.â Photograph: EPA/Olivier Hoslet Corporate tax legislation changes proposed by the European Commission will have no effect on Ireland as they address a difficulty that does not exist in this jurisdiction. But tax experts warned that the announcement by the commission yesterday is the opening salvo in a global project to address aggressive corporate tax planning which could see new rules introduced that could have positive or negative implications for Ireland, depending on their nature. Double non-taxation The commission said that measures introduced to stop double-taxation have been used by some companies to achieve double non-taxation. In fact, some companies have been managing to use the loophole to get a tax credit in one country without incurring a mirroring tax liability in another. The plans will tackle gaps in the taxation of âhybridâ instruments, such as convertible preference shares. First issued in 1990, the parent-subsidiary directive allows a subsidiary that makes a profit in one country transfer that profit as a dividend to its parent in another EU country without incurring further taxation. However, some companies have put in place certain arrangements that end up treating interest on a loan from the parent company as a deductible expense in the subsidiaryâs jurisdiction while the payment is treated as a non-taxable dividend in the parent companyâs jurisdiction. The proposed change does not affect Ireland, according to Fergal OâRourke, head of taxation at PricewaterhouseCoopers because, under Irish law, such dividends and quasi-dividends from abroad are already taxed. He said the announcement yesterday is an initial step in the EU setting out to eradicate taxation misalignments and asymmetries across the union. The crackdown, which would hit one of the most common forms of international tax planning, follows growing public pressure for action against avoidance. The EU proposals come at a time when international authorities are mounting a concerted attack on âhybridâ structures that allow corporations to exploit mismatches between different countriesâ tax systems to escape taxation. Wide-ranging global plans to tackle hybrids have been drawn up by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and are now being circulated around tax authorities. Hybrid schemes Cross-border financing structures that rely on hybrids are âkeyâ to many European multinationalsâ low tax rates, according to an analysis by Citigroup. Edward Kleinbard, a law professor at the University of Southern California, said the structures created an effective subsidy for the acquisition of US companies by foreign multinationals. âThe result is global inefficiency and a very large shortfall in tax revenues around the world,â he said. Algirdas Å emeta, commissioner for taxation, said EU tax policy is heavily focused on creating a better environment for businesses in the EU. âThis means breaking down tax barriers and tackling cross-border problems such as double taxation,â he said. âBut when our rules are abused to avoid paying any tax at all, then we need to adjust them. Todayâs proposal will ensure that the spirit, as well as the letter, of our law is respected. âAs such, it will ensure greater revenues for national budgets and fairer competition for our businesses.â â Additional reporting: The Financial Times Limited 2013 Latest Economy Return to results
Every citizen should be deeply worried Every citizen should be deeply worried Report into cricumstances of Savita Halappanavarâs death has added little in the way of fresh information The other investigation with similarities was into the death of Tania McCabe in 2007 at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital (above) in Drogheda, after delivering twins â one of whom also died. Yesterdayâs report into the circumstances of Savita Halappanavarâs death, has, not unexpectedly, added little in the way of fresh information that had not already emerged from the inquest into her death and a previously published HSE investigation. There were critical basic omissions in her care, including a failure to record her vital signs, which in turn led to a delay in the recognition of her clinical deterioration. Where the latest report cuts new ground is in charting the wider deficiencies in the health system, both in University Hospital Galway and nationally. Deficits in care The health watchdog has determined that there were deficits for maternity patients attending the hospital during core hours, involving patients not being initially assessed and receiving ultrasound tests in a timely manner. Patient healthcare records were not managed in line with the HSEâs standards and recommended practices. Astonishingly, the National Maternity Health Care Record was not in use in at the hospital. But it is at a national level that the report should send a shiver down the spine of every citizen. We are all potential patients of the Stateâs public hospitals and must be seriously concerned that, in essence, the Hiqa investigation team has uncovered several examples of corporate negligence by the HSE. The finding that only five of the countryâs 19 maternity units/hospitals were able to provide a status report on the implementation of recommendations from an investigation with many similarities to the Halappanavar case is utterly damning. The other investigation with similarities was into the death of Tania McCabe in 2007 at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda, after delivering twins â one of whom also died. The pathologist concluded cause of death was as a result of multiorgan failure and post-partum haemorrhage due to sepsis. The HSE reported that the McCabe recommendations were implemented at a local HSE level with regional HSE oversight. But when it looked for evidence, Hiqa found âonly five of the 19 hospitals/units were able to provide a detailed status update on the implementation of recommendationsâ. Remember the 2006 Lourdes hospital inquiry into the Caesarean section rates of Michael Neary , consultant obstetrician at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda? It recommended that annual clinical reports of activity and clinical outcomes should be prepared and published within nine months of the previous yearâs end. During this investigation, Hiqa found that, some seven years later, eight of the 19 units do not produce any form of annual clinical report. A key paragraph in yesterdayâs report says: âThe lack of a nationally co-ordinated approach to the implementation of the recommendations of the HSE inquiry into the death of Tania McCabe, the lack of local governance arrangements to ensure that recommendations as applicable to their particular service are implemented, and the ambiguity regarding who has the overall ownership of and responsibility for implementing the National Clinical Care Programmes again raises a fundamental and worrying deficit in our health system.â Future harm In other words, the inability of HSE management to implement important changes arising from adverse patient events in a timely manner means that, despite being aware of specific risks, it is failing to take actions that will prevent future harm and even death to patients. It is now time for senior HSE managers to face rigorous scrutiny, and where appropriate, meaningful sanctions for their inaction. .

FA charges Mourinho FA charges Mourinho Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho has been charged with improper conduct by the Football Association. The move follows comments on Chelsea TV after the Carling Cup semi-final first leg draw against Manchester United. Mourinho suggested United boss Sir Alex Ferguson had put pressure on referee Neale Barry at half-time. The Chelsea boss, who has until 14 February to respond, said: "In the second half it was whistle and whistle, fault and fault, cheat and cheat." However, the FA will not take action over comments on the same issue by Chelsea defender John Terry after the match. Terry said: "With most refs and being captain, you can maybe have a word, but he just wasn't willing to listen which was disappointing." In a statement, the FA said it had "reviewed the content and context of these comments, (and) decided that it is not appropriate to take formal disciplinary action." Return to results
Fast moving phone viruses appear Fast moving phone viruses appear Security firms are warning about several mobile phone viruses that can spread much faster than similar bugs. The new strains of the Cabir mobile phone virus use short-range radio technology to leap to any vulnerable phone as soon as it is in range. The Cabir virus only affects high-end handsets running the Symbian Series 60 phone operating system. Despite the warnings, there are so far no reports of any phones being infected by the new variants of Cabir. The original Cabir worm came to light in mid-June 2004 when it was sent to anti-virus firms as a proof-of-concept program. A mistake in the way the original Cabir was written meant that even if it escaped from the laboratory, the bug would only have been able to infect one phone at a time. However, the new Cabir strains have this mistake corrected and will spread via short range Bluetooth technology to any vulnerable phone in range. Bluetooth has an effective range of a few tens of metres. The risk of being infected by Cabir is low because users must give the malicious program permission to download on to their handset and then must manually install it. Users can protect themselves by altering a setting on Symbian phones that conceals the handset from other Bluetooth using devices. Finnish security firm F-Secure issued a warning about the new strains of Cabir but said that the viruses do not do any damage to a phone. All they do is block normal Bluetooth activity and drain the phone's battery. Anti-virus firm Sophos said the source code for Cabir had been posted on the net by a Brazilian programmer which might lead to even more variants of the program being created. So far seven versions of Cabir are know to exist, one of which was inside the malicious Skulls program that was found in late November. Symbian's Series 60 software is licenced by Nokia, LG Electronics, Lenovo, Panasonic, Samsung, Sendo and Siemens. Comments are closed for this article.
Featured: 'Evil twin' fear for wireless net 'Evil twin' fear for wireless net People using wireless high-speed net (wi-fi) are being warned about fake hotspots, or access points. The latest threat, nicknamed evil twins, pose as real hotspots but are actually unauthorised base stations, say Cranfield University experts. Once logged onto an Evil Twin, sensitive data can be intercepted. Wi-fi is becoming popular as more devices come with wireless capability. London leads the global wi-fi hotspots league, with more than 1,000. The number of hotspots is expected to reach 200,000 by 2008, according to analysts. "Users need to be wary of using their wi-fi enabled laptops or other portable devices in order to conduct financial transactions or anything that is of a sensitive or personal nature," said Professor Brian Collins, head of information systems at Cranfield University. "Users can also protect themselves by ensuring that their wi-fi device has its security measures activated," he added. BT Openzone, which operates a vast proportion of public hotspots in the UK, told the Online News News website that it made every effort to make its wi-fi secure. "Naturally, people may have security concerns," said Chris Clark, chief executive for BT's wireless broadband. "But wi-fi networks are no more or less vulnerable than any other means of accessing the internet, like broadband or dial-up." He said BT Openzone, as well as others, have sophisticated encryption from the start of the login process to the service at a hotspot. "This means that users' personal information and data, logon usernames and passwords are protected and secure," said Mr Clark. In the vast majority of cases, base stations straight out of the box from the manufacturers are automatically set up with the least secure mode possible, said Dr Nobles. Cybercriminals who try to glean personal information using the scam, jam connections to a legitimate base station by sending a stronger signal near to the wireless client. Anyone with the right gear can find a real hotspot and substitute it with an evil twin. "Cybercriminals don't have to be that clever to carry out such an attack," said Dr Phil Nobles, a wireless net and cybercrime expert at Cranfield. "Because wireless networks are based on radio signals they can be easily detected by unauthorised users tuning into the same frequency." Although wi-fi is increasing in popularity as more people want to use high-speed net on the move, there have been fears over how secure it is. Some companies have been reluctant to use them in large numbers because of fears about security. A wireless network that is not protected can provide a backdoor into a company's computer system. Public wi-fi hotspots offered by companies like BT Openzone and The Cloud, are accessible after users sign up and pay for use. But many home and company wi-fi networks are left unprotected and can be "sniffed out" and hi-jacked by anyone with the correct equipment. "BT advises that customers should change all default settings, make sure that their security settings on all equipment are configured correctly," said Mr Clark. "We also advocate the use of personal firewalls to ensure that only authorised users can have access and that data cannot be intercepted." Dr Nobles is due to speak about wireless cybercrime at the Science Museum's Dana Centre in London on Thursday. Comments are closed for this article.
Ferguson rues failure to cut gap Ferguson rues failure to cut gap Boss Sir Alex Ferguson was left ruing Manchester United's failure to close the gap on Chelsea, Everton and Arsenal after his side's 1-1 draw with Fulham. Premiership leaders Chelsea and the Gunners endured a 2-2 stalemate on Sunday, giving United the chance to make up some ground in the league. But Ferguson said: "I think what makes it so bad is that both our rivals dropped points at the weekend. "It was a great opportunity - and we haven't delivered." United went ahead through Alan Smith in the 33rd minute before Bouba Diop's superb 25-yard strike cancelled out the visitors' lead in the 87th minute. Ferguson described the result as an "absolute giveaway" after United had earlier missed a host of opportunities to finish off the encounter. He said: "It was a good performance - some of the football was fantastic - but we just didn't finish them off. "In fairness, it's a fantastic strike from the Fulham player." The result leaves Ferguson's side fourth in the league on 31 points - four points behind Arsenal and a further five back from Chelsea. Return to results
Format wars could 'confuse users' Format wars could 'confuse users' Technology firms Sony, Philips, Matsushita and Samsung are developing a common way to stop people pirating digital music and video. The firms want to make a system that ensures files play on the hardware they make but also thwarts illegal copying. The move could mean more confusion for consumers already faced by many different, and conflicting, content control systems, experts warned. They say there are no guarantees the system will even prevent piracy. Currently many online stores wrap up downloadable files in an own-brand control system that means they can only be played on a small number of media players. Systems that limit what people can do with the files they download are known as Digital Rights Management systems. By setting up the alliance to work on a common control system, the firms said they hope to end this current fragmentation of file formats. In a joint statement the firms said they wanted to let consumers enjoy "appropriately licensed video and music on any device, independent of how they originally obtained that content". The firms hope that it will also make it harder for consumers to make illegal copies of the music, movies and other digital content they have bought. Called the Marlin Joint Development Association, the alliance will define basic specifications that every device made by the electronics firms will conform to. Marlin will be built on technology from rights management firm Intertrust as well as an earlier DRM system developed by a group known as the Coral Consortium. The move is widely seen as a way for the four firms to decide their own destiny on content control systems instead of having to sign up for those being pushed by Apple and Microsoft. Confusingly for consumers, the technology that comes out of the alliance will sit alongside the content control systems of rival firms such as Microsoft and Apple. "In many ways the different DRM systems are akin to the different physical formats, such as Betamax and VHS, that consumers have seen in the past," said Ian Fogg, personal technology and broadband analyst at Jupiter Research. "The difference is that it is very fragmented," he said. "It's not a two-horse race, it's a five, six, seven or even eight-horse race" Mr Fogg said consumers had to be very careful when buying digital content to ensure that it would play on the devices they own. He said currently there were even incompatibilities within DRM families. Although initiatives such as Microsoft's "Plays for Sure" program could help remove some of the uncertainty, he said, life was likely to be confusing for consumers for some time to come. Shelley Taylor, analyst and author of a report about online music services, said the locks and limits on digital files were done to maximise the cash that firms can make from consumers. Apple's iTunes service was a perfect example of this, she said. "Although iTunes has been hugely successful, Apple could not justify its existence if it did not help sell all those iPods," she said. She said rampant competition between online music services, of which there are now 230 according to recent figures, could drive more openness and freer file formats. "It always works out that consumer needs win out in the long run," she said, "and the services that win in the long run are the ones that listen to consumers earliest." Ms Taylor said the limits legal download services place on files could help explain the continuing popularity of file-sharing systems that let people get hold of pirated pop. "People want portability," she said, "and with peer-to-peer they have 100% portability." Cory Doctorow, European co-ordinator for the Electronic Frontier Foundation which campaigns for consumers on many cyber-rights issues, expressed doubts that the Marlin system would achieve its aims. "Not one of these systems has ever prevented piracy or illegal copying," he said. He said many firms readily admit that their DRM systems are little protection against skilled attackers such as the organised crime gangs that are responsible for most piracy. Instead, said Mr Doctorow, DRM systems were intended to control the group that electronics firms have most hold over - consumers. "The studios and labels perceive an opportunity to sell you your media again and again - the iPod version, the auto version, the American and UK version, the ringtone version, and so on."

Gadget show heralds MP3 Christmas Gadget show heralds MP3 Christmas Partners of those who love their hi-tech gear may want to get their presents in early as experts predict a gadget shortage this Christmas. With Apple's iPod topping wish lists again, there may not be enough iPod minis to go round, predicts Oliver Irish, editor of gadget magazine Stuff. "The iPod mini is likely to be this year's Tracey Island," said Mr Irish. Stuff has compiled a list of the top 10 gadgets for 2004 and the iPod is at number one. For anyone bewildered by the choice of gadgets on the market, Stuff and What Hi-Fi? are hosting a best-of gadget show in London this weekend. Star of the show will be Sony's Qrio Robot, an all-singing, all-dancing, football-playing man-machine who can even hold intelligent conversations. But he is not for sale and Sony has no commercial plans for the robot. "He will greet visitors and is flying in from Japan. He probably has his own airplane seat, that is how highly Sony prize him," said Mr Irish. Also on display will be a virtual keyboard which projects itself onto any flat surface. The event will play host to a large collection of digital music players, from companies such as Creative, Sony and Philips as well as the ubiquitously fashionable iPod from Apple. Suggestions that it could be a gaming or wireless Christmas are unlikely to come true as MP3 players remain the most popular stocking filler, said Mr Irish. "Demand is huge and Apple has promised that it can supply enough but people might struggle to get their hands on iPod minis," said Mr Irish. For those who like their gadgets to be multi-talented, the Gizmondo, a powerful gaming console with GPS and GPRS, that also doubles up as an MP3 player, movie player and camera, could be a must-have. "What is impressive is how much it can do and how well it can do them," said Mr Irish. This Christmas, gadgets will not be an all-male preserve. "Women will be getting gadgets from husbands and boyfriends as well as buying them for themselves," said Mr Irish. "Gadgets nowadays are lifestyle products rather than just for geeks."

Good governance can be linked directly to the level of transparency and accountability that operates... Good governance can be linked directly to the level of transparency and accountability that operates within a society. It is marked by broad support for administrative structures and public confidence in social justice. This State wandered far from those ideals as its defining attributes became a lack of accountability, excessive secrecy and undue control. An opportunity to address those failings has arisen. The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has published a document - coordinated by the anti-corruption agency Transparency International Ireland - that recommends a range of measures in support of administrative reform. Much of what is proposed has been awaiting implementation for decades, but was successfully resisted by a variety of interests. What is heartening on this occasion is the imprimatur offered by a Government department and the implied commitment by Brendan Howlin to a new beginning. There is, of course, a political agenda. Establishing a commission of inquiry into the financial failures that led to the bank guarantee is top of the coalitionâs wish list. Such a commission would âmake findings of responsibilityâ; offer recommendations on how a repeat of the banking collapse might be avoided and refer files to the Director of Public Prosecutions . Such an inquiry may be useful on many levels, but other suggested initiatives are equally pressing. Financial crimes legislation that would penalise reckless trading and malfeasance in office is long overdue. So are strict standards of financial transparency and responsibility in the conduct of audits and the establishment of a bankersâ charter. Within Government, there is no compelling reason why the concept of Cabinet confidentiality should prevent publication of its agenda, minutes and relevant documents. Greater oversight and transparency should also be introduced into traditional areas of discretionary decision making by public servants. Politicians are reluctant to confront these issues because they represent avenues for vote-getting. Transparency International has suggested that a referendum on a Bill of Rights and Responsibilities should be held within two years. This would set down the entitlements of all citizens and their concomitant responsibilities. At a time when local government is being restructured, empowered and funded through a property tax, such a development would help to erode an unwarranted dependence on national politicians to secure statutory entitlements for constituents. A culture of âthe inside trackâ and âwho you knowâ is corrosive in any society. It is particularly destructive in one where innovation, experimentation and upward social mobility are vital for success. A radical shake-up of established patterns of behaviour is required. .

HSE withheld 63,000 claims by family doctors over patterns of concern HSE withheld 63,000 claims by family doctors over patterns of concern The HSE withheld payment on almost 63,000 claims by family doctors for out-of-hours work after identifying claiming patterns of concern, it says. Photograph: Hugh Macknight/PA Wire The HSE withheld payment on almost 63,000 claims by family doctors for out-of-hours work after identifying claiming patterns of concern, it says. The review was carried out as part of routine probity and audit measures in 2009 and resulted in the HSE being unable to verify the reasonableness and accuracy of some claims, according to a spokeswoman. After discussions with the Irish Medical Organisation , the two sides entered into a binding arbitration process to resolve the unpaid claims. Claims submitted The HSE says it received almost 441,000 out-of-hours claims submitted by 264 doctors between February 2011 and July 2013. Of these, payment was withheld in respect of 62,966 claims. Under the mediation agreement, the HSE paid 211 GPs the full amount of their unpaid claims, amounting to â¬537,000. A partial payment was offered to the remaining 53 GPs, totalling â¬377,204 in respect of 28,543 claims. In one case, a doctor who claimed â¬186,000 in back fees was offered a settlement of â¬15,000. GPs have until the end of October to accept the settlement offer or exercise their right to appeal. The IMO said the vast majority of the 2,200 GPs in the scheme and providing out-of-hours services were not in dispute with the HSE over payments. Return to results
Halo 2 sells five million copies Halo 2 sells five million copies Microsoft is celebrating bumper sales of its Xbox sci-fi shooter, Halo 2. The game has sold more than five million copies worldwide since it went on sale in mid-November, the company said. Halo 2 has proved popular online, with gamers notching up a record 28 million hours playing the game on Xbox Live. According to Microsoft, nine out of 10 Xbox Live members have played the game for an average of 91 minutes per session. The sequel to the best-selling Need for Speed: Underground has inched ahead of the competition to take the top slot in the official UK games charts. The racing game moved up one spot to first place, nudging GTA: San Andreas down to second place. Halo 2 dropped one place to five, while Half-Life 2 fell to number nine. Last week's new releases, GoldenEye: Rogue Agent and Killzone, both failed to make it into the top 10, debuting at number 11 and 12 respectively. Record numbers of Warcraft fans are settling in the games online world. On the opening day of the World of Warcraft massive multi-player online game more than 200,000 players signed up to play. On the evening of the first day more than 100,000 players were in the world, forcing Blizzard to add another 34 servers to cope with the influx. The online game turns the stand alone Warcraft games into a persistent world that players can inhabit not just visit Europe's gamers could be waiting until January to hear when they can get their mitts on Nintendo's handheld device, Nintendo DS, says gamesindustry.biz. David Yarnton, Nintendo UK general manager, told a press conference to look out for details in the New Year. Its US launch was on Sunday and it goes on sale in Japan on 2 December. Nintendo has a 95% share of the handheld gaming market and said it expected to sell around five million of the DS by March 2005. Comments are closed for this article.
Hollywood to sue net film pirates Hollywood to sue net film pirates The US movie industry has launched legal action to sue people who facilitate illegal film downloading. The Motion Picture Association of America wants to stop people using the program BitTorrent to swap movies. The industry is targeting people who run websites which provide information and internet links to movies which have been copied or filmed in cinemas. More than 100 server operators have been targeted in the actions launched in the US and UK, the MPAA added. The suits were filed against users of the file-sharing programs BitTorrent, eDonkey and DirectConnect in the United States, United Kingdom, France, Finland and the Netherlands, the MPAA said. BitTorrent users can download movies by following a link to files which are found on websites called trackers. Unlike most peer-to-peer programs BitTorrent works by sharing a file, which could be anything from a legitimate digital photo to a copied movie, among multiple users at the same time. The movie industry hopes that suing the people who run the trackers will cut BitTorrent users off from illegal movies at source. Last month major film studios started legal action against 200 individuals who were swapping films online. The growth in broadband has made it quicker for people to download movies and the industry fears that if it does not take action now, it could suffer the same downturn as the music industry.

IMO considers invitation to LRC talks in doctorsâ dispute IMO considers invitation to LRC talks in doctorsâ dispute Kenny urges return to negotiating table as 3,000 doctors protest over working hours The Irish Medical Organisation has said it had received an invitation to attend talks at the Labour Relations Commission on the doctorâs strike tomorrow morning. A spokesman said the IMOâs non consultant hospital doctor committee would meet tomorrow to consider whether or not to accept the invitation. Doctors have called on health chiefs to see sense in the long-running dispute over working hours and avoid a second strike. Fifty-one hospitals were hit by a walk-out by 3,000 non-consultant hospital doctors with pickets placed outside at least eight hospitals for most of the day. Eric Young , IMO assistant director of industrial relations, said its members were united, strong and determined to see this campaign through to a successful conclusion. âWe will continue to try and minimise the impact of this dispute on patients but we must continue the campaign until the HSE sees sense and brings an end to this sorry chapter of the abuse of NCHDs and patients,â he said. The strike began at 7am and will continue until midnight tonight with hospitals operating at a Sunday standard. Scores of doctors picketed the Mater, Beaumont, St Vincentâs and Connolly hospitals in Dublin and outside the capital in Cork University, Tullamore, Portiuncula and the Mercy in Cork. The doctorsâ strike followed weeks of failed negotiations with the HSE over shifts that run for more than 24 hours. Taoiseach Enda Kenny urged the striking doctors to return to the negotiating table. âI would say the place to sort it out is at the Labour Relations Commission â not across the airwaves. Thatâs a tried and tested forum,â he said. Mr Kenny said the commission can resolve the dispute. âI do hope that this will be responded to in a positive fashion and hopefully can be resolved so that, understanding that we want to get to a point at the end of next year where the working time directive is fully implemented in respect of all the doctors and all the hospitals as should be many years ago,â he said. Doctors carried out any required transplant and dialysis service and the normal weekend palliative care and attended for patients undergoing active chemotherapy and radiotherapy which cannot be deferred. They maintained they had received exceptional support from the public and medical colleagues. Mr Young added: âI think everybody has seen that the responsibility for this sad state of affairs rests with the HSE and there has been huge support for our efforts to bring an end to the routine abuse of NCHDs.â Dr John Donnellan, of the Irish Medical Organisation (IMO), blamed the Health Service Executive (HSE) for the withdrawal of services. âResponsibility for this day of action rests fairly and squarely with the HSE who have abused the position of NCHDs for over a decade,â he said. âThroughout that time they have misled doctors, they have broken promises and commitments and they have ignored their obligations under EU law. âAs a result they are presiding over an unsafe working environment where the health of patients and that of our own NCHD colleagues is routinely put at risk.Today we are saying loud and clear â enough is enough we are not taking this any more.â About 12,000 outpatient appointments were cancelled as a result and about 3,000 operations postponed as a result of the strike.

Ireland has fifth highest cancer bill per citizen of EU states Ireland has fifth highest cancer bill per citizen of EU states In-patient care accounts for 67% of Irish cancer bill â the highest proportion in EU Relatives and friends of cancer sufferers provided three billion hours of unpaid care, worth â¬23.2 billion, while lost productivity caused by illness and early death is put at â¬52 billion, according to the Lancet Oncology study. Ireland has the fifth highest cancer care bill per citizen in the EU, but the proportion of its cancer health bill that Ireland spends on treating patients in hospital is the highest in the EU, according to the first study of the financial costs of the disease. Cancer cost the EU â¬126 billion in health bills and lost productivity in 2009, with two-thirds of that total faced by just four countries: Germany, France, Italy, and the UK. Spending on cancer care varies widely in the EU: Luxembourg spends â¬184 per citizen; Germany spends â¬182, while Ireland comes fifth in the table, spending â¬139 per citizen. The proportion of the health bill spent on in-patient care also differed widely between EU states, taking up 30 per cent of the budget in Slovakia, but as much as 67 per cent in Ireland. The average across the EU was 56 per cent. âSome countries rely heavily on in-patient services to provide cancer care while others resort more to outpatient services, which are in most cases considerably less costly,â said the head of the study, Dr Luengo-Fernandez. However, the study, published today in Lancet Oncology, showed that just 40 per cent of the bill created by the disease is medical. âThe rest is incurred by patientsâ families, friends, and society overall.â Relatives and friends of sufferers provided three billion hours of unpaid care, worth â¬23.2 billion, while lost productivity caused by illness and early death is put at â¬52 billion. Research Researchers from Oxford University, Kingâs College and KHP Cancer Centre UK drew on Eurostat , World Health Organisation and national figures. Lung cancer has the highest bill, costing â¬18.8 billion, though breast cancer is the most expensive to treat, because of the cost of the drugs used. Ireland spends â¬619 million on cancer-related health costs: â¬417 million on in-patient care; â¬127 million on drugs; and just â¬32 million on primary care. In all, cancer consumes 4 per cent of total health spending in Ireland. Despite the level of detail, researchers warn the figures are conservative, since data on some costs â health screening, for one â could not be adequately collected in all states. The research would help policymakers allocate research funds and improve value for money, Dr Luengo-Fernandez said. Similar research in the past has shown that the economic bill left by cardiovascular disease in the EU is one-third higher than for cancer. However, the productivity losses caused by cancer are nearly double those caused by cardiovascular disease because so many cancer deaths occur in younger people. In 2009, cancer killed 1.24 million people in the EU. Comments are closed for this article.
Ireland wants to play fair over international tax competition, says Noonan Ireland wants to play fair over international tax competition, says Noonan Minister says Ireland must protect reputation on issue of global tax avoidance The Apple logo hangs inside the glass entrance to the Apple Store on 5th Avenue in New York City. Photograph: Mike Segar/Online News Ireland wants to play fair and âplay to winâ in relation to international competition for inward investment, the Minister for Finance, Michael Noonan , said in his budget speech. In a reference to recent controversy over the existence of an Apple subsidiary in Ireland that was not resident anywhere for tax purposes, Mr Noonan said it was Irelandâs position that there could not be âstateless Irish companiesâ in terms of tax residency. He said a measure to be contained in the Finance Bill would ensure this. The measure being proposed by Mr Noonan will address the controversy over the Irish Apple subsidiary, which was incorporated in the late 1970s, and will have little or no impact on more recently established Irish subsidiaries of global technology companies. Earlier this year US Democrat, Senator Carl Levin , said the Irish Apple subsidiary had achieved the âholy grailâ of tax avoidance by not being tax resident anywhere. He said the company had avoided huge amounts in tax as a result. The Irish government disputed evidence heard in Washington that Apple had negotiated a âspecial dealâ with the Irish government. The head of tax with EY Ireland, Kevin McLoughlin, said it was his understanding that the measure proposed by Mr Noonan would be very targetted. Until the proposed bill was published next week, it would be hard to know what options affected companies would have, he said. Under current Irish tax law, Irish registered companies that are managed and controlled from other jurisdictions, are not tax resident here. Such companies, resident here but controlled and managed from offshore locations such as Bermuda and the Cayman Islands , form part of the international tax structures of major multinationals such as Google and Microsoft . Although they may pay no corporation tax, they are not âstatelessâ in terms of tax residency and are outside the scope of the measures proposed by Mr Noonan. A spokesman for Mr Noonanâs department confirmed this was the case. Mr Noonan said it was important for Ireland to protect not just its corporation tax rate, but also its reputation in matters of international taxation. He said Ireland wanted to be part of the solution in relation to aggressive international tax planning, which was a global issue. He said the countryâs position was set out in a new tax strategy document published along with the budget. The documents states that Ireland participates constructively in international fora in relation to tax matters, and in particular with the EU and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. The latter organisation is currently involved in a project aimed at countering what it calls tax base erosion. An International Tax Charter in the Irish strategy statement commits Ireland to actively contribute to EU and OECD efforts to tackle harmful tax competition. The commitments include one towards the removal of any measure contained in national legislation which is found to be harmful. The charter also says Ireland will engage contructively and respectfully with developing countries in relation to tax matters, including the promotion of so-called âcountry by countryâ reporting. The latter is a policy whereby a multinationalâs accounts would give more information as to its activities in various countries, even if the profits from those activities flowed to a headquarters company based in a country such as Ireland. There has been much debate over recent years about developing countries not receiving any corporation tax receipts from the activities of multinationals in their jurisdictions. The strategy document says Ireland is open for business and committed to continuing to compete fairly to attract foreign direct investment. Return to results
Irelandâs recovery through a New Yorkerâs eyes Irelandâs recovery through a New Yorkerâs eyes When you consider the broader view there is every reason to be optimistic Ireland has kept thinking big, not just about the next quarter or budget, but about the next decade and generation, says Dan Doctoroff. Photographer: Aidan Crawley/Online News Dan Doctoroff There is a sign on the front of a pub in Dublinâs City Center that proclaims, âA good time is coming, be it ever so far away.â That sums up the Irish spirit pretty well: the old clichÃ© is that pessimism is simply part of being Irish; and after the past five years, itâs understandable to wonder just how far away those good times may be. If you only look at the short-term economic indicators, like GDP and unemployment, the outlook for recovery seems mixed. But when you consider the broader view - the difficult but necessary decisions Ireland has made and the countryâs core strategic advantages - there is every reason to be optimistic. Before joining Online News LP, I served as deputy mayor for economic development for the City of New York. I began that job just weeks after the cityâs most pessimistic moment in history -- the terrorist attacks of September 11th, 2001. The story of New Yorkâs physical and emotional wounds is well known; but 9/11 left us economically battered as well. Businesses and residents began to flee, tourism dried up, and huge budget deficits threatened our quality of life. We had to develop a plan - quickly - that would not only rebuild the city, but in many ways reinvent it. In doing so, we developed three core insights: Always keep investing Never stop thinking big When I reflect on the work we did to rebuild New York and the steps Ireland has taken in recent years, I canât help but see a number of similarities. In New York, our determination to keep investing through hard times allowed us to, among other things, bring the crime rate to an all-time low, implement the worldâs leading environmental sustainability plan, and diversify our economy to be less dependent on the finance sector. Irelandâs determination to keep investing in the things that really matter has allowed it to preserve your business-friendly advantage, maintain one of the worldâs most educated and talented workforces, and nurture a growing domestic tech sector. Ireland is increasingly becoming a place not just as a place for global companies to locate -- but also where Irish entrepreneurs are innovating, creating jobs and exporting ideas to the world. In New York, when we took a hard look at our strengths and weaknesses, we realized that nostalgia for the glory days of manufacturing was holding us back from developing our waterfront for decades. So we focused on building to new strengths, including film and television production, life sciences and, most recently, technology. Ireland has also shown remarkable self-awareness. A great example of this is the Global Economic Forum, in which senior business leaders of Irish descent from around the world are invited to present their views on what Ireland is doing rightâ¦and wrong. And just like we did in New York, Ireland has kept thinking big, not just about the next quarter or budget, but about the next decade and generation. Two of these decisions immediately come to mind: establishing NAMA, which fundamentally altered the trajectory of your economy and helped get markets functioning again, and rescheduling tens of billions of bank debt in February, which confounded the skeptics and showed that Ireland is willing to do what it takes to move forward. Obviously, these and other difficult decisions have been controversial, and we may not know the extent of their success for quite some time. Thatâs often true for big ideas. Itâs difficult to look beyond the short-term numbers right in front of us and give decisions time to play out, but Ireland deserves enormous credit for having the courage to make them. Even if the signs of recovery arenât fully apparent yet to the Irish people in their daily lives, the world is beginning to take notice. Financial markets are pricing Irish debt at the lowest rates in years; companies like Online News are continuing to locate in Dublin and hire more high-skilled Irish workers; people from all over the world are moving back to Ireland looking for opportunity; and investors are starting to inject capital into your real estate market. As a leading global provider of essential news and information for financial professionals, our company is constantly analysing the health and investment opportunity of various sectors, asset classes and industries. Looking at Ireland through a similar lens, itâs hard to not see it as a great long-term investment. This is a great time to start feeling good about Ireland again.

Irish near top of OECD table for smoking and drinking Irish near top of OECD table for smoking and drinking Report finds Irish have greater propensity towards obesity than people in many other countries The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Developmentâs Health at a Glance 2013 report confirms the serious impact of the recession on health spending. Photograph: Fabrizio Bensch/Online News A major overview of health in Ireland published today shows that the Irish are still near the top of the international league table for smoking and drinking and have a greater propensity towards obesity than people in many other countries. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Developmentâs Health at a Glance 2013 report confirms the serious impact of the recession on health spending which had been growing in Ireland at 7 per cent annually during the boom years between 2000 and 2009. But it fell by 6.6 per cent annually between 2009 and 2011 on a per capita basis, with only Greece experiencing a sharper fall than Ireland. The report says that the fall in Irish spending reflects the substantial reforms undertaken, including cuts to cost of health care, such as wages and pharmaceuticals. Oecd health at a glance 2013 But the report also confirms the encouraging progress made in combating serious illnesses in the last two decades. Deaths due to cancer fell by 21 per cent, ischemic heart disease by 59 per cent and cerebrovascular disease by 54 per cent between 1990 and 2011. In all three instances, the rate of decline was greater than the OECD average. And life expectancy in Ireland has increased by a full four years since 2000 to reach 80.6 today, slightly more than the OECD average of 80.1. Ireland remains more than two years behind the table-topper, Switzerland, where life expectancy is 82.8 years. Drinking Ireland still ranks badly when it comes to smoking, drinking and obesity. Out of 40 countries surveyed, only the Russian Federation, Greece and Chile have a higher proportion of adult daily smokers than Irelandâs 29 per cent. And although this represents a decline of 12 percentage points since the year 2000, the decline is much smaller than in many other countries. However, this smoking data comes from 2007 and therefore may not give a completely accurate picture of current trends. Only five countries out of 40 drink more alcohol than Ireland annually on a per capita basis. Average consumption in Ireland has increased slightly in the last 20 years, compared to the significant reductions recorded in some high-consumption European countries, including France, Austria, Portugal and Spain. .

Is the Euro crisis really over? Is the Euro crisis really over? The policy prescription for the European periphery is to deflate back to competitiveness: thatâs econospeak for cutting labour costs Ever since ECB president Mario Draghi pledged âto do whatever it takesâ to save the single currency, the all-important bond markets have been buying peripheral market government debt. Is the Euro crisis really over? Ever since ECB president Mario Draghi pledged âto do whatever it takesâ to save the single currency, the all-important bond markets have been buying peripheral market government debt, including Irish bonds. Draghiâs promise had a remarkable impact, one so strong that his words have yet to be fully tested in combat. âWhatever it takesâ remains a vague commitment but has been enough to convince speculators to back off betting that the Euro is in danger of imminent break-up. While the underlying economic situation in Greece, Spain and Italy can hardly be described in positive terms, at least it hasnât got much worse. Such are the low expectations for these countries, a mere hint of economic stabilisation, even at desperately high levels of unemployment, encourages people â Brussels based politicians mostly â to declare victory in the battle to save the Euro. Draghi has just celebrated his second anniversary in charge at the ECB. His tenure began with a baptism of fire: in December 2011 he embarked on the first in a series of moves to prop of the failing European banking system. He also quickly reversed the relatively recent rate hikes that had been implemented, bizarrely, by his predecessor. The fact that the ECB raised interest rates as the European economy was sliding deeper into recession and as its banking system was horribly close to something truly awful has received surprisingly little criticism. For all the talk about a stabilisation â or even recovery â in the Euro zone economy, the fact is that the region is now flirting with deflation. The latest inflation print of 0.7 per cent is well below the ECBâs own target and means that real interest rates are rising, tightening monetary conditions. Correspondingly (and just as damaging) the Euro has been strong. The ECB should respond to all of this â hence the speculation that another interest rate cut is in the offing â but, with rates already so low, there is little that it can do, at least in terms of orthodox policy. Much of the commentary about all of this is often written in tones of incredulity. Analysts look at the policies, observe their outcomes and profess amazement about how inept it all seems. Another interpretation is that it is actually all quite rational, at least from one perspective. The policy prescription for the European periphery is to deflate back to competitiveness: thatâs econospeak for cutting labour costs. The only way that can happen is for high unemployment to bear down on wages. It is the only (allowable) mechanism that works and it only works very slowly. Given that inflation cannot be allowed to rise in Germany, deflation in aggregate for the Euro zone is the inevitable â and quite deliberate â outcome. Thatâs key to understanding all of this: it is all totally deliberate. It is understood that it comes at a great human cost and that it still has years to run. But, to repeat, it is the official policy and is working as intended. So, as our Brussels and Frankfurt based masters congratulate themselves on a job well done, it is pointless to complain about any of this. It is equally pointless to argue that it is totally unsustainable. The hedge funds have been seen off: we hear gleeful comments to the effect that âAnglo-Saxonâ speculators never understood the primacy of European politics over economics: Europeans will bear any economic pain to keep the European project on track, to keep the Euro alive (closer to home, we need to give thanks for a rapidly rebounding UK economy). There is something quite dark about of all of this. Some time ago now, Bernard Connolly famously got fired from his job running the monetary affairs division of the European Commission for writing a book called âThe Rotten Heart of Europe: the Dirty War for Europeâs Moneyâ. The paradoxes and flaws inherent in our monetary system have been obvious for many years. People like Connolly have been correctly warning about them for many years. The political imperative of keeping the Euro show on the road transcends all other considerations. Speculators need to keep this in mind every time they feel like betting on another crisis. But, given the human cost of the political imperative, it is impossible not to believe that at least one country will, one day, say enough is enough. Oddly, given the way the politics are evolving, that country may not be a member of the Euro zone: some time in the next few years the UK will, again, have a referendum on whether or not to stay in the EU. The answer may well be the catalyst that the hedge funds have been looking for. .

Jansen suffers a further setback Jansen suffers a further setback Blackburn striker Matt Jansen faces three weeks out after surgery to treat a cartilage problem. But central defender Lorenzo Amoruso is moving closer to fitness following a knee operation. Rovers' assistant manager Mark Bowen said: "Matt had a small operation to trim knee cartilage. "It's a tiny piece of work, which should be a fairly quick recovery. Lorenzo is also jogging for the first time, along with kicking a ball." Jansen's career has been dogged by injury since a freak scooter accident two years ago. He returned to first-team action soon after Mark Hughes' appointment as Blackburn boss and marked it with a goal against Portsmouth in his first appearance of the season. Bowen added: "I'm guessing, but I reckon maybe two to three weeks before he is back in action completely." The Rovers assistant boss forecast a longer time spell for Amoruso's availability for first-team duties. Bowen said: "There's still some scar tissue present so it will be some weeks. "It's a case of see how he goes. You can't put a real time on a comeback, we'll see how he progresses." Comments are closed for this article.
Lifestyle 'governs mobile choice' Lifestyle 'governs mobile choice' Faster, better or funkier hardware alone is not going to help phone firms sell more handsets, research suggests. Instead, phone firms keen to get more out of their customers should not just be pushing the technology for its own sake. Consumers are far more interested in how handsets fit in with their lifestyle than they are in screen size, onboard memory or the chip inside, shows an in-depth study by handset maker Ericsson. "Historically in the industry there has been too much focus on using technology," said Dr Michael Bjorn, senior advisor on mobile media at Ericsson's consumer and enterprise lab. "We have to stop saying that these technologies will change their lives," he said. "We should try to speak to consumers in their own language and help them see how it fits in with what they are doing," he told the Online News News website. For the study, Ericsson interviewed 14,000 mobile phone owners on the ways they use their phone. "People's habits remain the same," said Dr Bjorn. "They just move the activity into the mobile phone as it's a much more convenient way to do it." One good example of this was diary-writing among younger people, he said. While diaries have always been popular, a mobile phone -- especially one equipped with a camera -- helps them keep it in a different form. Youngsters' use of text messages also reflects their desire to chat and keep in contact with friends and again just lets them do it in a slightly changed way. Dr Bjorn said that although consumers do what they always did but use a phone to do it, the sheer variety of what the new handset technologies make possible does gradually drive new habits and lifestyles. Ericsson's research has shown that consumers divide into different "tribes" that use phones in different ways. Dr Bjorn said groups dubbed "pioneers" and "materialists" were most interested in trying new things and were behind the start of many trends in phone use. "For instance," he said, "older people are using SMS much more than they did five years ago." This was because younger users, often the children of ageing mobile owners, encouraged older people to try it so they could keep in touch. Another factor governing the speed of change in mobile phone use was the simple speed with which new devices are bought by pioneers and materialists. Only when about 25% of people have handsets with new innovations on them, such as cameras, can consumers stop worrying that if they send a picture message the person at the other end will be able to see it. Once this significant number of users is passed, use of new innovations tends to take off. Dr Bjorn said that early reports of camera phone usage in Japan seemed to imply that the innovation was going to be a flop. However, he said, now 45% of the Japanese people Ericsson questioned use their camera phone at least once a month. In 2003 the figure was 29%. Similarly, across Europe the numbers of people taking snaps with cameras is starting to rise. In 2003 only 4% of the people in the UK took a phonecam snap at least once a month. Now the figure is 14%. Similar rises have been seen in many other European nations. Dr Bjorn said that people also used their camera phones in very different ways to film and even digital cameras. "Usage patterns for digital cameras are almost exactly replacing usage patterns for analogue cameras," he said. Digital cameras tend to be used on significant events such as weddings, holidays and birthdays. By contrast, he said, camera phones were being used much more to capture a moment and were being woven into everyday life. Return to results
Loyalty cards idea for TV addicts Loyalty cards idea for TV addicts Viewers could soon be rewarded for watching TV as loyalty cards come to a screen near you. Any household hooked up to Sky could soon be using smartcards in conjunction with their set-top boxes. Broadcasters such as Sky and ITV could offer viewers loyalty points in return for watching a particular channel or programme. Sky will activate a spare slot on set-top boxes in January, marketing magazine New Media Age reported. Sky set-top boxes have two slots. One is for the viewer's decryption card, while the other has been dormant until now. Loyalty cards have become a common addition to most wallets, as High Street brands rush to keep customers with a series of incentives offered by store cards. Now similar schemes look set to enter the highly competitive world of multi-channel TV. Viewers who stay loyal to a particular TV channel could be rewarded by free TV content or freebies from retail partners. Broadcasters aiming content at children could offer smartcards which gives membership to exclusive content and clubs. "Parents could pre-pay for some content, as a kind of TV pocket money card," said Nigel Whalley, managing director of media consultancy Decipher. Viewers could even be rewarded for watching ad breaks, with ideas such as ad bingo being touted by firms keen to make money out of the new market, said Mr Whalley. Credit cards that have been chipped could be used in set-top boxes to pay for movies, gambling and gaming. "The idea of an intelligent card in boxes offers a lot of possibilities. It will be down to the ingenuity of the content players," said Mr Whalley. For the Online News, revenue-generating activity will be of little interest but the new development may prompt changes to Freeview set-top boxes, said Mr Whalley. Currently most Freeview boxes do not have a slot which would allow viewers to use a smartcard. Some 7.4 million households have Sky boxes and Sky is hoping to increase this to 10 million by 2010. Loyalty cards could play a role in this, particularly in reducing the number of people who cancel their Sky subscriptions, said Ian Fogg, an analyst with Jupiter Research. Return to results
Man City 0-2 Man Utd Man City 0-2 Man Utd Manchester United reduced Chelsea's Premiership lead to nine points after a scrappy victory over Manchester City. Wayne Rooney met Gary Neville's cross to the near post with a low shot, which went in via a deflection off Richard Dunne, to put United ahead. Seven minutes later, the unfortunate Dunne hooked a volley over David James' head and into his own net. Steve McManaman wasted City's best chance when he shot wide from three yards in the first half. In the opening 45 minutes United had looked unlikely to earn the win they needed to maintain any chance of catching Chelsea in the title race. Their approach play was more laboured than patient and they managed to fashion just one chance - a Paul Scholes header over the bar. And City seemed to be content to sit back and try and hit their rivals on the break as the game settled into a tepid pattern. Only Shaun Wright-Phillips appeared capable of interrupting the monotony, looking lively down the right and causing Gabriel Heinze problems. Wes Brown also found Wright-Phillips to be a difficult opponent when the tricky winger embarrassed him near the touchline. Wright-Phillips' sublime skill and pace took him past Brown and he delivered a pin-point centre to the feet of McManaman. But the former Liverpool player demonstrated why he has never scored against United by side-footing the easy chance wide. John O'Shea was forced off after an earlier clash with Sylvain Distin and Cristiano Ronaldo came on to replace him. He immediately caused Ben Thatcher some discomfort and looked set to inject some much-needed pace into the United attack. Rooney was being well marshalled by Dunne - but that was all about to change. After the break, United poured forward and there was a renewed urgency about their play. And when Neville delivered a cross in a carbon copy of City's best first-half chance, Rooney showed McManaman how to do it - even if he needed the help of Dunne's leg. Worse was to come for Dunne, who had been having a fine match. On 75 minutes, he scored a horrible own goal when attempting to volley clear Rooney's cross and United seemed home and dry. However, City did fight back and Fowler missed another great chance from close range. And United keeper Roy Carroll saved well from Kiki Musampa. But United could have a had a third late on when substitute Ryan Giggs hit the post. - Manchester City boss Kevin Keegan: "We had a great chance to take the lead and the first goal was always going to be crucial. "We started off with a good tempo but then we allowed them to dictate the pace a bit too much. "But we still had four good chances, two after we'd gone 2-0 down, the one McManaman missed was very similar to the one Wayne Rooney scored from." - Manchester United boss Sir Alex Ferguson: "It wasn't our best performance of the last three months but I think we're deserved winners. "At times, especially in the first half, we didn't play with enough speed. But with (Cristiano) Ronaldo and (Ryan) Giggs on, the speed improved. "Derby games can be like that, they can be scrappy, dull, horrible and it was maybe like that."

Mater hospital nuns must stand up to bullying â as they have done before Mater hospital nuns must stand up to bullying â as they have done before Opinion: People would support the Mercy sisters financially with any legal costs The Mater: where the sisters stood up to the Black and Tans. Photograph: Bryan OâBrien Sr Eugene Nolan has written a fascinating history of the Mater hospital, Caring for the Nation, published by Gill & Macmillan. She describes tense times in 1921 when the military authorities realised wanted men were being treated at the Mater. Orders were issued that anyone suffering wounds caused by bullets, gunfire and other explosives was to be reported that day. Meanwhile, the Black and Tans had taken patients from other hospitals and shot them. The smaller Dublin hospitals agreed to comply but the Mater continued to treat all comers. The Black and Tans began to raid at unpredictable times but the Mater did not waver. It treated hundreds of wounded British soldiers returning from the first World War but would not comply with unjust orders, despite the risks. Sr Eugene, a former midwife who works in the hospitalâs nurse education centre, was interviewed this week about complying with legislation that allows for abortion in the case of suicide. She was anxious to establish that the Materâs excellent record of care for mothers and babies in difficult pregnancies would continue. She said babies who would have been terminated in Britain are cared for in the Mater and, while life-saving treatment for mothers takes place, targeting of the unborn has never taken place and never will. âFrontier of compassionâ A statement issued by the Mater board gave the opposite impression: âThe Mater hospital has carefully considered the [Protection of Life During Pregnancy] Act. The hospitalâs priority is to be at the frontier of compassion, concern and clinical care for all patients. Having regard to that duty, the hospital will comply with the law as provided for in the Act.â Are we supposed to read âall patientsâ as both mother and baby, which would preclude abortion on the grounds of suicide? If so, how can the hospital âcomply with the law as provided for in the Actâ? Even Archbishop of Dublin Diarmuid Martin, president of the Mater, does not know, as he is to âseek clarificationâ as to what the statement means. It was perhaps designed as a holding statement but it was a desperately unwise move. The Mater, like every other hospital that has ethical concerns about provisions of the Act, is facing a blustering Minister for Health, James Reilly, who says they have no right to object. No doubt there are people in the Mater saying that as it is not a maternity hospital, the staff should just keep their heads down and go on giving the best possible treatment to mother and baby. It wonât work. The boardâs statement issues a blank cheque to the Minister. While there is currently a very strong pro-life ethos in the Mater, changes in the law will very quickly undermine that as abortion becomes normalised Constitutional challenge According to some commentators, the declaration that no institution has a right to conscientious objection renders the Act vulnerable to constitutional challenge. Law lecturer Dr Mark Coen , who agrees with the Act, says: âThe fact that the pregnant woman has a constitutional right to a termination in certain circumstances does not necessarily mean that right would trump the very strong constitutional right of an institution to freedom of religion.â The weakness of the provision for protection of individual conscience already makes Ireland an outlier, where the only protection is to refer a case to someone else who will carry out an abortion. This would be abhorrent to anyone who has a human rights-based objection to abortion. Sr Eugene said that the Mercy sisters do not have the money to mount a legal challenge. She need not worry. People are queuing up to represent them pro bono, and thousands of ordinary Catholics would give generously. The sisters need to ask: what would Catherine McAuley, the gentle visionary who founded their order, do? I spent 13 years as a âMercy girlâ and I am confident she would say: âHave courage. Protect the vulnerable at all costs.â The sisters and their staff stood up to the Black and Tans. They can stand up to a few bullying, blustering politicians. Take a test case.

Microsoft among companies to announce total of 405 new jobs Microsoft among companies to announce total of 405 new jobs Positions to be created across software, communications and hospitality sectors Microsoft is one of the companies expanding, with the software group set to hire a further 95 people at its operation in Sandyford.Photograph: Cyril Byrne / THE IRISH TIMES Five companies, across a range of sectors, are set to create over 400 jobs. Software giant Microsoft will recruit a further 95 people across a variety of roles, including 35 graduate positions. The software group already employs some 1,900 people in Dublin. Cathriona Hallahan, managing director of Microsoft Ireland said: âWe are delighted that Ireland has been selected as the location for these new development roles. This investment builds on the strong development work that has been done by our team here at the European Development Centre over the past few years and deepens our development footprint in Ireland. These are important roles in two key areas of the business.â Microsoft is also hiring in the areas of online services program management, devices sales and operations planning (S&OP) as well as advertising operations and channel management at its Europe Middle East and Africa Operations Centre. In Belfast, telecoms giant BT is creating 165 jobs at a new call centre. The new BT Flex customer contact centre will provide support to other BT operations across the UK. It is the second major contact centre to be established by the group in the city. First Minister Peter Robinson said the company, which employs 2,300 people across the North, had considered other locations and its decision to re-invest was a âtestamentâ to the âpositive business environmentâ in the North. In other job news, bar and restaurant group the Wright Bar Group, which has nine venues across Dublin including in Airside Retail Park in Swords, as well as Clontarf and Malahide, will invest â¬800,000 in developing two new businesses with the creation of 100 jobs. Brandtone , the Dublin based mobile marketing group , will create 29 new jobs with an investment of â¬2.9 million, while Roscommon based communications company FCS Global, which provides communication solutions including voice, data and networking , will add 10 new jobs to its Irish operation.

Minister commits to protocol for timely âtracheostomy' discharges Minister commits to protocol for timely âtracheostomy' discharges Advocacy group meets Dr James Reilly over crisis Dr James Reilly: gave a âpersonal commitmentâ to the Tracheostomy Advocacy Group. Photograph: Cyril Byrne Minister for Health James Reilly has given a âpersonal commitmentâ to put in place a national protocol for the discharge of âtracheostomy babiesâ from hospital as soon as they are well, an advocacy group has said. The Tracheostomy Advocacy Group met Dr Reilly in Dublin yesterday, with senior HSE staff in attendance. The group had been seeking an urgent meeting with the Minister to call on him to implement a 2008 HSE protocol for these infantsâ âsafe and timely dischargeâ from hospital. The issue of babies who have had tracheostomies inserted not being able to go home from hospital once they are well reached crisis levels in recent weeks. It emerged there were seven babies in Our Ladyâs Childrenâs Hospital, Crumlin who, having had tracheostomies inserted months and even years ago, who could not go home as the HSE was refusing to sanction safe homecare packages, due to issues with funding. Homecare Babies who have had tracheotomies, whereby a tube is inserted into a hole cut into their windpipe to help them breathe, require 24-hour care, including having their tubes cleaned, changed and suctioned. Though parents are trained before their children go home, they also need homecare packages to allow them to sleep and take care of other responsibilities. A spokesman for the Minister confirmed Dr Reilly was âcommitted to a protocol being put in placeâ. Colm Young, founder of the Tracheostomy Advocacy Group, said he was âhopefulâ after the meeting that the 2008 protocol would be adopted, though he was given no time frame. âThe Minister said he was personally committed to putting in place a structure for the discharge of children from hospital, as soon as possible. âI do think weâre getting there. I am more hopeful . . . I asked for the minutes . . . to be sent on to me, because I want it in writing that the Minister has given that personal commitment. âWe agreed on this protocol, with some amendments to include ventilated children [rather than just those able to breathe unaided]. We all agreed the best place for these children is the home setting,â Mr Young said. Return to results
Minister says profitable health insurers can accept lower profits on policies for younger customers Minister says profitable health insurers can accept lower profits on policies for younger customers Minister for Health James Reilly suggested today that some health insurers were âcherry-pickingâ customers and as a result had lower proportion of older customers than their market share. Photograph: TheOnline News Minister for Health James Reilly has called on insurers to absorb the cost of stamp duty increases and not add them to the health cover premiums of younger people. Yesterday Dr Reilly announced a number of rule changes announced which, coupled with budget reductions in tax relief on premiums, are expected to see premiums increase by approximately 15 per cent. An average family with two children will pay an extra â¬328 in premiums next year as a result of yesterdayâs change and the budget cuts in tax relief, insurer GloHealth estimated. Laya healthcare added that the move would drive more people out of private health insurance. Speaking today Dr Reilly said an average of 60,000 people per annum had abandoned their private health insurance and admitted that in the longer term this was unsustainable. He called on insurers to accept a lower profit margin on their younger, healthier customers and not to pass on the increases to this age group in a bid to prevent them surrendering their policies. Dr Reilly suggested that some insurers were âcherry-pickingâ customers and as a result had a far lower proportion of older customers than their market share. Dr Reilly said VHI had only 55 per cent of the private health insurance market but 80 per cent of the payouts, largely because it had a disproportionally high proportion of elderly customers, and that this was unsustainable. He said the changes were being introduced to protect older people and keep health insurance affordable for them. Fianna FÃ¡il leader Micheal Martin told the DÃ¡il today up to 6,000 people are cancelling their private health insurance each month. âBy the end of this year, in two years alone, we estimate that about 140,000 people will have cancelled health insurance,ââ he added. He claimed that Government policies were driving people out of private health insurance. Laya managing director DÃ³nal Clancy said ârather than protect the most vulnerable patients as outlined by the Minister, the levy hike will only increase the burden on an already struggling public health systemâ. He said the health levy has risen by 149 per cent for an adult since its introduction in 2009 with the rate for children rising 155 per cent. The duty, which is used to fund credits to the various insurers according to the age profile of their customers, is being increased from â¬350 to â¬399 per adult with advanced cover, and â¬120 to â¬135 per child. The change will affect more than 80 per cent of customers who have advanced cover for private and public hospitals. The VHI will benefit most from the changes to credits because it has the highest proportion of older customers. The three privately owned insurers will be hardest hit because their customer base is younger. Dr Reilly said he was reluctant to recommend increases in stamp duty, given the pressures many households face. âHowever, my priority is to direct support where it is most needed and these revised risk equalisation credits will subsidise health insurance for our most vulnerable patients,â he said. GloHealth chief executive Jim Dowdall said: âIt is farcical, bizarre and absurd that the Minister continually calls on health insurers to drive down costs when Government policies have been the overwhelming driver of rising premiums in recent years.â Risk equalisation is the system whereby companies with older customers with higher claims costs are compensated by rivals with a younger client case. Dermot Goode of Cornmarket Healthcare Division said the changes announced by the Minister would have an inflationary effect even though the stamp duty was not levied on consumers, because insurers were likely to pass on the increases. âConsumers are going to get clobbered. Between this and the cuts in tax relief announced in last monthâs budget, itâs likely that premium increases of between 10 and 15 per cent are coming down the line,â he said. Insurances companies are also under pressure to fund an extra â¬30 million a year being demanded by the Department of Health from next year in respect of the use by private patients of public beds in the public health system, he said. Mr Goode estimated that the budget changes added up to â¬270 a year to the cost of the VHIâs Plan B Options policy, and â¬170 to Plan B. Customers on âgold-platedâ plans, as they were called by Minister for Finance Michael Noonan in his budget-day speech, will have to pay an extra â¬470-â¬780 a year. .

Mobiles rack up 20 years of use Mobiles rack up 20 years of use Mobile phones in the UK are celebrating their 20th anniversary this weekend. Britain's first mobile phone call was made across the Vodafone network on 1 January 1985 by veteran comedian Ernie Wise. In the 20 years since that day, mobile phones have become an integral part of modern life and now almost 90% of Britons own a handset. Mobiles have become so popular that many people use their handset as their only phone and rarely use a landline. The first ever call over a portable phone was made in 1973 in New York but it took 10 years for the first commercial mobile service to be launched. The UK was not far behind the rest of the world in setting up networks in 1985 that let people make calls while they walked. The first call was made from St Katherine's dock to Vodafone's head office in Newbury which at the time was over a curry house. For the first nine days of 1985 Vodafone was the only firm with a mobile network in the UK. Then on 10 January Cellnet (now O2) launched its service. Mike Caudwell, spokesman for Vodafone, said that when phones were launched they were the size of a briefcase, cost about Â£2,000 and had a battery life of little more than 20 minutes. "Despite that they were hugely popular in the mid-80s," he said. "They became a yuppy must-have and a status symbol among young wealthy business folk." This was also despite the fact that the phones used analogue radio signals to communicate which made them very easy to eavesdrop on. He said it took Vodafone almost nine years to rack up its first million customers but only 18 months to get the second million. "It's very easy to forget that in 1983 when we put the bid document in we were forecasting that the total market would be two million people," he said. "Cellnet was forecasting half that." Now Vodafone has 14m customers in the UK alone. Cellnet and Vodafone were the only mobile phone operators in the UK until 1993 when One2One (now T-Mobile) was launched. Orange had its UK launch in 1994. Both newcomers operated digital mobile networks and now all operators use this technology. The analogue spectrum for the old phones has been retired. Called Global System for Mobiles (GSM) this is now the most widely used phone technology on the planet and is used to help more than 1.2 billion people make calls. Mr Caudwell said the advent of digital technology also helped to introduce all those things, such as text messaging and roaming that have made mobiles so popular.

More movies head to Sony's PSP More movies head to Sony's PSP Movies Open Water and Saw are among those to be made available for Sony's PSP games console. Film studio Lions Gate entertainment has announced an initial list of 12 movies that will be on the UMD format used by the handheld. "The typical buyer of the machine [is] the core demographic to whom our films generally appeal," said Steve Beeks, president of Lions Gate. Already available in Japan, the PSP is released in the US on 24 March. Spider-Man 2 on UMD will be given to the first million customers in the US. The Punisher and House of the Dead along with older titles such as Total Recall and Rambo: First Blood, will be in the UMD format, with disks costing between $20 (Â£10.40) to $30 (Â£15.60) for new titles and $10 (Â£5.20) to $20 for older films. "When we first saw the machine and started talking to Sony, we immediately decided it was going to be a winner, both from the gaming perspective and from the perspective of people watching movies on the go," Mr Beeks said. The disks, which are smaller than DVDs, only work in Sony's PSP and can hold up to 1.8GB of data. "We actually believe people who buy the UMD would not have bought it on DVD," he said. "There are people who will want UMD because of the portability. Maybe they're already taking the games with them out of the house, and they're bigger gamers than they are movie watchers." Four movies have already been announced for PSP. They are: XXX, Hellboy, Resident Evil: Apocalypse and Once Upon a Time in Mexico. Comments are closed for this article.
National campaign to empower young women on thier own well-being National campaign to empower young women on thier own well-being Terri Levine, EimÃ©ar Savage and Shauna Kelly talking about young womenâs access to health services at the National Womenâs Council of Ireland offices in Parnell Square, Dublin. Photograph: Frank Miller One third of young women feel they cannot discuss sensitive health issues with their doctor while half donât know what is confidential between them and their doctor, a study published today finds. Based on a survey of 350 women aged between 17 and 25, conducted in August, the study also finds three-quarters of respondents would be reluctant to go to the doctor, hospital or other clinic because of cost, while 80 per cent would not know how to make a complaint about a doctor, nurse or hospital if they felt they had been treated badly. Youth initiative The study was conducted by the National Womenâs Council of Irelandâs youth initiative, the Y-factor, which was founded in February to give a platform to the voices of young women. As well as publishing the survey results today, the Y-factor is launching a health information and support campaign aimed specifically at young women, timed to mark the second UN international âDay of the Girlâ. There will be an online presence and a number of information events hosted by the Y-factor as part of the Your Health Matters campaign. Shauna Kelly (23), one of the founder members of the Y-factor, says a particular driver for the campaign was that young women had particular health needs and, as evidenced in the survey, many neither knew where to get information nor felt confident about their rights when accessing it. âSociety expects young women to be all-knowing, to take responsibility and yet the survey shows a lack of autonomy. A lot of young women donât feel they have the power to make their own decisions.â There is a lack of an information âbridgeâ between being a child female and an adult woman, says Terri Levine (23). âThe information needs to be accessible in a way that young women can get it without risking feeling embarrassed or silly for not knowing everything already.â Health information And young women do have particular needs for health information, says Ms Kelly. âOf course, young men have health issues, but for young women health is often seen in negative terms, as embarrassing or a crisis. Responsibility is thrust on women in a way itâs not on men, but without the information. âWe want to provide the information and encourage young women to look for it, to discuss their health and their rights and in a way that itâs not taboo and itâs not embarrassing.â Among the health issues addressed in the Y-factor leaflets and sites are eating disorders, bullying, sexual assault, and contraception.

New Year's texting breaks record New Year's texting breaks record A mobile phone was as essential to the recent New Year's festivities as a party mood and Auld Lang Syne, if the number of text messages sent is anything to go by. Between midnight on 31 December and midnight on 1 January, 133m text messages were sent in the UK. It is the highest ever daily total recorded by the Mobile Data Association (MDA). It represents an increase of 20% on last year's figures. Wishing a Happy New Year to friends and family via text message has become a staple ingredient of the year's largest party. While texting has not quite overtaken the old-fashioned phone call, it is heading that way, said Mike Short, chairman of the MDA. "In the case of a New Years Eve party, texting is useful if you are unable to speak or hear because of a noisy background," he said. There were also lots of messages sent internationally, where different time zones made traditional calls unfeasible, he said. The British love affair with texting shows no signs of abating and the annual total for 2004 is set to exceed 25bn, according to MDA. The MDA predicts that 2005 could see more than 30bn text messages sent in the UK. "We thought texting might slow down as MMS took off but we have seen no sign of that," said Mr Short. More and more firms are seeing the value in mobile marketing. Restaurants are using text messages to tell customers about special offers and promotions. Anyone in need of a bit of January cheer now the party season is over, can use a service set up by Jongleurs comedy club, which will text them a joke a day. For those still wanting to drink and be merry as the long days of winter draw in, the Good Pub Guide offers a service giving the location and address of their nearest recommended pub. Users need to text the word GOODPUB to 85130. If they want to turn the evening into a pub crawl, they simply text the word NEXT. And for those still standing at the end of the night, a taxi service in London is available via text, which will locate the nearest available black cab. Return to results
New data shows âmodernâ sector is hampering production output New data shows âmodernâ sector is hampering production output Industrial production was dragged lower by a sluggish modern sector. Photograph: Simon Dawson/Online News Irelandâs industrial production fell in August, dropping almost 7 per cent year on year and 1 per cent compared with the previous month, new data from the Central Statistics office said. The sharp fall was driven by driven by declines in the modern sector, which is dominated by pharmaceutical firms that are being hit by patent expirations, harming output. Production in the modern sector rose by 0.4 per cent on a monthly basis, but is down 11.4 per cent in the year to August. âThis volatility masks encouraging trends in the more labour-intensive âtraditionalâ sector, which is now up 3.4 per cent year-on-year in the three months to August, the fastest clip since early 2011,â said Davy Stockbrokersâ David McNamara. The traditional sector grew by 0.9 per cent month on month. Quarter on quarter, the seasonally adjusted volume of industrial production for manufacturing industries remained 2.5 per cent higher for the three months to August, the data showed. Turnover in the industrial sector rose by 2.9 per cent month on month and fell by 2.8 per cent annually. Merrion Stockbrokersâ Alan McQuaid said the figures âpainted a mixed pictureâ for the manufacturing sector. âWhatever about the near-term outlook, we still firmly believe that when the world economy regains momentum, Ireland is better placed than most to take advantage of that,â he said. âHowever, on the basis of the figures for the first eight months of the year it looks as though manufacturing output for 2013 as a whole will post a low single digit decline for the second year running.â Return to results
Nobel laureate warns of US stock market bubble Nobel laureate warns of US stock market bubble Robert Shiller shared prize for research into market prices and asset bubbles Robert Shiller: âI am most worried about the boom in the US stock market,â he told Der Spiegel magazine. Photograph: Wendy Carlson/Getty Images An American who won this yearâs Nobel prize for economics believes sharp rises in equity and property prices could lead to a dangerous financial bubble and may end badly, he told a German magazine. Robert Shiller, who won the award with two other Americans for research into market prices and asset bubbles, pinpointed the US stock market and Brazilian property market as areas of concern. âI am not yet sounding the alarm. But in many countries stock exchanges are at a high level and prices have risen sharply in some property markets,â Shiller told Sundayâs Der Spiegel magazine. âThat could end badly. I am most worried about the boom in the US stock market. Also because our economy is still weak and vulnerable,â he said, describing the financial and technology sectors as overvalued. He had also looked at âdrasticallyâ higher house prices in Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo in Brazil in the last five years. The collapse of the US housing market helped to trigger the 2008-2009 global financial crisis. âBubbles look like this. And the world is still very vulnerable to a bubble,â he said. â (Online News) Comments are closed for this article.
Noonan to meet Draghi for talks on Irelandâs bailout exit Noonan to meet Draghi for talks on Irelandâs bailout exit Minister expected to explore precautionary credit line option with ECB chief Minister for Finance Michael Noonan will meet with ECB chief Mario Draghi in Frankfurt later today. Photograph: Eric Luke/Online News Eoin Burke-Kennedy, Tim O'Brien Minister for Finance Michael Noonan is to meet European Central Bank president Mario Draghi today to discuss Irelandâs imminent exit of the EU-IMF bailout programme. Mr Noonan is expected to explore the possibility of securing a credit buffer from the troika to ease countryâs return to the capital markets. The Governmentâs adherence to the terms of its bailout and the fall in Irish bond yields place the country in a strong position to exit the programme. However, there is a belief that Ireland may need some form of assistance to execute the transition smoothly. The issue is expected to dominate discussions between Mr Noonan and Mr Draghi in Frankfurt later this afternoon. Mr Noonan is also due to meet with IMF officials later in the day. The EU Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs Olli Rehn said yesterday the decision about the amount of help Ireland will need is âultimatelyâ one for the country itself. He was speaking after a meeting with Mr Noonan at the European Parliament in Strasbourg yesterday. Mr Noonan briefed Mr Rehn on the adjustment programme and issues related to the forthcoming programme exit. Mr Noonan explained the recent budget and in particular Irelandâs plans to reduce the deficit below to 4.8 per cent in 2014, within the 5.1 per cent EDP target. He also said Ireland planned to deliver a primary balance or small surplus in 2014. In a short statement after the meeting, Mr Rehn acknowledged âthe significant progress that Ireland has made over the course of the adjustment programme and that Ireland is now in a strong position to exit the programme this yearâ. He said: âUltimately, the final decision on post-programme options is one for the Irish authorities.â Latest Economy Comments are closed for this article.
Norway upholds 'Napster' ruling Norway upholds 'Napster' ruling A Norwegian student who ran a website which linked to downloadable MP3 files has been ordered to pay compensation by the country's Supreme Court. Frank Allan Bruvik was ordered to pay 100,000 kroner (Â£8,000) to the music industry in Norway. He was a student when he set up his napster.no site, which allowed users to submit and receive links to MP3 files. Bruvik had earlier been cleared on appeal after a lower court had found for the music industry. Music industry bosses in Norway said the ruling would help build confidence in the internet as a distribution medium. Frank Allan Bruvik set up the napster.no website as part of a school project in 2001 while studying computer engineering in the Norwegian town of Lillehammer. The website was not associated with the napster.com site in the USA, which had been operating since 1999 and was already facing legal action. Bruvik's site was online between August and November 2001, and while it did not host any music, at its peak it was providing links to more than 170 free files on other servers. As well as providing links, the site allowed those visiting it to submit links that could later be accessed by other visitors. A legal complaint for copyright violation was filed by groups including Norway's performing rights society, Tono, and the Norwegian branches of Sony Music and Universal Music, who saw it as an important test of principle. A Norwegian court ruled in 2003 that Bruvik would have to pay 100,000 kroner to the music industry, but the country's Court of Appeal cleared him, saying that the copyright violation occurred when others posted the music. However, the Supreme Court stated that the music was clearly published in violation of copyright law It added that the case was decided based on the responsibility for abetting an illegal act, and that Bruvik's actions were premeditated. Norway's music industry said it was satisfied with the ruling, because showed that music piracy would not be accepted. Meanwhile, in the USA a further 717 lawsuits against people alleged to have traded copyrighted songs were filed this week by the Recording Industry Association of America. The suits, brought on behalf of the major record companies, cite the individuals for illegally distributing music via unauthorized peer-to-peer services such as KaZaa and eDonkey. As with preceding cases, the fresh action was made against so-called "John Doe" defendants, who are identified only by the codes given to their computers' internet connections. Return to results
PC photo printers challenge pros PC photo printers challenge pros Home printed pictures can be cheaper and higher quality than those from High Street developers, tests shows. A survey carried out by PC Pro magazine looked at which of 100 home photo printers offered a better deal than handing your snaps to a photo lab. The tests found that images from top PC printers kept their colour longer than professionally produced photographs. But using the wrong printer cartridge could means snaps fade in months, warned the magazine. The group test of 100 home photo printers for PCs discovered how much it costs to create images using the devices compared to online developers as well as High Street names such as Jessops, Boots and Snappy Snaps. The comprehensive test also revealed how quickly different printers produced images, the quality of the finished image and how resistant finished pictures were to smudging or water damage. It found that although some ink for printers now costs more than Â£2 per millilitre it can still be cheaper to produce prints from photographs at home than it is to send them off to a High Street store. "If you really like your photos, then it's definitely worth printing at home instead of going to the high street, but only if you choose the right printer," said Nick Ross, top tester at PC Pro. Mr Ross said that a new generation of printers produced images with brighter colours and that were less likely to fade than many High Street developers or even some professional wedding photographers. Some High Street photo shops can be the cheapest when it came to developing prints that were 6x4in, said Mr Ross, but the test revealed that images 7x5in and 8x10in in size were cheaper to produce at home. According to PC Pro, producing a print 8x10in on an Epson R800 printer using top quality paper costs Â£1.87. At Jessops the same image would cost Â£2.50 and at Snappy Snaps Â£9.99. A 10x7in snap at Boots would cost Â£4.99. "Considering how inconvenient it can be to go to the High Street and how silver-halide prints can fade in the sun, we're adamant that it's now better, cheaper and more convenient to print at home," he said. Ann Simpson, marketing manager at Snappy Snaps believes the convenience of high street printing will continue to attract customers. "Some people will want to do their own thing on their computer but the feedback to us is that customers often have to print two or three pictures at home in order to get a good one," she said. "Many people are not skilled at getting the colour, contrast and cropping right and they don't want the hassle," she added. The magazine test found that which ink consumers use determined how long their prints lasted before they started fading. It recommended avoiding so-called third-party inks not produced by printer makers because they tended to produce prints that fade the quickest. Return to results
Premier League planning Cole date Premier League planning Cole date The Premier League is attempting to find a mutually convenient date to investigate allegations Chelsea made an illegal approach for Ashley Cole. Both Chelsea and Arsenal will be asked to give evidence to a Premier League commission, but no deadline has been put on when that meeting will convene. "It's hard to put a date on it," a Premier League spokesman confirmed to Online News Sport. "It's not a formal situation where they've got so much time to respond." Arsenal and England defender Cole reportedly met Blues boss Jose Mourinho and chief executive Peter Kenyon in a London hotel 11 days ago. Chelsea have yet to officially confirm or deny the meeting, which would be in breach of Premier League rule K3. Now the Gunners have asked for an inquiry to look into claims that their player has been "tapped up". Both clubs have pledged to co-operate with the inquiry which will be conducted on a single day as opposed to being run as an ongoing evaluation. Cole is in negotiations with the Gunners over extending his current deal which ends in 2007. And his Arsenal team-mate Robert Pires has urged the England left-back to stay at Highbury. Pires told the Evening Standard: "He has been at Arsenal for ever. He is a very attacking left-back and I think he is enjoying his football because at Arsenal he plays in an offensive team. "I am not sure he will get the same pleasure at Chelsea, even though they are doing so well at the moment. "I have built a fantastic playing relationship with Ashley. "We play together so well - we could do it with our eyes shut. "But you have to respect the decision of the player. Everybody has that right." Comments are closed for this article.

Prof Ella Arensman, of the National Suicide Research Foundation, said the findings show that while many attitudes are more favourable, ongoing awareness about depression and mental health is required. Almost one in three people in Ireland say they would not vote for a politician if they knew they had been depressed, a new study shows. The research indicates that while attitudes towards mental health have become more favourable in recent times, significant numbers still feel harshly disposed towards people with mental health problems. For example, one in five (20 per cent) would not employ someone if they knew that they had been depressed. The findings are contained in a general population survey â Optimising Suicide Prevention Programmes and their Implementation in Europe â to be released later today. The survey was conducted in Ireland, Germany , Portugal and Hungary as part of a European collaborative suicide-prevention project. In Ireland the survey was conducted in Limerick and Galway among a representative sample of 1,000 people in December 2009. While a majority were open to seeking professional help, only half of the people perceived professional help as valuable. Comparing the four countries, Irish people showed the most favourable attitude toward depression, both in terms of personal and perceived stigma. After Portugal, Irish people ranked second-highest in openness to professional help when experiencing emotional problems and ranked highest in rating the value of professional help. Beliefs vs facts Other findings show many people still hold attitudes that are not supported by the majority of medical research. For example, 35 per cent agreed that people with depression are dangerous, while a further 26 per cent felt depression had no real medical evidence. Prof Ella Arensman , of the National Suicide Research Foundation , said the findings show that while many attitudes are more favourable, ongoing awareness about depression and mental health is required. âThe findings on whether respondents would vote for a politician who had depression, or employ someone with a mental health difficulty, are a sign on the wall that much more needs to be done to address stigma,â she said. Airing the issue âFor example, politicians have recently been coming out about issues like depression. I would like to encourage that. When people at senior levels speak openly about these issues, it helps reduce stigma.â Gerry Raleigh , director of the National Office for Suicide Prevention, said the findings were a reminder of how wider society needs to play its part in changing attitudes and providing support. âIt is important that people who are experiencing tough times and are distressed seek help. It is also important that we look out for people around us and support them to ask for help when we are concerned for their wellbeing,â he said. Separately, the Mental Health Commission yesterday called on authorities to invest in specialist mental health services. In a statement to mark World Mental Health Day, the commissionâs chairman, John Saunders , said mental services for older people especially needed more attention. lIf you think you need support experts advise getting an assessment by your GP or mental health professional. Groups such as Aware also provide support for people with depression. Contact 1890 303 302 or visit aware.ie Comments are closed for this article.
Progress on new internet domains Progress on new internet domains By early 2005 the net could have two new domain names. The .post and .travel net domains have been given preliminary approval by the net's administrative body. The names are just two of a total of 10 proposed domains that are being considered by the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, Icann. The other proposed names include a domain for pornography, Asia, mobile phones, an anti-spam domain and one for the Catalan language and culture. The .post domain is backed by the Universal Postal Union that wants to use it as the online marker for every type of postal service and to help co-ordinate the e-commerce efforts of national post offices. The .travel domain would be used by hotels, travel firms, airlines, tourism offices and would help such organisations distinguish themselves online. It is backed by a New York-based trade group called The Travel Partnership. Icann said its early decision on the two domains was in response to the detailed technical and commercial information the organisations behind the names had submitted. Despite this initial approval, Icann cautioned that there was no guarantee that the domains would actually go into service. At the same time Icann is considering proposals for another eight domains. One that may not win approval is a proposal to set up a .xxx domain for pornographic websites. A similar proposal has been made many times in the past. But Icann has been reluctant to approve it because of the difficulty of making pornographers sign up and use it. In 2000 Icann approved seven other new domains that have had varying degrees of success. Three of the new so-called top level domains were for specific industries or organisations such as .museum and .aero. Others such as .info and .biz were intended to be more generic. In total there are in excess of 200 domain names and the majority of these are for nations. But domains that end in the .com suffix are by far the most numerous. Return to results
Ratings agency Fitch puts countryâs AAA rating on negative watch Ratings agency Fitch puts countryâs AAA rating on negative watch Fitch Ratings warned today it could cut the sovereign credit rating of the United States from AAA citing the political brinkmanship over raising the federal debt ceiling. Photograph: Brendan McDermid/Online News Global markets were on tenterhooks today as the United States edges to the brink of a dangerous debt default which threatens the global economy. Ratings agency Fitch placed Americaâs prized triple-A rating on negative watch and said political brinkmanship risks the US being unable to pay its bills and threatens the dollar, as tomorrowâs debt deadline looms large. The FTSE 100 Index opened in negative territory today after Wall Street investors took a hammering last night, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average closing down heavily, while Asian markets also suffered. US politicians have until tomorrow to raise Americaâs $16.7 trillion (â¬12.35 trillion) debt ceiling â lifting the cap on how much it can borrow. Otherwise they risk the government of the worldâs biggest economy being unable to honour IOUs on Treasury debt, or pay staff wages or benefit payments to veterans. A US government shutdown caused by the deadlock, which has seen thousands of staff told to stay at home and closed government departments and museums, is set to enter its 16th day. US Treasury secretary Jack Lew has warned the country will only have about $30 billion of cash reserves left if politicians cannot agree to raise the debt ceiling by tomorrow. âIf we have insufficient cash on hand, it would be impossible for the United States of America to meet all of its obligations for the first time in our history,â said Mr Lew. While America would be unlikely to run out of money instantly, it would have to prioritise debt payments, such as an interest payment on its debt due on October 31st, meaning other bills could go unpaid. The deadlock has driven up the cost of US government borrowing and hurt the dollar. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has warned that a US debt default threatens to trigger a global recession. Fitch said that while it continues to believe an agreement will be reached to raise the debt ceiling and avoid a default, the delays threaten Americaâs debt rating and could trigger a downgrade. âThe political brinkmanship and reduced financing flexibility could increase the risk of a US default,â it said. Fitch added: âThe US risks being forced to incur widespread delays of payments to suppliers and employees, as well as social security payments to citizens â all of which would damage the perception of US sovereign creditworthiness and the economy. âThe prolonged negotiations over raising the debt ceiling risks undermining confidence in the role of the US dollar as the pre-eminent global reserve currency by casting doubt over the full faith and credit of the US.â Republicans and Democrats are reportedly close to an 11th-hour deal which would avoid a default, and will hold meetings today in the hope of striking an agreement to satisfy both parties. Delays have been triggered by disagreement over president Barack Obamaâs landmark healthcare insurance reforms. Craig Erlam , market analyst at currency brokerage Alpari, said: âAs it stands though, investors remain convinced that a deal will be done before tomorrowâs deadline.â But he added: âThe damage being done in Congress right now may not be instantly felt, but may be irreversible further down the line.â PA .

Real in talks over Gravesen move Real in talks over Gravesen move Real Madrid are closing in on a Â£2m deal for Everton's Thomas Gravesen after the Dane's agent travelled to Spain to hold talks about a move. John Sivabaek told Online News Sport: "I'm here to listen to what Real have to say. Nothing has been agreed, but this is a big opportunity for any player." The 28-year-old's contract expires in the summer, but Real want a quick deal. Sivabaek added: "I will be meeting Real on Wednesday. There is serious interest, but it is Everton's hands." Everton must decide whether to cash in now on the Denmark midfield man, or risk losing him for nothing in the summer. Manager David Moyes has defiantly claimed that he expects Gravesen to still be at Everton when the transfer window closes at the end of January. Moyes said: "I speak to Tommy regularly and we know where we are at. "There's been no contact. We don't want to lose him." Real Madrid general manager Arrigo Sacchi is the driving force behind the move, convincing vice-president Emilio Butragueno and new coach Wanderley Luxemburgo that Gravesen is the right man for the Bernabeu. Everton must weigh up whether it is worth taking the money on offer for Real and risk their own ambitions for European football. Gravesen has been outstanding as Everton have established themselves in the Premiership's top four this season. Return to results
Report shows similar lung cancer rates for smokers and ex-smokers Report shows similar lung cancer rates for smokers and ex-smokers Study shows good survival rates for patients diagnosed in early stages at St Jamesâs Hospital Lung cancer rates among current smoker and ex-smoker patients are similar, a new report has shown. Almost half of male lung cancer patients (45 per cent)at St Jamesâs Hospital, Dublin were ex-smokers while 44 per cent were smokers, the report shows. Less than 10 per cent had never smoked. The study is a ten year cancer audit report for St Jamesâs Hospital was published today. The report says lung is the highest volume cancer at the centre and âby far the largest treatment serviceâ at the hospital. There were 700 new cases at the hospital last year. However it shows that there are good survival rates if patients are diagnosed early. Of lung cancer patients at early stage one, almost 70 per cent are surviving at five years and 55 per cent at early stage two survive at five years, the report shows. The report says that 47 per cent of lung cancer patients are diagnosed early stage (clinical stage one or two ) and can be treated with the aim of a cure. Head of surgery Professor John Reynolds said these rates were âfantasticâ because popular perception was once someone developed lung cancer it was âhopelessâ. Prof Reynolds said many people who gave up smoking developed lung cancer. âWe do know there are many health benefits to giving up smoking....but a large number of ex-smokers here represented a very considerable amount of patients who developed lung cancer,â he said. The sooner you give them [cigarettes]up the better but the best thing is to never take them up,â Minister for Health Dr James Reilly said today. It is hoped the report will help doctors to determine survival rates for all cancer types. Prof Reynolds said that all cancer patients want to know if they can be cured and the 5-year survival rates area proxy for this. âThe audit data enables us to provide actual rather than inferred outcome for our patients,â he said. The report finds survival rates for all cancers are âconsistent with best international benchmarksâ. It finds âexcellentâ cure rates for breast, prostate and bowel cancer and improving cure rates for oesophageal and lung cancer. Survival rates measured include skin cancer 87 per cent, breast cancer 80 per cent, ovarian cancer 48 per cent, The report shows an at least 100 per cent increase in the number of patients managed over the study period for lung, oesophageal and lung cancer.There have also been increases in breast cancer patients (up 35 per cent) and colorectal cancer (45 per cent) The numbers have gone up party because the numbers of cancers have gone up and but also because St Jamesâs has been designated a centre for several cancers, Dr Susan OâReilly director of the National Cancer Control Centre said. Dr Oâ Reilly expects the incidents of cancer to increase. Unpublished data from the National Cancer Registry to 2040 shows the incidence of cancer driven by the aging population âcontinues to rise very steeply and is one of the fastest rising incidences in Europe, she said. âLifestyle issues around smoking also drive cancerous growth in this country,â she added. Minister for Health James Reilly said the heads of a bill being brought in on plain packaging today would âprotect our children from ever starting smokingâ. Dr Reilly responded to a Eurocare report published today showing people in the Republic diagnosed with some common cancers have a shorter survival time compared with the European average. He said the report shows that âin absolute numbers that cancer survival rates are improvingâ. He said there was âanecdotal year on year reports of better survival rates across a range of cancersâ.

To maintain the quality of our education, weâve had to find other ways to make up the difference in our income.â Photograph: Dara Mac DÃ³naill Educators often bristle at the thought of evaluating universities as businesses, and incorporating business models into higher education, but Trinity College Dublin provost Patrick Prendergast is different. While he is quick to point out the main function of a university is to educate, he recognises the importance of money and having a good business model. Like other businesses, TCD must also analyse revenue and expenses, allocate money appropriately and balance its books. âIt costs â¬300 million a year to run the institution. Generally speaking that cost has been rising. We have had ruthless cost-cutting throughout the organisation and, with salary cuts, we have seen a dip in the total spend of the university.â Prendergast, who was a professor of bio-engineering at the college before being elected as provost, says half of Trinityâs money comes from government, while the rest is private funding from student fees, investment income, philanthropy and alumni donations. âGovernment investment in higher education has come under more pressure due to austerity. To maintain the quality of our education, weâve had to find other ways to make up the difference in our income. Alumni fundraising and friends of the college is a big source of income, less than 10 per cent, but still important.â âFunding that comes indirectly from endowment, which is Trinityâs investment fund, would be about 2 per cent of our annual recurrent spend. It is an important objective to increase endowment income because thatâs the way to secure the future of universities around the world and Trinity is no exception.â He says the Trinity endowment is vital to the financial stability of the college, as it reduces the universityâs dependency on State funding. Fortunately, the market value of the endowment is on the rise, increasing from â¬120 million in 2008 to â¬144 million this year, achieving a total return of 11.7 per cent for the year to June 30th last. Like every business, TCD is constantly monitoring its image and branding, and, in recent months, has been carrying out a review. Prendergast says third-level institutions such as Oxford, Harvard, Yale and the Sorbonne all have global brands, but Trinity doesnât. The university is exploring tinkering with its historic logo and title, with any changes expected to be brought in before the launch of TCDâs strategic plan next year. âI personally think Trinity is a key word and a very successful name. One of the issues we face globally is that the word college often is used to mean secondary school. When we work in Asia, we have to emphasise University of Dublin as there is confusion.â Return to results
Screensaver tackles spam websites Screensaver tackles spam websites Net users are getting the chance to fight back against spam websites Internet portal Lycos has made a screensaver that endlessly requests data from sites that sell the goods and services mentioned in spam e-mail. Lycos hopes it will make the monthly bandwidth bills of spammers soar by keeping their servers running flat out. The net firm estimates that if enough people sign up and download the tool, spammers could end up paying to send out terabytes of data. "We've never really solved the big problem of spam which is that its so damn cheap and easy to do," said Malte Pollmann, spokesman for Lycos Europe. "In the past we have built up the spam filtering systems for our users," he said, "but now we are going to go one step further." "We've found a way to make it much higher cost for spammers by putting a load on their servers." By getting thousands of people to download and use the screensaver, Lycos hopes to get spamming websites constantly running at almost full capacity. Mr Pollmann said there was no intention to stop the spam websites working by subjecting them with too much data to cope with. He said the screensaver had been carefully written to ensure that the amount of traffic it generated from each user did not overload the web. "Every single user will contribute three to four megabytes per day," he said, "about one MP3 file." But, he said, if enough people sign up spamming websites could be force to pay for gigabytes of traffic every single day. Lycos did not want to use e-mail to fight back, said Mr Pollmann. "That would be fighting one bad thing with another bad thing," he said. The sites being targeted are those mentioned in spam e-mail messages and which sell the goods and services on offer. Typically these sites are different to those that used to send out spam e-mail and they typically only get a few thousand visitors per day. The list of sites that the screensaver will target is taken from real-time blacklists generated by organisations such as Spamcop. To limit the chance of mistakes being made, Lycos is using people to ensure that the sites are selling spam goods. As these sites rarely use advertising to offset hosting costs, the burden of high-bandwidth bills could make spam too expensive, said Mr Pollmann. Sites will also slow down under the weight of data requests. Early results show that response times of some sites have deteriorated by up to 85%. Users do not have to be registered users of Lycos to download and use the screensaver. While working, the screensaver shows the websites that are being bothered with requests for data. The screensaver is due to be launched across Europe on 1 December and before now has only been trialled in Sweden. Despite the soft launch, Mr Pollmann said that the screensaver had been downloaded more than 20,000 times in the last four days. "There's a huge user demand to not only filter spam day-by-day but to do something more," he said "Before now users have never had the chance to be a bit more offensive." Return to results
Sector concerned at reduction in tax relief announced in budget Sector concerned at reduction in tax relief announced in budget Minister for Health James Reilly. Changes announced in the budget will reduce the tax relief available for private health insurance. Photograph: Eric Luke/The Online News Private hospitals have warned that the Governmentâs move to reduce tax relief on private health insurance in the Budget could jeopardise jobs in the sector. Catherine Whelan , chief executive of the Independent Hospital Association of Ireland, said it saw the measure as another Government initiative which could destabilise the private health insurance market. She said the private hospital sector was concerned that the reduction in the tax relief on health insurance subscriptions could result in even more people dropping their cover. Ms Whelan said 170,000 people had already dropped out of private health insurance since the start of the economic downturn. She said there was a concern that this could jeopardise the private hospital sector which currently employed around 8,400 people. Ms Whelan said the Government had suggested that only those with âgold -platedâ health insurance would be affected by the move announced in the Budget. However she suggested that in fact virtually all subscribers would be hit. Return to results
Slimmer PlayStation triple sales Slimmer PlayStation triple sales Sony PlayStation 2's slimmer shape has proved popular with UK gamers, with 50,000 sold in its first week on sale. Sales have tripled since launch, outstripping Microsoft's Xbox, said market analysts Chart-Track. The numbers were also boosted by the release of the PS2-only game Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas. The title broke the UK sales record for video games in its first weekend of release. Latest figures suggest it has sold more than 677,000 copies. "It is obviously very, very encouraging for Sony because Microsoft briefly outsold them last week," John Houlihan, editor of Computerandvideogames.com told Online News News. "And with Halo 2 [for Xbox] out next week, it really is a head-to-head contest between them and Xbox." Although Xbox sales over the last week also climbed, PS2 sales were more than double that. The figures mean Sony is reaching the seven million barrier for UK sales of the console. Edinburgh-based developer, Rockstar, which is behind the GTA titles, has seen San Andreas pull in an estimated Â£24m in gross revenues over the weekend. In comparison, blockbuster films like Harry Potter and The Prisoner Of Azkaban took Â£11.5m in its first three days at the UK box office. The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King took nearly Â£10m over its opening weekend, although games titles are four to five times more expensive than cinema tickets. Gangster-themed GTA San Andreas is the sequel to Grand Theft Auto Vice City which previously held the record for the fastest-selling video game ever. The Xbox game Halo 2, released on 11 November in the UK, is also widely tipped to be one of the best-selling games of the year. The original title won universal acclaim in 2001, and sold more than four million copies. Mr Houlihan added that Sony had done well with the PS2, but it definitely helped that the release of San Andreas coincided with the slimline PS2 hitting the shelves. The run-up to Christmas is a huge battlefield for games consoles and titles. Microsoft's Xbox had been winning the race up until last week in sales. The sales figures also suggest that it may be a largely adult audience driving demand, since GTA San Andreas has an 18 certificate. Sony and Microsoft have both reduced console prices recently and are preparing the way for the launches of their next generation consoles in 2005. "Both have hit crucial price points at around Â£100 and that really does open up new consoles to new audience, plus the release of two really important games in terms of development are also driving those sales," said Mr Houlihan.

Smith aims to bring back respect Smith aims to bring back respect Scotland manager Walter Smith says he wants to restore the national team's respectability in world football. Smith has joined his first squad for a three-day get-together near Manchester in preference to playing a friendly. While qualification for the 2006 World Cup appears to be beyond Scotland, Smith is anxious that the remainder of the campaign should be positive. "I think we have got to try to get a bit of respectability back in whatever way we can," he said. "We will have to approach each game differently. Obviously we will have to approach the Italian game away from home in a different manner to Moldova at home. "We have to meet the challenge of each match." Smith, meeting a number of his squad for the first time, brought them together on Monday to outline his ideas for improving the nation's fortunes. He said: "I pointed out how I see the international team going forward and that was the main topic. "This is a relaxed gathering and I don't think there is a lot of doom and gloom about the squad that a lot of people think exists." A 25-man squad will spend the next three days based at the Mottram Hall hotel in Cheshire and will train at Manchester United's nearby Carrington complex. Smith will be absent for the final sessions, however, as he is due to fly out to Sardinia on Wednesday to watch Italy's friendly with Russia. Return to results
Sony PSP tipped as a 'must-have' Sony PSP tipped as a 'must-have' Sony's Playstation Portable is the top UK gadget for 2005, according to a round-up of ultimate gizmos compiled by Stuff Magazine. It beats the iPod into second place in the Top Ten Essentials list which predicts what gadget-lovers are likely to covet this year. Owning all 10 gadgets will set the gadget lover back Â£7,455. That is Â£1,000 cheaper than last year's list due to falling manufacturing costs making gadgets more affordable. Portable gadgets dominate the list, including Sharp's 902 3G mobile phone, the Pentax Optio SV digital camera and Samsung's Yepp YH-999 video jukebox. "What this year's Essentials shows is that gadgets are now cheaper, sexier and more indispensable than ever. We've got to the point where we can't live our lives without certain technology," said Adam Vaughan, editor of Stuff Essentials. The proliferation of gadgets in our homes is inexorably altering the role of the high street in our lives thinks Mr Vaughan. "Take digital cameras, who would now pay to develop an entire film of photos? Or legitimate downloads, who would travel miles to a record shop when they could download the song in minutes for 70p?" he asks. Next year will see a new set of technologies capturing the imaginations of gadget lovers, Stuff predicts. The Xbox 2, high-definition TV and MP3 mobiles will be among the list of must-haves that will dominate 2006, it says. The spring launch of the PSP in the UK is eagerly awaited by gaming fans.

Souness eyes summer move for Owen Souness eyes summer move for Owen Newcastle boss Graeme Souness is lining up a summer move for England and Real Madrid striker Michael Owen. He sees Owen as the ideal replacement for Alan Shearer, who is due to retire in the summer, although he hopes to persuade Shearer to carry on. "Michael is in the category of players who would excite the fans and we're monitoring him," he told Online News Newcastle. "He is a great centre-forward and only 25 but I don't think we're the only ones monitoring the situation at Real." Souness has also hinted he thinks Shearer may carry on despite his stated intent to retire at the end of the season. He believes the prospect of breaking Jackie Milburn's club scoring record may influence the striker's decision. Milburn scored 200 league and cup goals between 1946 and 1957, while Shearer currently has 187 goals to his name. "Without giving too much away, I am confident he will be here next season," said Souness. "I can't imagine him leaving without breaking Jackie Milburn's scoring record." Souness also revealed he tried to bring back Nolberto Solano during the January transfer window. The Peruvian international was sold to Aston Villa a year ago but in the phone-in for Online News Newcastle, Souness said tried to re-sign him, but Villa were not interested in selling. The former Rangers and Liverpool boss is also looking to bring in a number of new acquisitions once the current campaign has been completed. "I'm after three, four or five new players in the summer - we have got lots of targets," he said. "Don't think we will wait to the last day of the season to say: `Who are we going to target now?"'

Strachan turns down Pompey Strachan turns down Pompey Former Southampton manager Gordon Strachan has rejected the chance to become Portsmouth's new boss. The Scot was Pompey chairman Milan Mandaric's first choice to replace Harry Redknapp, who left Fratton Park for rivals Saints earlier in December. "I think it's a fantastic job for anybody apart from somebody who has just been the Southampton manager," Strachan told the Online News. Club director Terry Brady held initial talks with Strachan on Saturday. The former Scotland international added that joining Southampton's local rivals would not be a wise move. "It's got everything going for it but I've got too many memories of the other side and I don't want to sour those memories," he said. "Everything's right - it's 10 minutes away, there are good players there, a good set-up, a good atmosphere at the ground. "There's lots to do but it's not right for somebody who has just been the Southampton manager." Since Redknapp's departure, executive director Velimir Zajec and coach Joe Jordan have overseen first-team affairs. The duo had gone five matches unbeaten until Sunday's 1-0 defeat at home to champions Arsenal, but the club are still in a respectable 12th place in the Premiership table. Strachan left St Mary's in February, after earlier announcing his intention to take a break from the game at the end of the 2003-04 season. His previous managerial experience came at Coventry, whom he led for five years from 1996 to 2001. Return to results
Stressed doctors turn to meditation Stressed doctors turn to meditation The Royal College of Physicians of Ireland (RCPI) says a one-day seminar this week, which aims to introduce the centuries-old relaxation technique to doctors, is booked out. Stressed-out doctors are turning to meditation as a way of coping with the pressures of working in the health service. The Royal College of Physicians of Ireland (RCPI) says a one-day seminar this week, which aims to introduce the centuries-old relaxation technique to doctors, is booked out. The workshop is presented by Laurence Freeman , a Benedictine monk and one of the worldâs leading exponents of meditation and mindfulness. âGiven the current pressures and stresses in the lives of clinicians, new sources of renewal of the healing arts are needed,â says Fr Freeman, who has worked with the Dalai Lama and trained former President Mary McAleese in meditation. âMeditation is such a source, beginning at a personal, interior level that can be integrated into daily life as a simple, modest yet life-changing discipline.â Fr Freeman is in Dublin at the invitation of one of his former students, Dr Barry White , a haematologist at St Jamesâs Hospital, who says burnout is increasingly a problem in his profession.

Study finds younger people worst afflicted by unemployment, mortgage debt and negative equity up to ... Study finds younger people worst afflicted by unemployment, mortgage debt and negative equity up to 2010 Unemployment, housing and poverty: all areas where younger people have been hit harder. Arthur Beesley, Dan O'Brien Those aged under 45 have been affected âdramaticallyâ more by the property crash and recession than those 45 and over, according to a new research paper published yesterday by the Economic and Social Research Institute, a Dublin-based think tank. When comparing a range of indicators over the half-decade to 2009/2010, the report described the contrast between the fortunes of the two groups as âstrikingâ. Among the starkest contrasts between the under-45s and those over that age was how their weekly spending patterns changed. By all metrics analysed in the paper, including unemployment, mortgage arrears and negative equity, younger people have suffered far more than older groups. The author of the paper, Prof Petra Gerlach-Kristen, described the impact of the crash on younger groups as âlarge, both by international standards and in a historical comparisonâ. Regional disparity A separate report published this morning by the National Economic and Social Council makes similar findings, noting that young people have been hardest hit by the jobs crisis. It says there is a high level of regional disparity in youth unemployment. âYouth unemployment varies by county, with the highest rates in Limerick city (50 per cent), Donegal (49 per cent) and Wexford (47 per cent). It was lowest in DÃºn Laoghaire-Rathdown, at 27 per cent, followed by Fingal, Cork county, Galway city and Dublin city,â it says. The NESC, which advises the Government, says in its report on the wider social dimensions of the crisis that a succession of harsh budgets have hit double-income parents more than social welfare recipients and State pensioners. âThe changes have impacted most on families with children,â it says in reference to cutbacks in the budgets between 2008 and 2012. The losses from budgetary policy were highest for earning couples with children, at more than 11 per cent. This data takes account of cuts in public sector pay but does not embrace private sector pay cuts. âIn general, family types dependent on welfare experienced smaller losses of 2 to 7 per cent,â the report says. Commuter belt Citing work by social inclusion group Pobal, the council finds that the periphery of the Dublin commuter belt has been hardest hit by job losses, emigration and the legacy of unfinished âghostâ estates. The NESC also says traditionally deprived parts of Dublin, Cork and Limerick remain relatively deprived, with high unemployment and low levels of education. It notes that parts of rural Ireland such as Donegal and Mayo show up as very deprived and suffer from âhigh dependencyâ, as many people of working age have left to find work and there is a lack of infrastructure. The report says unemployment and the demand for local authority housing has âsubstantially increasedâ in parts of Louth, Longford, Offaly, Kildare and Roscommon. Some 22 per cent of all households are now without any work and the report says that a quarter of all children are living in jobless households. .

Suicide prevention poster campaign launched in Galway by parents of late Donal Walsh Suicide prevention poster campaign launched in Galway by parents of late Donal Walsh Donal Walsh: the parents of the Kerry teenager who died after a long illness earlier this year have initiated a new suicide prevention poster campaign for the west of Ireland. A new suicide prevention poster campaign for the west was initiated in east Galway last night by Elma and Fionbarr Walsh, parents of the Kerry teenager Donal Walsh who died after a long illness earlier this year. Donal Walsh âgave inspiration and hope to young people battling with depression and thoughts of suicideâ, the Galway East Life Support (GELS) group has said, paying tribute to his family for their support in publishing its new poster in Ballinasloe, Co Galway. Support organisations The poster lists seven organisations which offer support to people, including the Samaritans, Console and Pieta House, which has opened its new premises in Tuam, Co Galway. Sporting organisations including the GAA, FAI and IRFU, along with agriculture bodies IFA and Teagasc , have endorsed the prevention, awareness and education campaign by the east Galway group, which is chaired by Supt Gerry Roche of Ballinasloe Garda station.

Taoiseach says jobless rate will be below 10% by next election Taoiseach says jobless rate will be below 10% by next election Kenny says 7,000 jobs were being lost every month when Govt took office Taoiseach Enda Kenny has said he is confident that the unemployment rate will have dipped below 10 per cent by the time the next general election takes place in the Spring of 2016. Mr Kenny was speaking at the launch of the latest progress report on the Action Plan for Jobs 2103 which showed that 84 per cent of the 122 measures promised by Government for the third quarter this year have been completed. Mr Kenny said the continuing implementation of the plan in addition to the latest unemployment figures showed the Government was achieving its aim. âWe have a long way to travel but we are moving in the right direction,â he said. Mr Kenny contrasted the situation at the time the Government took office, where he said that 7,000 jobs were being lost every month, with todayâs figures which showed that 1,200 new jobs a week have been created over the past 12 months and the unemployment rate has fallen to 12.6 per cent. He said the Government would continue with a new plan in 2014. He and the TÃ¡naiste insisted that the plan would achieve its aim of creating 100,000 new and additional cards by 2016. âItâs the start of a relentless pursuit to create jobs. The action plan is important as all the pieces of the jigsaw fit together,â he said. Mr Gilmore said that the Government had made it clear that the action plan was not a paper exercise. âWe are creating over 1,000 jobs a week which is a good outcome,â said Mr Gilmore which said it was a sign of joined-up government. Many of the actions in the report revolve around plans and reports, or the commissioning of task reports. Some of those which have been delayed or not completed have been the biggest ones, including delayed legislation. One of the key ones has been the Bill which will merge the National Consumer Agency and the Competition Authority , which is now promised for publication by the end of the year. .

Taoiseach âannoyedâ at breaches of health pay policy Taoiseach âannoyedâ at breaches of health pay policy More than half of countryâs voluntary hospitals and health agencies breaching policy Taoiseach Enda Kenny: âAs I said on many occasions already, top-up payments that were not authorised, that were unapproved and that came from non-exchequer funding sources, that breached the public service pay agreement, have to be dealt with.â Photograph: Eric Luke/The Online News Rhona Mahony: a spokesman said private patients were the source of a â¬45,000 additional payment. Photograph: Eric Luke/The Online News Previous Image Next Image Taoiseach Enda Kenny this evening said he was annoyed at the revelations about the top-up payments to senior health service figures. More than half of the countryâs voluntary hospitals and health agencies are breaching Government pay policy by supplementing the salaries of senior executives, new figures have shown. The Taoiseach said: âAs I said on many occasions already, top-up payments that were not authorised, that were unapproved and that came from non-exchequer funding sources, that breached the public service pay agreement, have to be dealt with.â St Jamesâs Hospital chief receives â¬30,000 a year for Trinity role âOf course Iâm annoyed. Iâve made that very clear already. In all these cases thereâs a due process to be gone through of course. That process is now underway and will be dealt with effectively and comprehensively.â Mr Kenny was speaking before he addressed Young Fine Gaelâs national conference in Waterford this evening. Figures released by Minister for Health James Reilly last night indicate that 24 of the 44 voluntary State-funded organisations have told the Health Service Executive they are topping up approved rates of pay for senior staff with either public or private funds. The Department of Health has declined to identify the organisations breaching pay policy. The HSE is expected to verify the statements made by hospitals about whether they are complying with pay policy or otherwise. Dr Reilly said a further eight institutions had not yet indicated whether they are paying extra allowances to senior executives.âUntil such time as the situation in each organisation has been fully verified, none of these organisations can be deemed fully compliant,â he said. Top-up payments The Ministerâs comments came amid continuing controversy over revelations in The Online News over top-up payments made by voluntary hospitals and agencies to senior executives over and above their HSE-funded salaries. Government pay policy states that voluntary hospitals and health agencies funded under section 38 of the Health Act 2004 may not supplement approved rates of remuneration with public or private funding. However, State-funded voluntary organisations can make a business case to retain existing additional payments that are being made to senior managers. The Minister also said he has directed the HSE to investigate whether payments to senior managers in another category of healthcare organisations which receive public funds â known as section 39 bodies â are in line with Government pay policy.Employees in these bodies are not public servants and are not specifically subject to public-service pay scales. The Online News reported earlier this week that the chief executive of Our Ladyâs hospital in Crumlin was receiving an additional â¬30,000 from profits from shops on the campus. âPrivately funded allowancesâ Other details later emerged over substantial additional payments in âprivately funded allowancesâ made to senior figures in other hospitals such as the National Maternity Hospital and in the disability sector. The DÃ¡il Public Accounts Committee is to commence hearings into top-up payments next Wednesday. Taoiseach Enda Kenny said yesterday that voluntary hospitals and health agencies which did not respond to HSE inquiries about top-up income by this weekâs deadline would be asked to give a full account of their payment practices. Mr Kenny said the Government had made it clear that unapproved funding used as top- ups in breach of the public pay process had to come to an end. âClearly we will call in those who did not respond to the HSE. A report will be presented to the Minister for Health. That report will be published and this event will be dealt with comprehensively and conclusively.â Much controversy has centred on â¬45,000 that was paid to the master of the National Maternity Hospital Rhona Mahony , on top of a salary of more than â¬280,000. A spokesman for Dr Mahony said the source of this funding was for seeing private patients and her remuneration as master was in compliance with public service pay requirements.

Tax revenues almost exactly on target, while spending below expectations Tax revenues almost exactly on target, while spending below expectations Minister for Finance Michael Noonan and Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform Brendan Howlin at a press conference at the department to outline the third-quarter exchequer returns. Photograph: Frank Miller/The Online News The Government has received a timely boost ahead of this monthâs budget with the latest exchequer numbers indicating it is on course to hit its main fiscal targets for the year, and new Live Register data showing unemployment at a 3Â½-year low. Exchequer returns for the nine months of the year to the end of September showed tax revenues were almost exactly on target, while spending was running below expectations. Budgetary arithmetic The figures, which will be central to the budgetary arithmetic, showed the State took in â¬26.8 billion in taxes so far this year, up 2.9 per cent on the same period last year, and â¬4 million ahead of target. This gave rise to an exchequer deficit at the end of September of â¬7.1 billion, which was â¬4 billion lower than at the same stage in 2012. Income tax, the largest single source of revenue for the exchequer, raised â¬10.8 billion in the first nine months of the year, coming in 0.7 per cent or â¬81 million below target. The Department of Finance attributed âthis slight under-performanceâ to weaker-than-expected receipts from Deposit Interest Retention Tax (Dirt), linked to lower interest being earned on cash on deposit in banks. VAT receipts for the nine-month period totalled â¬8.4 billion, representing a shortfall of â¬165 million (or 1.9 per cent) against target, reflecting weak retail sales. However, the department said VAT receipts had picked up substantially in July and August on account of the good weather and the new seasonal pattern of car sales. VAT receipts for September were â¬1.6 billion, which was â¬80 million or 5.2 per cent ahead of the departmentâs monthly target. The shortfall in income tax and VAT was largely offset by a better-than-expected performance in corporation tax, which came in â¬239 million (10 per cent) ahead of the â¬2.4 billion target for the nine-month period. Local property tax receipts also boosted Government coffers, netting the exchequer â¬200 million so far this year, â¬80 million or 66.6 per cent ahead of target. Net voted expenditure was 2.7 per cent below target, at â¬31.6 billion, at the end of the nine-month period, and 4.9 per cent down year-on-year. âWeâre on target to meet the deficit target for 2013 of 7.5 per centâ, as required by the Stateâs bailout programme, Minister for Finance Michael Noonan said. The latest Live Register numbers, released separately yesterday, indicated the Stateâs unemployment rate fell to 13.3 per cent last month, its lowest level in more than 3Â½ years. However, experts warned the figures were being masked by high levels of emigration and the limited periods people are able to sign on. The figures showed the number of people claiming unemployment benefits dropped by 1,800 in September, the 15th successive monthly decline, bringing the overall number of claimants to 414,300 at the end of September. The unemployment rate, based on the Live Register, which includes part-time and seasonal workers as well as those on Jobseekerâs Allowance, has declined slowly but consistently since its post-crash peak of 15.1 per cent in February last year. Long-term claimants Over the past 12 months, the number on the register has dropped by 20,665. However, the number of long-term claimants â those signing on for more than a year â remains stubbornly high, accounting for 46.2 per cent of the total. In September, the number of long-term claimants was 188,881, down 2 per cent (3,897) on an annual basis. Minister for Social Protection Joan Burton said while the numbers out of work were still far too high, the Government was making âsustained and welcome progressâ. .

Text message record smashed again Text message record smashed again UK mobile owners continue to break records with their text messaging, with latest figures showing that 26 billion texts were sent in total in 2004. The figures collected by the Mobile Data Association (MDA) showed that 2.4 billion were fired off in December alone, the highest monthly total ever. That was 26% more than in December 2003. The records even surpassed the MDA's own predictions, it said. Every day 78 million messages are sent and there are no signs of a slow down. Before December's bumper text record, the previous highest monthly total was in October 2004, when 2.3 billion were sent. Text messaging is set to smash more records in 2005 too, said the MDA, with forecasts suggesting a total of 30 billion for the year. Even though mobiles are becoming increasingly sophisticated with much more multimedia applications, texting is still one of the most useful functions of mobiles. People are using SMS to do much more too. Booking cinema tickets, text voting, and news or sports text alerts are growing popular. Mobile owners have also given the chance to donate to the Disasters Emergency Committee's (DEC) Asian Tsunami fund by texting "Donate" to a simple short code number. Looking further ahead in the year, the MDA's chairman Mike Short, has predicted that more people will go online through their mobiles, estimating 15 billion WAP page impressions. Handsets with GPRS capability - an "always on" net connection - will rise to 75%, while 3G mobile ownership growing to five million by the end of 2005. These third generation mobiles offer a high-speed connection which means more data like video can be received on the phone. Globally, mobile phone sales passed 167 million in the third quarter of 2004, according to a recent report from analysts Gartner. That was 26% more than the previous year. It is predicted that there would be two billion handsets in use worldwide by the end of 2005. Comments are closed for this article.
Thompson says Gerrard should stay Thompson says Gerrard should stay Liverpool legend Phil Thompson has pleaded with Steve Gerrard to reject any overtures from Chelsea. The ex-Reds assistant boss also warned that any honours won at Chelsea would be cheapened by the bid to buy success. He told Online News Radio Five Live: "Liverpool would think about any bid made but it will all be down to Steve in the end. "But it wouldn't have that same sweet feeling at Chelsea, where it's all money-orientated and about simply buying the best." Thompson reacted sharply to some Liverpool supporters, who criticised Gerrard's performance in the Carling Cup final against Chelsea. A number of fans questioned Gerrard's commitment and sarcastically branded his own goal in Liverpool's 3-2 defeat as his first goal for Chelsea. Thompson added: "I heard those comments from so-called supporters and they were diabolical, absolutely outrageous. "Stevie carried the club last year and this year. He's always put Liverpool first." Thompson, who savoured seven title-winning seasons and two European Cup triumphs during his Anfield playing career, is confident that the lure of Champions League football will keep Gerrard at Anfield. "I hope Champions League football will beckon for Liverpool - either as winners or as finishing fourth in the Premiership - and he will commit himself. "There has been a lot of soul-searching the way things have gone lately. "I hope he's hardening to the fact he will have big decisions to make but I hope it is to the benefit of Steven Gerrard and I hope it is worthwhile for Liverpool." Return to results
Top 10 chief executives in US are paid at least $100m Top 10 chief executives in US are paid at least $100m Pay gaps within companies widen as top two earners, led by Facebookâs Mark Zuckerberg, earn billion-dollar pay cheques Mark Zuckerberg Dominic Rushe For the first time ever, the 10 highest-paid chief executives in the US all received more than $100m in compensation and two took home billion-dollar paychecks, according to a leading annual survey of executive pay. Mark Zuckerberg , Facebookâs co-founder, was the USâs highest paid boss last year, according to GMI Ratings annual poll of executive compensation, released on Tuesday. Zuckerbergâs total compensation topped $2.27bn - more than $6m a day. His base salary was $503,205 but the vast majority of his enormous payday came from exercising 60m Facebook share options when the company went public last year. Richard Kinder , CEO and chairman of energy firm Kinder Morgan had a base salary of just $1 in 2012 and received no other bonuses. But he made $1.1bn selling restricted stock. The payout follows a nearly $60m profit from stock in 2011. All told, the top 10 CEOs in this yearâs poll took home over $4.7bn between them and for the first time ever none earned less than $100m. âI have never seen anything like that,â said Greg Ruel , GMIâs senior research consultant and author of the report. âUsually we have a few CEOs at the $100m-plus level but never the entire top 10.â Overall GMIâs poll of pay and other forms of compensation for 2,259 US CEOs found an average rise of 8.47 per cent, less than the double-digit growth they have enjoyed for the past two years. But the average hides a more complex picture. This yearâs top earners far outstripped those below them by making huge fortunes cashing in share options as the stock markets bounced back. The report further illustrates the widening gap between CEO pay and that of the average worker. According to the US census bureau, median household income, adjusted for inflation, was $51,017 in 2012, broadly unchanged from 2011. Wages for the average household have fallen about 9% from an inflation-adjusted peak of $56,080 in 1999. The census figures show a sharp recovery for those at the top of the wage scale as those at the bottom continue to see falls. The average pay package of an S&P 500 CEO - the USâs top 500 companies - last year was $13.7m. For those in charge of S&P small cap companies it was $3.5m. CEO pay is growing fastest for those at the top. The average rise in compensation for CEOs of the Russell 3,000 - which represents about 98% of all public US companies - was 8.47%. For the Russell 1,000 - measuring the top 1,000 companies - it was 15.47%. Base salaries, bonuses and other forms of compensation were largely unchanged in 2012. The survey found that the outsized pay increases experienced by some CEOs came from the exercise of large blocks of stock options and the vesting of outsized restricted stock grants. âWhile stock options are intended to align the interests of senior executives with shareholders, the unintended consequence of these grants is often windfall profits that come from small share price increases,â GMI said in its report. âWith option grants numbering in the hundreds of thousands or even millions, CEOs at large companies in particular are able to profit by the millions for any positive gain over the strike price of their options. Furthermore, as Mark Zuckerberg showed when he sold $1bn worth of stock at Facebookâs IPO, these paper profits can quickly be converted into cash through stock sales.â Of the top 10 earners in 2012 all received the majority of their compensation for the year from share schemes. One executive, George Maffei , appeared twice in the top 10. Maffei received total compensation worth $254.8m as CEO of Liberty Media Corporation and another $136.4m as CEO of sister company Liberty Interactive . Maffei profited more than $250m on the exercise of 3.1m options at Liberty Media Corporation in 2012. As head of Liberty Interactive, Maffei exercised an additional 12.3m options for a profit of more than $132m. Comments are closed for this article.
UK gets official virus alert site UK gets official virus alert site A rapid alerting service that tells home computer users about serious internet security problems is being launched by the UK government. The service, IT Safe, will issue warnings about damaging viruses, software vulnerabilities and weaknesses on devices such as mobile phones. Alerts tell people how the threats affect them and what they can do to avoid trouble and protect themselves. The service will be free and those who sign up can get e-mail or text alerts. The scheme is aimed at home users and small businesses. The government estimates it will issue security alerts about six to 10 times a year, based on previous experience of virus outbreaks. "There is a clear need for easy-to-understand and simple independent advice for non-technically minded people who use computers either at home or at work," said Home Office Minister Hazel Blears. "The purpose of this new government service is to ensure computer users are aware of the risks involved and how to deal with them easily and effectively without causing alarm." Those signing up will only be told about the most serious security threats that have the potential to affect millions of people. Full-time staff are being employed to comb through the many hundreds of alerts issued each year by computer security firms to spot which ones have the potential to catch out a large number of people Between alerts the service will occasionally send messages giving people advice about safe ways to use their computers and phones. "IT Safe will take our technical expertise and use it to help home users understand the risks and keep their computer systems, mobile phones and a range of related consumer electronic items, safe," said Roger Cumming, director of the National Infrastructure Security Coordination Centre (NISCC). The NISCC, which is running the service, also stressed that those signing up would still need to use anti-virus software, firewalls, and software updates to stay secure. Warnings about security problems will tell people what the problem is, how it affects them and what they can do to avoid trouble. Alerts will not be issued unless users can do something to protect themselves against the threat. This might include downloading an update from an anti-virus vendor or updating software to close loopholes and fix vulnerabilities. However no software patches or programs will actually be dispensed through the site. The alerts will tell people how to go about getting hold of patches from security firms. The NISCC spokesman said the site and alerting service would stay in existence for as long as there were security bugs on home computers and other gadgets. Government statistics show that more than half of all UK households own a home computer. It was estimated that almost 13 million of these were able to access the internet in 2004. The launch comes as the number of viruses and other malicious programs in existence is reaching unprecedented numbers. In September 2004, the number of malicious programs circulating topped the 100,000 mark. Some fear that this figure could hit 150,000 by September 2005. The creation of the national alert service follows similar efforts in the Netherlands and US. The National Alerting Service for the Netherlands (aka De Waarschuwingsdienst) and the US National Cyber Alerting Service also tell citizens of serious security threats.

US industrial output falls on utilities, mining US industrial output falls on utilities, mining But third month of gains in manufacturing suggests economy remains on growth path Manufacturing output increased 0.3 per cent in October. US industrial production unexpectedly fell in October as output at power plants and mines declined, but a third straight month of gains in manufacturing suggested the economy remained on a moderate growth path. Industrial output slipped 0.1 per cent last month after advancing 0.7 per cent in September, the Federal Reserve said today. The drop in October was the first since July. Economists polled by Online News had expected industrial production to gain 0.2 per cent. Manufacturing output increased 0.3 per cent even as automobile assembly fell for the first time since July. Manufacturing output, which had edged up 0.1 per cent in September, was supported by gains in the production of primary metals, furniture and computer and electronic products among others. The sector is regaining some momentum after hitting a soft patch early in the year. Utilities output fell 1.1 per cent last month after surging 4.5 per cent in September. Mining production contracted 1.6 per cent in October, the first drop in seven months. The Fed attributed the fall to temporary shutdowns of oil and gas rigs in the Gulf of Mexico as Tropical Storm Karen approached. Last month, the amount of industrial capacity in use fell 0.2 percentage point to 78.1 per cent. Industrial capacity utilisation - a measure of how fully firms are using their resources - was 2.1 percentage points below its long-run average. Officials at the Fed tend to look at utilisation measures as a signal of how much âslackâ remains in the economy, and how much room growth has to run before it becomes inflationary.

Van Nistelrooy set to return Van Nistelrooy set to return Manchester United striker Ruud van Nistelrooy may make his comeback after an Achilles tendon injury in the FA Cup fifth round tie at Everton on Saturday. He has been out of action for nearly three months and had targeted a return in the Champions League tie with AC Milan on 23 February. But Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson hinted he may be back early. He said: "There is a chance he could be involved at Everton but we'll just have to see how he comes through training." The 28-year-old has been training in Holland and Ferguson said: "Ruud comes back on Tuesday and we need to assess how far on he is. "The training he has been doing in Holland has been perfect and I am very satisfied with it." Even without Van Nistelrooy, United made it 13 wins in 15 league games with a 2-0 derby victory at Manchester City on Sunday. But they will be boosted by the return of the Dutch international, who is the club's top scorer this season with 12 goals. He has not played since aggravating the injury in the 3-0 win against West Brom on 27 November. Ferguson was unhappy with Van Nistelrooy for not revealing he was carrying an injury. United have also been hit by injuries to both Alan Smith and Louis Saha during Van Nistelrooy's absence, meaning Wayne Rooney has sometimes had to play in a lone role up front. The teenager has responded with six goals in nine games, including the first goal against City on Sunday. Comments are closed for this article.
Voters flock to blog awards site Voters flock to blog awards site Voting is under way for the annual Bloggies which recognise the best web blogs - online spaces where people publish their thoughts - of the year. Nominations were announced on Sunday, but traffic to the official site was so heavy that the website was temporarily closed because of too many visitors. Weblogs have been nominated in 30 categories, from the top regional blog, to the best-kept-secret blog. Blogs had a huge year, with a top US dictionary naming "blog" word of 2004. Technorati, a blog search engine, tracks about six million blogs and says that more than 12,000 are added daily. A blog is created every 5.8 seconds, according to US research think-tank Pew Internet and American Life, but less than 40% of the total are updated at least once every two months. Nikolai Nolan, who has run the Bloggies for the past five years, told the Online News News website he was not too surprised by the amount of voters who crowded the site. "The awards always get a lot of traffic; this was just my first year on a server with a bandwidth limit, so I had to guess how much I'd need," he said. There were many new finalists this year, he added, and a few that had won Bloggies before. Several entries reflected specific news events. "There are four nominations for the South-East Asia Earthquake and Tsunami Blog, which is a pretty timely one for 2005," said Mr Nolan. The big Bloggies battle will be for the ultimate prize of blog of the year. The nominated blogs are wide-ranging covering what is in the news to quirky sites of interest. Fighting it out for the coveted award are Gawker, This Fish Needs a Bicycle, Wonkette, Boing Boing, and Gothamist. In a sign that blogs are playing an increasingly key part in spreading news and current affairs, The South-East Asia Earthquake and Tsunami Blog is also nominated in the best overall category. GreenFairyDotcom, Londonist, Hicksdesign, PlasticBag and London Underground Tube Blog are the nominees in the best British or Irish weblog. Included in the other categories is best "meme". This is for the top "replicating idea that spread about weblogs". Nominations include Flickr, a web photo album which lets people upload, tag, share and publish their images to blogs. Podcasting has also made an appearance in the category. It is an increasingly popular idea that makes use of RSS (really simple syndication) and audio technology to let people easily make their own radio shows, and distribute them automatically onto portable devices. Many are done by those who already have text-based blogs, so they are almost like audio blogs. Three new categories have been added to the list this year, including best food, best entertainment, and best writing of a weblog. One of the categories that was scrapped though was best music blog. The winners of the fifth annual Bloggies are chosen by the public. Public voting closes on 3 February and the winners will be announced sometime between 13 and 15 March.

Web radio takes Spanish rap global Web radio takes Spanish rap global Spin the radio dial in the US and you are likely to find plenty of Spanish-language music. But what you will not find is much Spanish-language hip-hop. Hip-hop and rap are actually quite popular in the Spanish-speaking world, but local artists are having trouble marketing their work abroad. But now, a US company is bringing rap and hip-hop en espanol to computer users everywhere. Los Caballeros de Plan G are one of Mexico's hottest hip-hop acts. They have a devoted fan base in their native Monterrey. But most Mexican hip-hop fans, not to mention fans in most of the Spanish-speaking world, rarely get a chance to hear the group's tracks on the radio. "You can't really just go on the radio and listen to hip-hop in Spanish... it's just not accessible," says Manuel Millan, a native of San Diego, California. "It's really hard for the Spanish hip-hop scene to get into mainstream radio. You usually have a very commercialised sound and the groups are not really known around the country or around the world." Millan and two friends set out to change that - they wanted to make groups like Los Caballeros de Plan G accessible to fans globally. Mainstream radio stations were not going to play this kind of music, and starting their own broadcast station was economically impossible. So, Millan and his friends launched a website called latinohiphopradio.com. The name says it all: it is web-based radio, devoted to the hottest Spanish language rap and hip-hop tracks. The site, which is in both in English and Spanish, is meant to be easy to navigate. All the user has to do is download a media player. There are no DJs. It is just music streamed over the net for free. Suddenly, with the help of the website, Los Caballeros de Plan G are producing "export quality" rap. The web might be just the right medium for Spanish language hip-hop right now. The genre is in what Millan calls its "infant stage". But the production values are improving, and artists such as Argentina's Mustafa Yoda are pushing to make it better and better. Mustafa Yoda is currently one of the hottest tracks on latinohiphopradio.com. "He's considered the Eminem of Argentina, and the Latin American hip-hop scene," Millan says. "He really hasn't had that much exposure as far as anywhere in the world, but he's definitely the one to look out for as far as becoming the next big thing in the Spanish-speaking world." Currently, the Chilean group Makisa is also in latinohiphopradio.com's top 10, as is Cuban artist Papo Record. "Every country's got it's own cultural differences and they try to put those into their own songs," Millan says. Latinohiphopradio.com has been up and running for a couple of months now. The site has listeners from across the Spanish speaking world. Right now, Mexico leads the way, accounting for about 50% of listeners. But web surfers in Spain are logging in as well - about 25% of the web station's traffic comes from there. That is not surprising as many consider Spain to be the leader in Spanish-language rap and hip-hop. Millan says that Spain is actually just behind the United States and France in terms of overall rap and hip-hop production. That might be changing, though, as more and more Latin American artists are finding audiences. But one Spaniard is still firmly in latinohiphopradio.com's top 10. His name is Tote King and Manuel Millan says that he is the hip-hop leader in Spain. On his track Uno Contra Veinte Emcees, or One Against 20 Emcees, Tote King shows he is well aware of that fact. "It's basically him bragging that he's one of the best emcees in Spain right now," Millan says. "And it's pretty much true. He has the tightest productions, and his rap flow is impeccable, it's amazing." Latinohiphopradio.com is hoping to expand in the coming year. Millan says they want to include more music and more news from the world of Spanish language hip-hop and rap.

Weir poised for Sunderland move Weir poised for Sunderland move Larne's teenage star Robbie Weir is poised to join Sunderland after turning down a move to Stoke City. The 17-year-old Irish League midfielder was also being chased by Rangers and Fulham, but Mick McCarthy's side appear to have won the race. But Larne boss Jimmy McGeough has yet to confirm that Weir is on his way from Inver Park. "I heard on Sunday that he has joined Sunderland, but not from the lad himself," he said. ''Robbie has an agreement with Larne that he can negotiate with interested clubs. ''Personally, I would rather see him making an impact at local level to build up his physique before moving into the full-time game. ''He has been on trial with a number of clubs. But it would be great to see him making it at Sunderland.'' Comments are closed for this article.
What high-definition will do to DVDs What high-definition will do to DVDs First it was the humble home video, then it was the DVD, and now Hollywood is preparing for the next revolution in home entertainment - high-definition. High-definition gives incredible, 3D-like pictures and surround sound. The DVD disks and the gear to play them will not be out for another year or so, and there at are still a number of issues to be sorted out. But when high-definition films do come out on the new format DVDs, it will profoundly change home entertainment. For Rick Dean, director of business development for digital content company THX, a high-definition future is an exciting prospect. He has worked on the Star Wars DVD trilogy, Finding Nemo, The Incredibles and Indiana Jones. "There was a time not so long ago when the film world and the video world were two completely separate worlds," he told the Online News News website. "The technology we are dealing with now means they are very much conjoined. "The film that we see in theatres is coming from the same digital file that we take the home video master," he says. But currently, putting a master feature film onto DVD requires severe compression because current DVD technology cannot hold as much as high-definition films demand. "As much as you compress the picture data rate wise, you also take qualities away from the picture that we fight so hard to keep in the master," he explains. "I would love to be able to show people what projects that we worked on really look like in the high-def world and I find it very exciting." High-definition DVDs can hold up to six times more data than the DVDs we are used to. It will take time though to persuade people who spent money on DVD players to buy the different players and displays required to watch high-definition DVDs in 18 months' time. Mr Dean is confident though: "I think if they see real HD [high-definition], not some heavily compressed version of it, there is such a remarkable difference. "I have heard comments from people who say the images pop off the screen." High-definition will mean some changes for those working behind the scenes too. On the whole, producing films for high-definition DVDs will be easier in some ways because less compression is needed. Equally, it may mean Hollywood studios ask for more to be put onto the average DVD. "When we master movies right now, our data rates are running at about 1.2 gigabits per second," says Mr Dean. "Our DVDs that we put out today have to be squashed down to about five or six megabits per second. "That's a huge amount of compression that has to be applied - about 98%. So if you have anything that allows more space, you don't have to compress so hard." Studios could fit a lot more marketing material, games, and features, onto high-capacity DVDs. Currently, an entire DVD project can take up to three months, says Mr Dean. Although the step of down-converting will be bypassed, this will realistically only save a day's work, says Mr Dean. One of the most time consuming elements is building DVD navigation and menu systems. On the fairly complex Star Wars disks, making sure the menu buttons worked took 45 human hours alone. If studios want to cash in on the extra space, it could mean extra human hours, for which someone has to pay. "If the decision on the studio side is that they are going to put a lot more on these disks, it could be more expensive because of all the extra navigation that is required." And if studios do focus on delivering more "added value content", thinks Mr Dean, ultimately it could mean that they will want more money for it. Those costs could filter down to the price ticket on a high-definition DVD. But if the consumer is not willing to pay a premium price, studios will listen, thinks Mr Dean. High-definition throws up other challenge to film makers and DVD production alike. More clarity on screen means film makers have to make doubly sure that attention to detail is meticulous. "When we did the first HD version of Star Wars Episode I, everybody was very sun-tanned, but that was make-up. "In the HD version of Episode I, all these make-up lines showed up," explains Mr Dean. The restoration of the older Star Wars episodes revealed some interesting items too. "There are scans of a corridor [on the Death Star] and fairly plainly in one of those shots, there is a file cabinet stuck behind one of the doorways. "You never used to be able to see it because things are just blurred enough during the pan that you just didn't see it." What high-definition revolution ultimately means is that the line between home entertainment and cinema worlds will blur. With home theatre systems turning living rooms into cinemas, this line blurs even further. It could also mean that how we get films, and in what format, will widen. "In the future we are going to look towards file delivery over IP [internet protocol - broadband], giving a DVD-like experience from the set-top box to the hard drive," says Mr Dean. But that is some time off for most, and for now, people still like to show off something physical in their bookshelves. Return to results
What price for 'trusted PC security'? What price for 'trusted PC security'? You can now buy "trusted computers", but can we really trust the PC vendors, asks technology analyst Bill Thompson. If you have recently bought an IBM ThinkVantage computer, a Dell Optiplex, or one of a whole range of laptops from Toshiba, HP/Compaq or Samsung then you may have got more for your money than you realised. Inside your shiny new PC is an extra chip called the trusted platform module (TPM) that can be used for a range of hardware-based security features. Eventually the TPM will be built into the main processor itself, and if the trusted computing group has its way then you will find one in every piece of hardware you own, from mobile phones to TV set top boxes to children's toys. But for the moment it is a separate piece of hardware, providing enhanced security features to programs that know how to use them. And as part of a well-designed network system, it can provide a lot more security than we enjoy today. A big advantage of the TPM is that it is hardware-based. At the moment most of us rely on software to keep our information safe and secure. It might be password-protected user accounts, data encryption programs or a firewall, but it all relies on program code running on an inherently insecure processor. Hardware security is less common, even if it is a lot safer. This is partly because it is more expensive to give someone a smartcard than a password, but also because its more work for users, systems administrators and managers. As a result we settle for second best. So when it comes to computer security, trusted systems could be a major step forward. After all, if you have a laptop that will only run programs that have been digitally signed then it will be a lot harder for virus writers to get their malicious code to run. And if all your files are locked automatically then even if you get your computer stolen your personal data will be safeguarded. At the moment support for trusted hardware is not built into major operating systems. Instead you have to use special software, like HP's ProtectTools or Wave Systems' Embassy. This provides file encryption, password management and identity protection, usually for business users who connect to company networks. Full support for the trusted computing specification will not be available from Microsoft until the next release of Windows, "Longhorn". This will include what Microsoft, in a typical act of obscurantism, calls the "Next Generation Secure Computing Base", and it will give user-level programs access to the trusted computing hardware. When that happens we can expect to see a lot of publicity around the new capabilities, and no doubt the Windows security centre will encourage users to turn on their trusted computing capability just as they turn on their firewall. However there is a downside to the increased security from viruses, spyware and data theft that this will provide. Because the trusted computing base is also used to make digital rights management (DRM) systems more secure, this will give content providers a lot more control over what we can do with music, movies and books that we have bought from them. We have seen recently how allowing digital rights management services into our lives can lead to unwelcome consequences. Users of Apple's iTunes used to be able to stream the music they had brought to up to five other iTunes users, a great way of letting your mates discover your music collection. But the latest version of iTunes limits this capability, just as an earlier upgrade reduced the number of times you could burn a selected playlist of purchased songs to a CD. Another took away the ability to play songs downloaded from Real's Harmony service on your iPod. Apple can do this because they wrote the software and they control the rights management. Once it is embedded in trusted hardware it will be even harder for dedicated programmers to find their way around these restrictions and give us back the fair use rights that should be guaranteed under copyright law. Similarly, users of TiVo digital video recorders have found that they cannot record some shows, and other programmes that they have recorded are automatically deleted after a day. This happens because of changes that TiVo have made to their software, and the users cannot control it. One wonders whether hardware-based DRM will work for those who believe that locking-down digital content is a bad idea, and that the flexibility of copyright law is something that should be embraced and not taken away. It will not work because of the fundamental flaw at the heart of the system: in order for the purchaser to view the content it has to be unlocked. Once it is unlocked then someone, somewhere, will figure out a way to make a copy of the unlocked version. And once an unlocked version leaks onto the network it will be uncontrollable. The efforts going into DRM would be much better spent building efficient distribution services, finding business models that are based on trusting your customers, and offering high quality downloads at fair prices. What we want is not so much a trusted computing platform as a trusted customer platform. The record companies and the film industry need to recognise that most of us, most of the time, will pay a reasonable amount for good quality material. They will benefit more by building a market in which I can share songs with my friends, record shows I want to watch later, and burn CDs for my kids; a market which respects the spirit of copyright law and does not seek to replace it by restrictive contracts or end user agreements. We need to ensure that trusted computing remains under the control of the users and is not used to take away the freedoms we enjoy today.

What the papers said What the papers said The New York Times focused on possible moves to curb tax avoidance by multinationals. Photograph: Oli Scarff/Getty Images Much of the international coverage of the budget focused on Minister for Finance Michael Noonanâs pledge to tackle the use of stateless Irish companies by US multinationals to lower their taxes .

Wolves appoint Hoddle as manager Wolves appoint Hoddle as manager Glenn Hoddle has been unveiled as the new Wolves manager. The ex-England coach has been given a six-month contract to succeed Dave Jones, who was sacked after the club's poor start to the season. Wolves chairman Rick Hayward said: "We're delighted Glenn is here. He has a six-month contract so we can test each other out and see if it works." Hoddle, who will work alongside Stuart Gray, has been out of the game since he was sacked by Spurs in 2003. Gray, who has been caretaker manager, was assistant boss when Hoddle was manager at Southampton. "I'm delighted to be here," said Hoddle. "I saw the massive potential that Wolves have got and their desire and amibition to get back into the Premiership parallels my ambitions. "Stuart Gray has done a fantastic job as caretaker manager. We've worked together at Southampton and I'm delighted to be back with him." Wolves chief executive Jez Moxey defended the decision to give Hoddle a short-term contract. "We hope it will work out for both parties and we extend it for the long term," he said. "Most managers want a four-year contract and then expect it to be paid off if it doesn't work out. "For somebody of Glenn's calibre to come in on a short-term contract and put his reputation on the line, it demonstrates his commitment and self-belief and the potential he thinks is here." Hayward revealed that Hoddle was one of the first to be approached after Jones' departure. "He was not available at the time because he was looking at various other things," he explained. "Five weeks later we're back on track and this a tremendous opportunity for Wolves." Hoddle began his managerial career as player-boss with Swindon before moving on to Chelsea and then taking up the England job. His spell in charge of the national side came to an end after the 1998 World Cup when he made controversial remarks about the disabled in a newspaper interview. The 47-year-old later returned to management with Southampton, where he again succeeded Jones - as he has now done at Wolves. He engineered an upturn in Saints' fortunes before being lured to White Hart Lane by Tottenham - the club where he made his name as a player. That relationship turned sour at the start of the last campaign and he left the London club early last season. Since then he has applied unsuccessfully for the post of France manager and had also been linked with a return to Southampton. Wolves are currently 17th in the Championship and have a home game against Millwall on Tuesday. Return to results
Alcohol is not a solution in which we should expect problems to dissolve Alcohol is not a solution in which we should expect problems to dissolve Opinion: We can learn much from the accounts of people who have survived attempts to kill themselves Alcohol is a poor resource in helping us to cope with stress or unhappiness. Indeed, far from drowning our sorrows, it may âteach them how to swimâ. Photograph: PA Bobby Smyth There has been much debate and discussion in Ireland recently about intoxicating substances and our relationship with them. In the past few days attention has centred on cannabis but in previous weeks the focus was very much on our nationâs favourite drug: alcohol. Even during the debate on cannabis, alcohol was never far from the discussion. The pro-cannabis lobby groups were keen to tell us that their drug wasnât really any worse than our legal drug. I am unsure about their strategy of drawing links to drink at a time when our society appears to be on the cusp of facing up to the huge damage that alcohol inflicts upon us. It would be a bit like someone coming up to your house at your party and asking to be let in by arguing that they were not quite as bad as the roaring, violent, window-smashing nutcase you let in earlier. Like most western societies, we have sought to regulate the alcohol market. Recent history has taught us that regulation, in a general sense, is not one of our talents here in Ireland. Certainly our generation has failed rather miserably in its efforts to keep alcohol out of the hands of children. The age of first drinking has crept downwards in the past few decades, with the average child now drinking at about 14 or 15 years of age. There is now good evidence that people who start to drink alcohol in mid-adolescence are at increased risk of alcohol dependence when they reach adulthood. Survey From the recent My World survey of young people aged 12-24 years we know that drinking patterns among our youth are very concerning. That survey reported that half of all Leaving Cert students were drinking in a problematic manner. By the early 20s the proportion with problem drinking was more than 60 per cent. The survey also confirmed the link between drinking and mental health problems. The more young people drink, the more likely they are to have anxiety and depression symptoms. Last month, an Irish government accepted for the first time in recent history that something needed to be done about our drink problem. The Government outlined a range of measures intended to reduce the carnage from its current level of about 1,100 deaths a year. The alcohol-related deaths among our youth are particularly tragic. These deaths fall into two broad categories. First there are the drunken incidents in which people take risks driving, swimming, climbing or crossing roads. The reluctance of journalists to report the role of alcohol in individual deaths is particularly unfortunate as it conceals from the public the extent and frequency of these avoidable catastrophes. The second major group of alcohol- related deaths in our youth is suicides. The majority of young men who take their own lives are intoxicated at the time. While we may choose to believe that people take alcohol in order to complete the act of suicide this is rarely the case. .

Apple attacked over sources row Apple attacked over sources row Civil liberties group the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) has joined a legal fight between three US online journalists and Apple. Apple wants the reporters to reveal 20 sources used for stories which leaked information about forthcoming products, including the Mac Mini. The EFF, representing the reporters, has asked California's Superior court to stop Apple pursuing the sources. It argues that the journalists are protected by the American constitution. The EFF says the case threatens the basic freedoms of the press. Apple is particularly keen to find the source for information about an unreleased product code-named Asteroid and has asked the journalists' e-mail providers to hand over communications relevant to that. "Rather than confronting the issue of reporter's privilege head-on, Apple is going to the journalist's ISPs for his e-mails," said EFF lawyer Kurt Opsahl. "This undermines a fundamental First Amendment right that protects all reporters. "If the court lets Apple get away with this, and exposes the confidences gained by these reporters, potential confidential sources will be deterred from providing information to the media and the public will lose a vital outlet for independent news, analysis and commentary," he said. The case began in December 2004 when Apple asked a local Californian court to get the journalists to reveal their sources for articles published on websites AppleInsider.com and PowerPage.org. Apple also sent requested information from the Nfox.com, the internet service provider of PowerPage's publisher Jason O-Grady. As well as looking at how far corporations can go in preventing information from being published, the case will also examine whether online journalists have the same privileges and protections as those writing for newspapers and magazines. The EFF has gained some powerful allies in its legal battle with Apple, including Professor Tom Goldstein, former dean of the Journalism School at the University of California and Dan Gillmor, a well-known Silicon Valley journalist. Apple was not immediately available for comment. Comments are closed for this article.
Apple unveils low-cost 'Mac mini' Apple unveils low-cost 'Mac mini' Apple has unveiled a new, low-cost Macintosh computer for the masses, billed as the Mac mini. Chief executive Steve Jobs showed off the new machine at his annual MacWorld speech, in San Francisco. The $499 Macintosh, sold for Â£339 in the UK, was described by Jobs as the "most important Mac" made by Apple. Mr Jobs also unveiled the iPod shuffle, a new music player using cheaper flash memory rather than hard drives, which are used in more expensive iPods. The new computer shifts the company into new territory - traditionally, the firm is known as a design and innovation-led firm rather than as a mass-market manufacturer. The Mac mini comes without a monitor, keyboard and mouse, and a second version with a larger hard drive will also be sold for $599. The machine - which will be available from 22 January - was described by Jobs as "BYODKM... bring your own display, keyboard, and mouse". In an attempt to win over Windows PC customers, Mr Jobs said it would appeal to people thinking of changing operating systems. "People who are thinking of switching will have no more excuses," he said. "It's the newest and most affordable Mac ever." The new computer has been the subject of speculation for several weeks and while few people will be surprised by the announcement many analysts had already said it was a sensible move. In January, Apple sued a website after it published what it said were specifications for the new computer. Ian Harris, deputy editor of UK magazine Mac Format, said the machine would appeal to PC-owning consumers who had purchased an iPod. "They want a further taste of Mac because they like what they have seen with iPod." Harris added: "Everybody thought that Apple was happy to remain a niche maker of luxury computers, and moving into a market dominated by low margin manufacturers like Dell is a bold move. "But it shows that Apple is keen to capitalise on the mass market success it's had with the iPod. The Mac mini will appeal to PC users looking for an attractive, 'no fuss' computer." The new iPod shuffle comes in two versions - one offering 512mb of storage for $99 (Â£69 in the Uk) and a second with one gigabyte of storage for $149 (Â£99) - and went on sale Tuesday. The music player has no display and will play songs either consecutively or shuffled. The smaller iPod will hold about 120 songs, said Mr Jobs. Mr Jobs told the delegates at MacWorld that iPod already had a 65% market share of all digital music players. Return to results
Australia leaves interest rate at record low of 2.5 per cent Australia leaves interest rate at record low of 2.5 per cent House prices in countryâs biggest cities rose 8% in year to November Prices in Sydney surged 14 per cent in the 11 months to November 30th to a record A$724,628 (Â¤487,000). Images Australiaâs central bank left its benchmark interest rate unchanged at a record low and said the currency is âstill uncomfortably high,â even after a 4.6 per cent decline since its previous meeting. Governor Glenn Stevens and his board kept the overnight cash-rate target at 2.5 per cent, the Reserve Bank of Australia said in a statement today in Sydney, as predicted by all 30 economists surveyed. Maintaining the same language as a month earlier, he said a lower Aussie âis likely to be needed to achieve balanced growth in the economy.â Markets and economists predict the central bank will leave rates unchanged next year to avoid a growth gap emerging as mining companies plan fewer projects. Low borrowing costs are driving up home prices, suggesting the RBA may be reluctant to add to its 2.25 percentage points of rate cuts since late 2011. âThe hurdle to cut further is high with the RBA clearly reluctant to take the cash rate lower and hoping for further currency weakness to help in the rebalancing challenge,â said Su-Lin Ong, head of Australian economic and fixed-income strategy at Royal Bank of Canada in Sydney. âThe RBA appears happy to sit on the sidelines and monitor data and developments with the next board meeting not until February.â The Australian dollar declined, trading at 90.66 US cents at 4.15pm in Sydney, compared with 90.90 cents prior to the release. The RBA lowered borrowing costs eight times from November 2011 to August 2013. âFull effectsâ âThe full effects of these decisions are still coming through, and will be for a while yet,â Mr Stevens said today in a statement that mirrored last monthâs release. âThe pace of borrowing has remained relatively subdued overall to date, though recently there have been signs of increased demand for finance by households.â The average home price in Australiaâs biggest cities rose 8 per cent in November from a year earlier, the biggest annual gain since the year ended October 31st, 2010, to an all-time high of A$606,003 (â¬407,000), according to the RP Data-Rismark home value index. Prices in Sydney surged 14 per cent in the 11 months to November 30th to a record A$724,628. Government data today showed retail sales expanded a faster-than-forecast 0.5 per cent in October from a month earlier, when the figure was revised higher to 0.9 per cent. âNear the bottomâ âRates are at or near the bottom of the cycle, but rate hikes are probably quite some way off,â said Craig James , a senior economist at a unit of Commonwealth Bank of Australia, in Sydney. âIf the economy continues to gather momentum, inflation remains under control and the Aussie dollar remains near US 90 cents or eases further, then the Reserve Bank can happily stay on the interest-rate sidelines.â Even so, Treasuryâs top economic forecaster David Gruen said last month Australia should brace for the weakest income growth in half a century in the coming 10 years.

Aviva announces 5.2% rise in its health insurance plans Aviva announces 5.2% rise in its health insurance plans Price increases across range of plans will be effective from the beginning of next year Health insurance with Aviva will cost thousands of families more than â¬ 120 more each year after the company announced premium price increases of an average of 5.2 per cent this morning. Health insurance with Aviva will cost thousands of families more than â¬ 120 more each year after the company announced premium price increases of an average of 5.2 per cent this morning. The price increases across a range of its plans will be effective from the beginning of next year and come just days after Glo Health announced similar increases on its policies. Aviva said it regretted that it has had to impose its latest increase blaming the impact of recent changes in Government policy on public hospital bed charges and the increase in the cost of claims which, it said, had been driven upwards by âthe shift in the age composition of our customer baseâ. Last Friday evening, the Government informed health insurers of its decision not to reduce the rates set out in legislation passed by the Oireachtas last July which allows privately insured patients to be charged for the use of a public bed in a public hospital. This means that from the beginning of January, patients with private health insurance will be charged up to â¬ 813 per night when they occupy a public bed in a public hospital. The current charge is â¬ 75 per night. Aviva said the new charge âdirectly increases the cost of providing cover for our membersâ. Its chief executive Alison Burns claimed the company was âdeeply conscious of the struggle our customers face to maintain their health coverâ and she said it had taken the decision not to increase the price of some of its entry level plans. âThose due to renew in January and February already face premium increases as a result of the governmentâs decision to reduce tax relief. With this in mind, we have held our increase to the absolute minimum of an average of 5.2 per cent.â She added that Aviva would have to keep premium prices under review over the coming months. âRecent government policy changes have severely disrupted the health insurance market and their impact on customer behaviour remains to be seen. Our first obligation as a responsible regulated insurer is to make sure we are in a position to pay the claims of our customers when they get sick,â she stressed. .

BT boosts its broadband packages BT boosts its broadband packages British Telecom has said it will double the broadband speeds of most of its home and business customers. The increased speeds will come at no extra charge and follows a similar move by internet service provider AOL. Many BT customers will now have download speeds of 2Mbps, although there are usage allowances of between one gigabyte and 30 gigabytes a month. The new speeds start to come into effect on 17 February for home customers and 1 April for businesses. "Britain is now broadband Britain," said Duncan Ingram, BT's managing director, broadband and internet services. He added: "Ninety percent of our customers will see real increases in speed. "These speed increases will give people the opportunity to do a lot more with their broadband connections," he said. Upload speeds - the speed at which information is sent from a PC via broadband - will remain at the same speed, said Mr Ingram. Despite the increases, BT will continue to have usage allowances for home customers. "The allowances are extremely generous," said Mr Ingram "For what we are seeing in the market place - they are really not an issue." BT will begin enforcing the allowances in the summer. Customers who exceed the amounts will either be able to pay for a bigger allowance or see their download speeds reduced. BT now has a 36% share of the broadband market - down from 39% - which is becoming increasingly competitive. In the last few months, many rival ISPs have begun to offer 2Mbps services, including AOL, Plusnet and UK Online. But Britain continues to lag behind some countries - especially Japan and South Korea - which offer broadband speeds of up to 40Mbps. But Mr Ingram said it was important to "separate hype from reality". He said that a limited number of people with those connections consistently received speeds of 40Mbps. Customers will not see their connections double immediately on 17 February. Mr Ingram said there would be a roll out across the network in order to prevent any problems.

Beckham defends form for England Beckham defends form for England England captain David Beckham insists he is not concerned by criticism of his displays for club and country. "As long as I'm happy with my form for Real Madrid and England, whatever anybody else says doesn't really matter," said Beckham. "The most important thing for me is that I'm comfortable with the way I'm playing - I must admit, the last month has been my best month for a while. "There are a lot of important games coming up, for Real and for England." The midfielder feels that new coach Wanderley Luxemburgo's arrival at Madrid has lifted the Spanish giants. "Since the turn of the year, it's been exciting because we've got a new manager in, and we're playing more attractive football than we had been over the last few months," Beckham explained. "He's totally changed things around - I think we're working a lot harder in training and we're more organised in games. "That's shown in the games we've played under him - even the six-minute game, which was a great start for him. "It's pushed the players on a little bit, and given us more confidence, which is great for any team. I'm looking forward to 2005 - we're seven points behind Barcelona but things are looking up for us. "In any season, I want to win as many trophies as possible, play the best football I can, and stay healthy and fit - that's all I can ask." Looking ahead to next week's first England game of 2005, Beckham is keen to test his form on the international stage. "It's important to be involved in games like this - it's a tough game against Holland, even though it's a friendly," he said. "It's always nice to play in England games, but it's important to have friendlies, as it's good to get prepared for the qualifiers which are coming up. "It's important for the team which starts the qualifying games to play together as much as possible, but the manager can also try younger players out." Beckham has also been gripped by the excitement of the Premiership title race this season. "There aren't many leagues like it around the world - it's so exciting and intense, and the top three or four clubs are really close," he said. "Chelsea seem to be running away with it a little bit, but Manchester United keep winning, and no-one can forget what Arsenal can do on the pitch, so it's going to be interesting. "There's plenty of talent in the Chelsea team, the Arsenal team - but the player who always catches the eye for me is Thierry Henry - he's a great player and a really good person. "John Terry and Frank Lampard have been exceptional for Chelsea, and they're a big part of why Chelsea are doing so well this year." Return to results
Benitez deflects blame from Dudek Benitez deflects blame from Dudek Liverpool manager Rafael Benitez has refused to point the finger of blame at goalkeeper Jerzy Dudek after Portsmouth claimed a draw at Anfield. Dudek fumbled a cross before Lomana LuaLua headed home an injury-time equaliser, levelling after Steven Gerrard put Liverpool ahead. Benitez said: "It was difficult for Jerzy. It was an unlucky moment. "He was expecting a cross from Matthew Taylor and it ended up like a shot, so I don't blame him for what happened." Benitez admitted it was a costly loss of two points by Liverpool, who followed up their derby defeat against Everton with a disappointing draw. He said: "We had many opportunities but didn't score and, in the end, a 1-0 lead was not enough. "If you don't have any chances you have to think of other things, but when you are creating so many chances as we are there is nothing you can say to the players. It was a pity. "We lost two points, but we have one more point in the table. Now we have another difficult game against Newcastle and we have to recover quickly from that." Comments are closed for this article.
Board member hopes controversy around top-up payments will not impact on fundraising Board member hopes controversy around top-up payments will not impact on fundraising The audit found that Our Ladyâs Hospital, Crumlin, was one of 13 agencies collectively paying about â¬900,000 to senior managers in top-up payments and benefits from non-State sources. A board member of the Stateâs largest childrenâs hospital, Our Ladyâs in Crumlin, has said the Health Service Executive salary scale for chief executives is not appropriate and needs to be changed. Cllr Ruairi McGinley, who sits on the board of Our Ladyâs Childrenâs Hospital and St Jamesâs Hospital Dublin, also said he would be dismayed if the controversy around top-up payments for senior executives impacted on fundraising. According to Department of Health files the chief executive of Our Ladyâs Hospital, Lorcan Birthistle , was receiving total remuneration of â¬140,808 of which â¬30,000 was described as a âprivately funded allowanceâ. The income stream used to fund this allowance is generated from profits from shops on the hospital campus. âIn terms of the commercial revenue being used to top it up to a reasonable rate, and a reasonable rate is a rate that would have applied to other CEOs of Dublin hospitals, I donât have an issue with that myself,â he told RTÃâs Morning Ireland . He described the HSEâs salary scale as inappropriate. âMy first point of call would be to change the HSEâs scale, but my second point would be to make a business case that says the current salary is justified.â Mr McGinley said he was certain ââ¬110,000 is not an appropriate salary for a chief executive of a national childrenâs hospital.â He said no one in the public service should earn more than the Taoiseachâs salary of â¬185,000 and added that the salary of the chief executive at Crumlin hospital was at was âat the lowest end of any of the numbers that have appearedâ. Mr McGinley said he hoped the publicity around top-up payments would not negatively impact on fundraising. âThe salaries have been approved by the board, it is a limited company we do have responsibilities totally separate to the Minister,â he said. Mr McGinley said he would not support trying to recoup top up payments paid to the chief executive. He added that the board would not have dealt with the chief executiveâs salary and said it would have been appointed before his term on the board. âThe issue I would have is people in the public service earning more than the Taoiseach salary at â¬185,000 and I would reduce all salaries above this level.â Details of the payment emerged in confidential Department of Health files obtained by The Online News which set out publicly for the first time the total amount, including top-up payments, made to individual members of senior management across State-funded voluntary hospitals and health agencies. .

Board of West/North-West Hospitals group says individuals will be referred to Medical Council âif ap... Board of West/North-West Hospitals group says individuals will be referred to Medical Council âif appropriateâ The board of the HSE West/North West Hospital Group has ordered a review of the actions of staff members who treated Savita Halappanavar (above) at University Hospital Galway. The board of the West/North-West Hospitals group is to start a review of the actions of all staff members involved in the care of Savita Halappanavar after her admission to University Hospital Galway last year. It said that if appropriate, individuals will be referred by the board to the Irish Medical Council (IMC) and the Nursing and Midwifery board, the boardâs chairman Bill Maher has said. The two existing reports by the HSE, Health and Information Quality Authority (HIQA) and the coronerâs inquest transcripts and findings would also be referred to these two regulatory bodies, he said. Mr Maher says the board is already âco-operating fullyâ with preliminary hearings in some instances which are already being held by the two bodies. Last weekâs HIQA report into Ms Halappanavarâs death, after she was admitted to University Hospital Galway while 17 weeksâ pregnant and miscarrying, identified 13 âmissed opportunitiesâ which, had they been identified and acted upon by the hospital, âmay potentially have resulted in a different outcome for herâ. Todayâs statement from Mr Maher follows a special hospital board meeting last night at University Hospital Galway to review the HSE, HIQA and coronerâs inquest reports. Its âreviewâ of actions of all staff members involved in Ms Halappanavarâs care would âtake account of, inter aliaâ these three investigations, and âas part of due process, the staff will have full opportunity to explain their decisions and actions,â Mr Maher said. âWe will take all appropriate action in light of these proceedings. I believe that in many instances there will be no case to answer,â he said. âPatient safety is paramount for us all in the West/ North West Hospitals Group and we are determined that we will learn from these three investigations and that we will take all action necessary to ensure the safety and welfare of all pregnant women and all other patients attending not just University Hospital Galway, but all the other six hospitals in our newly established group,â he said. Board chairman Noel Daly had placed on record at last nightâs board meeting an an apology to Mr Halappanavar and his family for âthe events related to his wifeâs care that contributed to her tragic death,â Mr Maher said. Mr Maher said âconsiderable progressâ had been made in implementing the recommendations from the HSE investigation and the coronerâs inquest. These include the implementation of early warning scoring systems; the education of all staff in the recognition, monitoring and management of sepsis and septic shock; the introduction of a new multi-disciplinary team-based training programme in the management of obstetric emergencies, including sepsis; the completion of specialist bereavement counselling training for key staff in the maternity unit; and improved communications procedures for doctorsâ handovers. âWe will now also implement the HIQA recommendations and the board asked that they be given a detailed update on progress at each board meeting,â Mr Maher said. âThey also asked for an external review after 12 months of the implementation of the recommendations and, in the interests of full transparency, to make available the report from this audit at a public board meeting. âThe board emphasised that we should continue to apply all of the recommendations across the group and not just in University Hospital Galway,â he said. âMany of the recommendations will have resource implications and the board has asked that we quantify these and advance discussions with the HSE and the Department of Health to ensure they can be implemented without delay,â he said. âNo member of staff came to work during Mrs Halappanavarâs care or any other day to do harm,â Mr Maher said. â However, the death of Mrs Halappanavar had a devastating effect not just on her husband, family and friends but also on many people working at UHG. It also had a devastating effect on the trust that our patients have in our services,â he said. The hospital boardâs own governance structures, cross-committee membership and board composition, which had been criticised by HIQA, would also be reviewed, he said, and the board would âengageâ with HIQA on this. âI think people will understand that I am constrained in any further comments not just because of the ongoing IMC and NMBI enquiries, and our own disciplinary procedures that are about to start, but also that we need to be mindful that Mr Halappanavar has initiated civil proceedings against University Hospital Galway and a named consultant at the hospital,â Mr Maher said.

Broadband in the UK growing fast Broadband in the UK growing fast High-speed net connections in the UK are proving more popular than ever. BT reports that more people signed up for broadband in the last three months than in any other quarter. The 600,000 connections take the total number of people in the UK signing up for broadband from BT to almost 3.3 million. Nationally more than 5 million browse the net via broadband. Britain now has among the highest number of broadband connections throughout the whole of Europe. According to figures gathered by industry watchdog, Ofcom, the growth means that the UK has now surpassed Germany in terms of broadband users per 100 people. The UK total of 5.3 million translates into 7.5 connections per 100 people, compared to 6.7 in Germany and 15.8 in the Netherlands. The numbers of people signing up to broadband include those that get their service direct from BT or via the many companies that re-sell BT lines under their own name. Part of the surge in people signing up was due to BT stretching the reach of ADSL - the UK's most widely used way of getting broadband - beyond 6km. Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line technology lets ordinary copper phone lines support high data speeds. The standard speed is 512kbps, though faster connections are available. "This breakthrough led to a dramatic increase in orders as we were suddenly able to satisfy the pent-up demand that existed in many areas," said Paul Reynolds, chief executive of BT Wholesale which provides phone lines that other firms re-sell. BT Retail, which sells net services under its own name, also had a good quarter and provided about 30% of the new broadband customers. This was a slight increase on the previous three months. Despite the good news about growth in broadband, figures from telecommunications regulator Ofcom show that BT faces increasing competition, and dwindling influence, in other sectors. Local Loop Unbundling, (LLU), in which BT rivals install their hardware in exchanges and take over the line to a customer's home or office, is growing steadily. Cable & Wireless and NTL have announced that they are investing millions to start offering LLU services. By the end of September more than 4.2 million phone lines were using so-called Carrier Pre-Section (CPS) services, such as TalkTalk and One.Tel, which route phone calls across non-BT networks from a local exchange. There are now more than 300 different firms offering CPS services and the percentage of people using BT lines for voice calls has shrunk to 55.4%. Return to results
Cable offers video-on-demand Cable offers video-on-demand Cable firms NTL and Telewest have both launched video-on-demand services as the battle between satellite and cable TV heats up. Movies from Sony Pictures, Walt Disney, Touchstone, Miramax, Columbia and Buena Vista will be among those on offer. The service is similar to Sky Plus, as users can pause, fast forward and rewind content, but they cannot store programmes on their set top box - yet. It could sound the death knell for some TV channels, Telewest predicts. "It allows us to demonstrate a clear competitive advantage over Sky for the first time in many years," said Telewest chief executive Eric Tveter. "Video-on-demand will offer a deeper range of content than currently exists on TV. There will be less compromising around the TV schedule and some of the less popular channels may go by the wayside," said Philip Snalune, director of products at Telewest. Telewest customers in Bristol and NTL viewers in Glasgow will be the first to test the new service, which sees a raft of movies on offer for 24 hour rental. During the year, the service will be extended to all cable regions. Films will range in price from Â£1 or Â£2 for archived movies to Â£3.50 for current releases. New releases initially on offer will include 50 First dates, Kill Bill: Volume 2, Gothika and The Station Agent. In addition, NTL is offering children's programmes, adult content, music video and concerts. Telewest will launch similar services later in the year. NTL is also offering viewers the chance to catch up with programmes they have missed. Its pick of the week service will offer a selection of Online News programmes from the previous seven days such as Eastenders, Casualty, Top Gear and Antiques Roadshow. The Online News is trialling a similar service, offering broadband users the chance to watch programmes already broadcast on their PC. For Telewest it is the beginning of a Â£20m investment in TV-on-demand which will also see the launch of a personal video recorder (PVR). PVR has been a big success for Sky because it gives customers control over programmes. Satellite customers without PVR cannot pause, rewind or fast forward their programmes. With both services on offer from Telewest, Mr Tveter is confident the cable firm can dent not just the viewing figures for terrestrial TV but also gain a huge competitive advantage over Sky. "We offer the best of both worlds and most households have an interest in having both video-on-demand and PVR," he said. Video rental stores may also have to watch their back. "Video-on-demand is better than having a video-store in your living room and is more convenient," he said. NTL said it had not ruled out the possibility of offering a PVR but for the moment is concentrating on video-on-demand. "PVR is a recording mechanism whereas what we are offering is truly on demand," said a spokesman for the company. Video-on-demand has the added advantage of not requiring a separate set-top box or extra remote controls, he added. Adam Thomas, an analyst at research firm Informa Media believes the time is ripe for video-on-demand to flourish. "While Sky will remain the dominant force in UK pay TV for some time to come, NTL and Telewest seem well placed to successfully ride this second wave of VOD enthusiasm and, if marketed correctly, this could help them eat into Sky's lead," he said.

Call for Mexican companies to invest in Ireland Call for Mexican companies to invest in Ireland President Michael D Higgins says there is scope for further trade and investment between Ireland and Mexico President Michael D Higgins pictured with President Enrique Pena Nieto, President of Mexico at the Palacio Nacional in Mexico City yesterday, on the second day of the Presidentâs 12 day official visit to Mexico, El Salvador and Costa Rica. Mr Higgins told his Mexican counterpart that the two countries âcan further boost trade and investmentâ between them. President Michael D Higgins urged Mexican companies to consider reciprocating investments by Irish companies in Mexico and join US, European and Asian companies by investing in Ireland. Speaking at a business breakfast in Mexico City, Mr Higgins said that Irish companies had taken âa foothold in this important and vibrant market of Mexicoâ but that they could do more. âSignificant opportunities remain for Irish businesses in Mexico. We also believe that there is unexplored potential in Ireland for Mexican businesses,â he said at the Enterprise Ireland-hosted event. âI very much hope that more Irish and Mexican companies take up the reciprocal opportunities that exist to achieve mutual benefit for both countries.â The President said that he had spoken to his counterpart, Mexican president Enrique PeÃ±a Nieto, about how the two countries âcan further boost trade and investment between Ireland and Mexico.â Irish companies such as Glanbia , Kerry Group , Randox Laboratories and Irelandia Investments , the investment vehicle of the Ryan family, founders of low-cost airline Ryanair , have invested in Mexico, Irelandâs 19th largest trading partnership which represents more than â¬ 1 billion worth of trade. âOur trade in services with Mexico last year was less than 10 per cent of our merchandise trade. There is clearly scope for more of our exports, and our expertise, to engage with Mexican markets and business partners,â said Mr Higgins. âWe want to support Irish companies in further growing their partnerships in Mexico and to encourage more companies to explore the Mexican market.â The Lord Mayor of Dublin will host a seminar for Mexican businesses interested in exploring investment opportunities in Ireland. Speaking in Spanish, the President said: âI am convinced that there are significant opportunities for increased engagement, for follow up and for the crafting of an ever more dynamic and creative relationship. I look forward to flourishing relations in the years ahead.â About 20 Irish companies are accompanying the President on his Mexican trip, part of a 12-day visit to Latin America, that includes stops in El Salvador and Costa Rica. Five Irish universities are also travelling with Mr Higgins to develop partnerships with Mexican third-level institutions in areas ranging from nanotechnology and sustainable water management, to business administration and electronic engineering. âThere is room for many more partnerships of this sort,â he said. Mr Higgins told his audience of Irish and Mexican businesses that Ireland had gone through âa significant economic and social upheaval over the last few years. âThe global financial crisis of 2008 together with the collapse of our domestic banking sector, the fruit of both a credit lending and property boom, led our country into a long and painful recession,â he said. The president said that the Government was working hard to ârebalance our national economy,â noting that export growth was âa key driverâ of the economic recovery. Irish exports to Mexico grew by 24 per cent in 2012 and âhave continued to perform well above most of our other markets throughout 2013,â he said. The business breakfast was attended by Mexicoâs minister of the economy Ildefonso Guajardo Villarreal and the Minister of State for Foreign Affairs and Trade Joe Costello . Mr Guajardo Villareal said Mexico wanted to develop âa new and more intense relationship with Europeâ and called for the North America Free Trade Agreement between Canada, the US and Mexico to be integrated with the transatlantic agreement that the US and the European Union are negotiating. President Higgins will address the Mexican Business Summit, known as the Davos of Latin America, later today, delivering the keynote address of his four-day visit to Mexico. He will be the first European head of state or government to speak at the flagship conference. Latest Economy Comments are closed for this article.
Can Smith work Scottish wonders? Can Smith work Scottish wonders? The worst kept secret in Scottish football was revealed on Thursday when Walter Smith was named as the new national manager. From the moment Berti Vogts' miserable tenure in charge of Scotland ended, the former Rangers and Everton boss has been the overwhelming favourite for the post. But is Smith the man for what must be one of the hardest jobs in football? The 56-year-old takes over at a time when the national side is in the doldrums. Scotland have not reached a major finals since the World Cup in 1998 and reaching Germany 2006 looks near impossible, having picked up just two points from the opening three games in the qualifying race. And the Fifa rankings see Scotland listed at an all time low of 77th, below the likes of Estonia, Ghana, Angola and Thailand. Scotland are not blessed with quality players with experience at the top level, so Smith will have to get the best out of meagre resources. Smith's track record make impressive reading and he is widely respected within the game. The man who was Alex Ferguson's assistant when Scotland played at the 1986 World Cup won seven league titles with Rangers. And his appointment has been widely endorsed by many of the games' top names, including Ferguson and Graeme Souness, who took him to Ibrox as his assistant in 1986. Characters like Souness, Ferguson and current Ibrox manager Alex McLeish all cite Smith's experience and his expansive knowledge of the Scottish game. Much was made of Vogts' inability to express himself to the players and media. That will certainly not be the case with Smith. The former Dundee United and Dumbarton full-back is from the managerial old school - straight talking and never slow to let players know when he expects better (often with the use of some colourful invective). But it should be remembered Vogts came to Scotland with an impressive curriculum vitae - a World Cup winner as a player and a European Championships winner as a manager. Smith will inherit the same problems Vogts had - a callow squad of players with no exceptional talents. And it remains to be seen if Smith will experience the rash of call-offs that blighted so much of Vogts' preparation work. A fresh start for the Scottish national team was imperative and Smith is widely regarded as a safe pair of hands. But will a safe pair of hands be enough when the adroit hands of a magician might be required... Return to results
Cantillon: IMF bites âDouble Irish Dutch Sandwichâ Cantillon: IMF bites âDouble Irish Dutch Sandwichâ The sandwich, says the report, is a device âpopularly associated with Googleâ The latest IMF Fiscal Monitor Report draws attention to what it calls the âbrokenâ international taxation framework and, in the course of its review of the topic, has a box outlining the âtricks of the tradeâ used by multinationals to avoid paying the level of tax that most governments would like to see them pay. Among the tricks cited, the so-called âDouble Irish Dutch Sandwichâ tops the menu. The sandwich, says the report, is a device âpopularly associated with Googleâ, before going on to paint a picture of a US multinational that has sales in the UK, which are made from Ireland and then, by way of the sandwich, moving the profits onwards from Ireland to a âstill-lower-tax jurisdictionâ. (In the case of Google , the jurisdiction is Bermuda, which has no corporation tax at all.) In order to stop the US authorities deciding to tax the offshore company, (which would hold patent rights licensed to the Irish subsidiary), a second subsidiary (X) is created in Ireland. This company is managed by the offshore company and if the structure is properly arranged, the US authorities will treat the two Irish companies as one for tax purposes, while Ireland will treat the second Irish company (X) as being based offshore for tax purposes. The profits flow from the first to the second Irish subsidiary, but in order to get the money to the offshore location without encountering a withholding tax, a conduit company is set up in the Netherlands. There is no withholding tax on transfers between Ireland and the Netherlands, as they are both in the EU, and the Netherlands has no withholding tax, the document explains. While the amount being lost to the US exchequer by way of multinational tax avoidance may be as high as $60 billion each year, according to the report, in the case of some developing countries, the sums lost can be as high as 20 per cent of all tax revenue. The report says that the chance to review international tax architecture seems to come about once a century and that the fundamental issues to be confronted âshould not be duckedâ.

Chelsea clinch cup in extra-time Chelsea clinch cup in extra-time (after extra-time - score at 90 mins 1-1) John Arne Riise volleyed Liverpool ahead after 45 seconds but Steven Gerrard scored a 79th-minute own goal. Blues boss Jose Mourinho was sent off for taunting Liverpool fans after the goal and he watched on television as his side went on to win the game. Drogba and Kezman scored from close range before Antonio Nunez's header made for a tense finale. It was an amazing climax which gave Mourinho his first silverware as Chelsea manager. Yet it was controversial too, after Mourinho's sending off, apparently for putting his finger to his lips to hush the Liverpool fans. There was no hushing them after the extraordinary opening in which the Reds took a stunning lead inside the first minute. Riise could not have connected any better with Morientes' cross as he smashed a left-foot volley past Petr Cech. The goal, the quickest-ever in a League Cup final, stunned a Blues side whose previously rock-solid confidence had been shaken by consecutive losses to Newcastle and Barcelona in the previous week. The Blues' attacking chances were limited, and Jerzy Dudek was equal to Frank Lampard's powerfully-struck drive and Drogba's low shot. Despite their frustration, Chelsea began to dominate midfield without seriously threatening to break Liverpool's well-organised defence. Joe Cole had a shot blocked and a promising Damien Duff break was halted by a good tackle from Djimi Traore, but the Reds reached half-time without any major scares. The Blues began the second half with more urgency and pegged Liverpool back. Nevertheless, Liverpool were living dangerously and they needed a fantastic double save from Dudek on 54 minutes, first at full stretch from Gudjohnsen's header, then to smother William Gallas' follow-up. And despite Chelsea's possession, it was Liverpool who fashioned the next clear opportunity as Luis Garcia fed Dietmar Hamann whose shot forced a superb save from Cech. And the Blues' increasingly adventurous approach saw Liverpool earn another chance on the break on 75 minutes as Paulo Ferreira denied Gerrard with a last-ditch tackle. But Gerrard was on the scoresheet minutes later - in the most unfortunate fashion - as he inadvertently deflected Ferrerira's free-kick past his own keeper and in off the post to bring Chelsea level. That prompted Mourinho's reaction which saw him sent off, but Chelsea still pressed and Duff had a chance to win the game with seven minutes remaining. Dudek saved bravely at the Irishman's feet, while Milan Baros shot wildly at the other end to ensure extra time. Drogba almost headed Chelsea in front two minutes into extra-time but the striker saw the ball rebound off the post. But seconds after the half-time interval, Drogba made no mistake, picking the ball up from Glen Johnson's long throw inside the six-yard box and sidefooting home. And Kezman appeared to have made the game safe as he netted from close range after Gudjohnsen's cross in the 110th minute. There was still drama as Nunez beat Cech to a high ball with six minutes remaining to head his side level, but despite Liverpool's desperate attacks, Chelsea clung on to win.

Children ânot as fast as their parents wereâ Children ânot as fast as their parents wereâ Study of global fitness shows children today cannot run as far or as fast as their parents did Most children today cannot run as far or as fast as their parents did, according to a study of global fitness. Photograph: PA Most children today cannot run as far or as fast as their parents did, according to a study of global fitness. The decline, which may indicate worse health in adulthood, was discovered following an international study of running fitness in children over the last 50 years. It found that childrenâs cardiovascular fitness had dropped markedly worldwide since about 1975. Over a mile run, youngsters today would be about a minute and a half slower than children 30 years ago. Dr Grant Tomkinson, the studyâs lead author from the University of South Australia , said: âIf a young person is generally unfit now, then they are more likely to develop conditions like heart disease later in life. âYoung people can be fit in different ways. They can be strong like a weightlifter, or flexible like a gymnast, or skillful like a tennis player. But not all of these types of fitness relate well to health. âThe most important type of fitness for good health is cardiovascular fitness, which is the ability to exercise vigorously for a long time, like running multiple laps around an oval track.â Researchers analysed 50 studies on running fitness between 1964 and 2010 of more than 25 million children aged nine to 17 in 28 countries. They gauged cardiovascular endurance by how far they could run in a set time or how long it took to run a set distance, typically lasted five to 15 minutes or covering half a mile to two miles. Cardiovascular endurance declined significantly within the 46 years, the researchers revealed at the American Heart Associationâs annual meeting yesterday. On average, endurance has declined consistently by about 5 per cent every decade, while children are about 15 per cent less fit on a cardiovascular measure than their parents were at their age. In the US, childrenâs cardiovascular endurance fell by an average of 6 per cent per decade between 1970 and 2000. The problem is largely one of Western countries, but some parts of Asia like South Korea, mainland China and Hong Kong are also seeing this phenomenon. To stay healthy, children and young people need to do at least an hour of physical activity - such as walking or cycling to school and running in the playground - every day. It can be done in small chunks rather than one session The average changes were similar between boys and girls, younger and older children, and across different regions, although they varied country to country. The decline in cardiovascular endurance performance was probably caused by social, behavioural, physical, psychosocial and physiological factors, Dr Tomkinson said. The fitness findings were mirrored by measurements of being overweight or obesity and body fat, suggesting one factor may cause the other. âIn fact, about 30 per cent to 60 per cent of the declines in endurance running performance can be explained by increases in fat mass,â Dr Tomkinson said. He added that children should take part in at least 60 minutes of daily activities that use the bodyâs big muscles, such as running, swimming or cycling. âWe need to help to inspire children and youth to develop fitness habits that will keep them healthy now and into the future,â Dr Tomkinson said. âThey need to choose a range of physical activities they like or think they might like to try, and they need to get moving.â Agencies
Consumer concern over RFID tags Consumer concern over RFID tags Consumers are very concerned about the use of radio frequency ID (RFID) tags in shops, a survey says. More than half of 2,000 people surveyed said they had privacy worries about the tags, which can be used to monitor stock on shelves or in warehouses. Some consumer groups have expressed concern that the tags could be used to monitor shoppers once they had left shops with their purchases. The survey showed that awareness of tags among consumers in Europe was low. The survey of consumers in the UK, France, Germany and the Netherlands was carried out by consultancy group Capgemini. The firm works on behalf of more than 30 firms who are seeking to promote the growth of RFID technology. The tags are a combination of computer chip and antenna which can be read by a scanner - each item contains a unique identification number. More than half (55%) of the respondents said they were either concerned or very concerned that RFID tags would allow businesses to track consumers via product purchases. Fifty nine percent of people said they were worried that RFID tags would allow data to be used more freely by third parties. Ard Jan Vetham, Capgemini's principal consultant on RFID, said the survey showed that retailers needed to inform and educate people about RFID before it would become accepted technology. "Acceptance of new technologies always has a tipping point at which consumers believe that benefits outweigh concerns. "With the right RFID approach and ongoing communication with consumers, the industry can reach this point." He said that the survey also showed people would accept RFID if they felt that the technology could mean a reduction in car theft or faster recovery of stolen items. The tags are currently being used at one Tesco distribution centre in the UK - the tags allow the rapid inventory of bulk items. They are also in use as a passcard for the M6 Toll in the Midlands, in the UK. Mr Vetham said the majority of people surveyed (52%) believed that RFID tags could be read from a distance. He said that was a misconception based on a lack of awareness of the technology. At least once consumer group - Consumers Against Supermarket Privacy Invasion and Numbering (Caspian) - has claimed that RFID chips could be used to secretly identify people and the things they are carrying or wearing. All kinds of personal belongings, including clothes, could constantly broadcast messages about their whereabouts and their owners, it warned. Comments are closed for this article.
Consumer sentiment continues to rise in October Consumer sentiment continues to rise in October Index now at highest level since June 2007 as brighter economic outlook boosts confidence Domestic rather than global developments prompted the rise in Irish consumer sentiment this month, according to KBC Bank Ireland. Photograph: Eric Luke/The Online News Irish consumer sentiment continued to improve last month following a six-year high in September, as a brighter economic outlook boosted consumersâ willingness to spend. The KBC Bank Ireland/ESRI consumer sentiment index rose to 76.2 in October from 73.1 in September, reaching the highest level since June 2007. âThe survey hints at an emerging view that the Irish economy is now clearly past the worst even if there is little expectation that dramatically stronger conditions are set to take hold,â KBC economist Austin Hughes said. âSpending power is still under pressure but signs of improvement in the jobs and property markets may be making consumers a little more willing to spend.â There is still volatility in consumer sentiment however, with six monthly increases and four monthly declines in the index so far this year, suggesting consumers are still having difficulty making sense of an uncertain economic landscape, according to KBC. As all but 32 of the 806 survey interviews were carried out before the budget, the impact of cuts on consumer sentiment will only be known when the November survey is compiled. All components of the survey improved in October with the exception of future household finances, which showed a modest decline. Mr Hughes said the October reading hinted that consumers were worried household spending power would be hit by the budget, but this concern wasnât as strong as it had been in previous years. âConsumers now see budget pain as the norm. However, they also knew that the adjustment would be towards the lower end of the previously signalled range while changes to income taxes and the main benefit rates were ruled out in advance.â The results suggest a majority of consumers donât expect the Irish economy to improve in the next 12 months, but there were some positive indicators that sentiment on the economic outlook is improving. Just 28 per cent of those surveyed responded with negative views about the economy, the lowest level since February 2006. Those responding positively rose slightly to 39 per cent, the highest proportion of positive views since August 2000. The rise in Irish consumer sentiment in October was stronger than the marginal improvement reported in euro zone confidence data. Comparable US consumer sentiment indexes showed a marked weakening in the month, attributable to concerns over the consequences of the Federal government shut-down and difficulties in resolving debt ceiling issues. This implies that domestic rather than global developments prompted the rise in Irish consumer sentiment this month, according to KBC. There was also a fractional improvement in sentiment towards the jobs market, attributable to a host of new jobs announcements and a further decline in Live Register numbers in September and October. The authors of the report say the most surprising element of the October results was the significant improvement in buying climate, which may have been influenced by exceptionally low inflation and special consumer offers. .

Curbishley delight for Johansson Curbishley delight for Johansson Charlton manager Alan Curbishley paid tribute to two-goal striker Jonatan Johansson after beating Norwich. Curbishley said after the 4-0 win: "There was talk about Norwich being interested in the summer but I have a lot of faith in Jonatan. "When there was talk of other clubs I just told him he was going nowhere. "He's part of our squad and he got us a couple of important goals early on. I'm sure he's happy here, but I was delighted with all the players." Curbishley was subjected to criticism from Charlton fans recently, and he said: "The thing about this club is that we have got where we are by all pulling in the same direction. "That's happened for however long I've been here and we don't want people taking sides." Return to results
Data due tomorrow expected to show unemployment steady at 7.7% Data due tomorrow expected to show unemployment steady at 7.7% House prices rose 3.8 per cent in the year to August, the fastest rise since October 2010. Photograph: Chris Ison/PA Wire British inflation was higher than expected in September and house prices posted their biggest rise in almost three years in August, adding to scepticism about how long the central bank can hold down interest rates. Annual consumer price inflation was unchanged from August according to the Office for National Statistics data today, defying forecasts for a tick-down to 2.6 percent. British government bond prices fell further after the release, lifting benchmark yields - a proxy for market interest rate bets - to a three-week high. However, separate official data published today showed that annual factory gate inflation slowed sharply in September, pointing to an easing in pipeline price pressures. âWith house prices continuing to rise ... and tomorrowâs labour report set to show ongoing job gains, we continue to look for an early 2015 rate hike,â said ING economist James Knightley. In August the central bank pledged not to raise borrowing costs before Britainâs unemployment falls to 7 per cent - something the bank forecasts will take three years - unless inflation threatens to get out of control. Bank of England policymaker Martin Weale reiterated his concerns that âforward guidanceâ policies could stoke inflation expectations Data due tomorrow is expected to show the jobless rate remained at 7.7 per cent in August. An increase in air fares did most to boost growth in consumer prices, while the main downward pressure on inflation came from motor fuels. As a result, core consumer price inflation - which includes air fares but excludes energy costs - rose to 2.2 per cent. The statistics office said house prices rose 3.8 per cent in the year to August, the fastest rise since October 2010. House prices are likely to get a further boost from the governmentâs mortgage guarantee scheme, launched last week. Critics fear the latest phase of the Help to Buy programme will result in another housing bubble rather than more home building. British inflation has persistently exceeded wage growth, which is running at around 1 percent. Last week British energy supplier SSE inflamed a political row over falling living standards when it raised prices by an average of 8.2 per cent. INGâs Knightley noted that utility prices could rise further in coming months, keeping inflation well above the Bank of Englandâs 2 per cent target. But other economists supported the central bankâs view that domestic inflation pressures remain subdued and the economy has plenty of scope to grow. Online News .

Davy economist says macroeconomic conditions do not explain continuing rise in number in mortgage ar... Davy economist says macroeconomic conditions do not explain continuing rise in number in mortgage arrears Peter Breuer, resident representative of the International Monetary Fund in Ireland, at the Dublin Economics Workshop in Limerick. Photograph: Don Moloney/Press 22 The deteriorating mortgage arrears situation is a damning indictment of the banks and the regulator, the Dublin Economics Workshop heard at the weekend. Conall Mac Coille of Davy said macroeconomic conditions do not explain the continuing rise in the number of mortgage accounts in arrears. A pending Central Bank survey will show that two-thirds of those with mortgages in arrears are in employment and the governor of the Central Bank said the data indicates that a âmodest changeâ in many peopleâs spending would see them able to service their mortgages. David McNamara, also of Davy, said solutions to date had been short-term ones, such as temporary lower repayments, and the Dunne judgment in 2009, along with other factors, had led to the creation of a confused regulatory environment. Economist Seamus Coffey of UCC said the rules had been such that you could go into arrears without any real consequences and people had played according to those rules. He said that in the US loans in difficulty would be altered so that the remaining principal could be paid with about 31 per cent of gross salary. If such solution was not possible, the homes were repossessed. Mr McNamara said a lot of landlords were close to retiring age and on short-term loan contracts involving interest-only and tracker rates. When these loans had to be refinanced, many would find their situation unsustainable. âThe ECB rate is going to go up and the banks are planning on fat margins,â he said. Mr Coffey said the statistics showed that the loans that were in arrears included ones issued as far back as 1995. The spread was across the range of originating dates and this suggested many of the loans might be in positive equity. He said there should be more repossessions and that if loans canât be repaid, then they should be written off. He said the statistics showed there were loans to the value of â¬114 billion out at the end of 2011 to the residential mortgage market and â¬34 billion out to buy to let. He said 580,000 households had mortgages out of a total of 1.7 million households. About a third of households have mortgages, a third do not, and a third are local authority and other types. There has been a jump in the number of privately rented households from 145,000 in 2006 to 305,000 in 2011. The arrears statistics show a massively deteriorating picture since September 2009, when the statistics began. There are 770,000 accounts associated with primary dwellings (some houses have more than one account), out of which 142,000 cases are in arrears. The average mortgage in arrears (â¬179,000) is bigger than the average mortgage (â¬141,000). Return to results
Dr Maurice Neligan. Dr Maurice Neligan. Sports concussion expert Dr Micky Collins is the keynote speaker at UPMC Beacon orthopaedic summit next Saturday at the Aviva Stadium in Dublin which will focus on sports injury management and concussion in particular. Although there have been a couple of high profile incidents here in recent months where players have continued on the pitch despite receiving a knock to the head, Beacon consultant orthopaedic surgeon Maurice Neligan , pictured, says awareness and the level of caution with which concussion is treated has improved in recent years. âBefore that it was less recognised and it was not treated,â he says. âIt was almost considered manly to stay on the pitch and to be able to play on. Now itâs recognised that thatâs actually quite a dangerous thing.â Dr Collins was one of the co-founders of the Impact assessment in the US which involves a 25-minute cognitive test to evaluate if a sports person is suffering from concussion. Only when they get a score, within a certain percentage of what they received when originally taking the test, can they return to play. âThat is a very, very powerful tool and itâs been used millions and millions of times,â Mr Neligan says. âAny high school, or collegiate, or professional athlete in most sports in the United States would do it.â The IRFU is also a user. âItâs more scientific now when people can go back [to play],â says Mr Neligan, adding that 90 per cent of concussions will go away after 7-10 days. Some cases can be âextremely seriousâ with the concussion ending a personâs sporting career or changing their personality. One example he recalls was a concussion that prevented an Olympic-class rower from getting back on the water. âThe light striking the waves completely disorientated her and she used to vomit.â The potential effects of concussions on sports people are now acknowledged. Earlier this year the National Football League in the US agreed to pay $765 million to settle a case brought by some 4,500 players and their families. However Mr Neligan says the evidence is not conclusive on whether a series of sustained concussions throughout a career can do lasting damage. Led by physiotherapist Ruth Whelan , a UPMC team has been working with the GAA to develop an education programme due to be rolled out over the coming months. Mr Neligan says the programme is likely to involve an e-learning test followed by practical teaching and instruction. âSomeone will have some sort of basic qualification then in recognising concussion. Every club will then be encouraged to have people in their club that have those skills.â Comments are closed for this article.
Draghi predicts âprolongedâ period of low inflation Draghi predicts âprolongedâ period of low inflation Frankfurt leaves key interest rate at 0.25% at last policy meeting of 2013 Mario Draghi, president of the European Central Bank (ECB) sits between Commerzbank chief executive Martin Blessing (left) and Deutsche Bank chief executive Juergen Fitschen (right) prior to the start of the European Banking Congress at the old opera house in Frankfurt last month. Photograph: Kai Pfaffenbach/Online News Euro zone inflation will stay well below target for the next two years and the European Central Bank is ready to act if necessary to lift a listless economy, it saidtoday. The ECB left its key interest rate at 0.25 per cent at its last policy meeting of the year, choosing not to follow through on Novemberâs surprise cut. Markets expect further action in 2014, something ECB president Mario Draghi did nothing to deflect. âWe may experience a prolonged period of low inflation to be followed by a gradual upward movement ... later on,â Mr Draghi told a news conference. âWe are monitoring developments closely and are ready to consider all available instruments.â He said todayâs discussion had not focused on any one measure but there had been a âbrief discussionâ about cutting the deposit rate into negative territory, in an attempt to get banks lending more. The decision to hold the main refinancing rate at a record low was widely expected after inflation edged up to 0.9 per cent in November, partially reversing a plunge to 0.7 per cent the month before. Unemployment has also fallen slightly. Fresh forecasts from ECB staff predicted inflation would average just 1.1 per cent next year and 1.3 per cent in 2015 - well below the ECBâs target of close to but below 2 per cent. Growth is seen at a sluggish 1.1 per cent next year, although that is slightly higher than the 1.0 per cent estimated in September. Mr Draghi said the risks to that outlook were skewed to the downside. Those threats included higher commodity prices, weaker domestic demand and export growth, and failure by euro zone government to implement structural economic reforms.

Dunne keen to commit to Man City Dunne keen to commit to Man City Richard Dunne is ready to commit his long-term future to Manchester City after turning his career around. He was once threatened with the sack by City boss Kevin Keegan but has since responded with impressive performances, prompting interest from other clubs. Early talks have taken place and the defender said: "Hopefully something will be sorted out as soon as possible. "I definitely want to stay at City because I have really improved as a player here." Newcastle boss Graeme Souness is said to have been impressed enough by Dunne's turnaround in form to be ready to make a bid for the big stopper in the January transfer window. But the 25-year-old Dubliner underlined his intention to stay at Eastlands. He added: "It's nice to be linked with top clubs but the important thing is this one and what we do. "I really enjoy it at City and I want to keep that going." Keegan is expected to be told there will be no funds to bring in fresh faces in January. Dunne's professionalism was famously questioned by Keegan, who ordered the defender home after he allegedly turned up for training in a dishevelled state. But Dunne is keen to put that period of his life behind him and said: "I've grown up a lot and the manager sees me as one of the most experienced players in the squad. "I've played more games than any other outfield players this season so I can't be regarded as being a kid any more. "I have to use that as added pressure to perform and apart from the games at Newcastle and Middlesbrough, defensively we've done quite well." Keegan is set for another boost when goalkeeper Nicky Weaver makes his long-awaited return in a reserve game at Blackburn on Tuesday. Former England Under-21 keeper Weaver has missed nearly three full seasons with a succession of knee injuries, which eventually needed pioneering transplant surgery earlier this year.

FA ready to test out goal bleeper FA ready to test out goal bleeper The Football Association may volunteer to test a new goal-line bleeper when the game's bosses meet this weekend. The technology will be presented at the annual meeting of the International FA Board (IFAB), made up of Fifa and the four home nation associations. The bleeper-type system alerts the referee when the ball, containing a micro-chip, crosses the goal-line. There have been calls for the technology after Tottenham had a goal controversially disallowed last month. Spurs were denied a winner against Manchester United, despite Pedro Mendes' effort crossing the line. Mendes' speculative strike from the halfway line comfortably crossed the goal-line after an error from United keeper Roy Carroll. But with the referee and assistant referee unable to get a proper view of the incident, the 'goal' was not given. This latest breakthrough in electronic aids could help referees avoid situations like this in future. If it impresses the IFAB, then the Football League are likely to experiment with the new technology. FA executive director David Davies said: "We will be very interested to see this presentation - it's true we have been more interested in the use of technology than other members of the board. "But this is not video technology, the referee will have a direct link with this form of technology rather than having to rely on a fourth official or video back-up. "Whether this form of technology will find wider support than previous efforts remains to be seen but if there was enthusiasm I'm sure we would seriously discuss with our leagues whether they would be interested in this sort of innovation." The Football League have already made one offer to Fifa to test out goal-line technology and spokesman John Nagle confirmed: "That offer is still on the table." The presentation to the IFAB by adidas will need to persuade Fifa president Sepp Blatter, especially as he has always resisted bringing technology into the game. Comments are closed for this article.
Fast moving phone bugs appear Fast moving phone bugs appear Security firms are warning about several mobile phone viruses that can spread much faster than similar bugs. The new strains of the Cabir mobile phone virus use short-range radio technology to leap to any vulnerable phone as soon as it is in range. The Cabir virus only affects high-end handsets running the Symbian Series 60 phone operating system. Despite the warnings, there are so far no reports of any phones being infected by the new variants of Cabir. The original Cabir worm came to light in mid-June 2004 when it was sent to anti-virus firms as a proof-of-concept program. A mistake in the way the original Cabir was written meant that even if it escaped from the laboratory, the bug would only have been able to infect one phone at a time. However, the new Cabir strains have this mistake corrected and will spread via short range Bluetooth technology to any vulnerable phone in range. Bluetooth has an effective range of a few tens of metres. The risk of being infected by Cabir is low because users must give the malicious program permission to download on to their handset and then must manually install it. Users can protect themselves by altering a setting on Symbian phones that conceals the handset from other Bluetooth using devices. Finnish security firm F-Secure issued a warning about the new strains of Cabir but said that the viruses do not do any damage to a phone. All they do is block normal Bluetooth activity and drain the phone's battery. Anti-virus firm Sophos said the source code for Cabir had been posted on the net by a Brazilian programmer which might lead to even more variants of the program being created. So far seven versions of Cabir are know to exist, one of which was inside the malicious Skulls program that was found in late November. Symbian's Series 60 software is licenced by Nokia, LG Electronics, Lenovo, Panasonic, Samsung, Sendo and Siemens. Return to results
Featured: 'Podcasters' look to net money 'Podcasters' look to net money Nasa is doing it, 14-year-old boys in bedrooms are doing it, couples are doing it, gadget lovers - male and female - are definitely doing it. It is podcasting - DIY radio in the form of downloadable MP3 audio files. They can done by anyone who has a microphone, simple software, the net, and something to say. Some liken them to talking "audioblogs" because many complement text-based weblogs - diary-like sites where people share their thoughts. They are essentially amateur radio shows on the net, on demand, and the "movement" is at very early stages. "It's about real people saying real things and communicating," says Adam Curry, former MTV VJ and the Pied Piper of podcasting. He was one of a community of people who created iPodder, a small computer program, known as an "aggregator". It collects and automatically sends MP3 files to any digital music-playing device that can play WMP formats. Those with digital music players can select which podcasts they like, and subscribe - for free - to that show's "feed". When a new podcast is available, it is automatically sent to the device when connected to a computer. "It is totally going to kill the business model of radio," thinks Curry. "I just did a tour of Madison Avenue where all the big brands and advertising agencies of the world are," he says. "And they are scared to death of the next generation - like my daughter who is 14 - who don't listen to radio. "They are on MSN, they've got their iPod, their MP3 player, they've got their Xbox - they are not listening to radio. "So how are they going to reach these audiences? "It is the distribution that is changing and the barriers are being brought down so everyone can be part of it." It is a fledgling movement, but it is gaining momentum now that people have started thinking about how to make a business from it. Ian Fogg, Jupiter Research analyst, thinks there could be potential for business, but it could take an interesting turn if big companies, like Apple and Microsoft, get involved. "It is a nascent area but quite exciting. It is yet another area that demonstrates the move to a digital lifestyle and digital home is not over," he says. "Podcasting is one of those interesting areas that bridges what you do at home and what you do out and about - a classic hybrid. It is another aspect of the "time-shifting" of content - the latest industry buzzword for being able to listen to what you want, when, and wherever you want. Audiences are in the 10s, 100s, and 1,000s rather than millions. More than 4,300 podcasts are currently listed. Curry's Daily Source Code - which he committed to doing daily to inspire the community - has 10s of thousands of listeners. But Dave Winer is doubtful. He designed the format called RSS (Really Simple Syndication), which gives web users an easy way to keep updated automatically on sites they like. Podcasts rely on his technology because it is the way they are distributed. He is also writer of the longest-running weblog on the net, Scripting News. He thinks its power lies in its democratising potential, not in its "over-hyped" business promise. "We're the sources, the people doing stuff, and podcasting is a way to tell people who care what we're doing. "No matter how you look at it, commercialising this medium isn't going to make very much money," he says. "Podcasting is going to be a medium of niches, with 'audiences' measured in the single digits, like e-mail or blogs. "Maybe in a few years, maybe six or seven digits. But it will have to sustain interest beyond the hype balloon." Curry and associate Ron Bloom's new venture, called PodShow, is to help ordinary people produce, post, distribute and market their podcasts. Because of the way podcasts work, based on RSS, the latest podcasts which people can select mean that they are ready-made targets. "When you look at podcasting - wow this is a pretty interesting audience. The audience is pre-selected. They have decided to subscribe to your program," explains Curry. Advertising, in his eyes, can be tailored to podcasts, to make it more imaginative and unobtrusive. "How I believe this will work, is to create a network that, in aggregation, will have enough numbers to support a return on investment for the advertisers and for the podcasters. "I have 50, 60, 70,000 listeners. I could make a couple of bucks off that, but not much. If you are talking a million podcasters, and then you can kind of divide that amongst ourselves, then that is kind of interesting." Essentially, he says, if you are doing a bass fishing podcast, someone who is selling bait and tackle will probably want to advertise on your show. He is clear the ads will not be the traditional "in-your-face" type familiar to commercial radio now. "We are really going to see these microcosms and commerce will be all over the place." It is happening already. Coffee-loving Curry has sold $4,000 worth of coffee machines through a referral link to Amazon from his site. Others use in-show promotions, like The Dawn and Drew Show. One, Eric Rice, has won sponsorship from Warner Bros. He can now legally play the music of a band Warner Bros wants to push. Some commentators on the net say it has a similar feel to the dotcom days. Others say it is just another element of setting media free from big companies and letting people be creative. One thing is for sure; they are not about to disappear in a hurry. The creative forces behind radio are elated, says Curry. For now, he tunes out the negative comments within the podcasting community. "I should be knighted for this," he adds, with a wry chuckle, "People are going to be so happy to sit at home, make their podcast, and make a little money."
Ferdinand casts doubt over Glazer Ferdinand casts doubt over Glazer Rio Ferdinand has said he is unsure of Malcolm Glazer's motives after the American billionaire launched a new offer to buy Manchester United. The club have confirmed that the Glazer Family Partnership have submitted proposals of a third bid. "A lot of people want the club's interest to be with people who have grown up with the club and have got its interests at heart," said Ferdinand. "No one knows what this guy will be bringing to the table." The central defender added on Online News Radio Five Live: "We will have to wait and see what Glazer comes with. "I would like to see the situation resolved either way. "I think people are getting bored with him coming in and out of the news with new proposals. "The other stuff off the pitch takes the shine off what is going on the pitch." Glazer, currently owns a 28.1% stake in the club, and United's statement to the stock exchange said: "The board has noted the recent press speculation on this subject. "The board can confirm that it has now received a detailed proposal subject to various pre-conditions which may form the basis of an offer for Manchester United from Glazer. "A further announcement will be made in due course." Glazer's previous bids for the club, which United supporters opposed, were rejected by the board because of the high level of debt they would incur. But it is believed that Glazer has substantially reduced the borrowing required for his latest move. He will still need the approval of major shareholders John Magnier and JP McManus, who own 28.9% of the club to succeed. But the Irish duo have cut off talks with Glazer over the proposed sale of their stake, while fans remain opposed to his involvement. Comments are closed for this article.
Findings of Halappanavar inquiries to be discussed at special meeting Findings of Halappanavar inquiries to be discussed at special meeting HSE group to meet in Galway to examine three investigations into womanâs death at UHG in 2012 Prof Sabaratnam Arulkatumaran (left) , chairperson, and Dr Philip Crowler, National Director for Quality and Patient Safety, at the publication of the Health Service Executive (HSE) clinical review report into the death of Savita Halappanavar in Dublin in June. Photograph: Eric Luke/The Online News The findings of all three investigations into the death of Savita Halappanavar (31) at University Hospital Galway (UHG) a year ago are to discussed at a special meeting of the HSE West-North West Hospital Group tonight. The meeting has been convened following last weekâs publication of the third report into Ms Halappanavarâs death, after she was admitted to UHG last October when she was 17 weeks pregnant and miscarrying. The Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) report confirmed 13 âmissed opportunitiesâ during Ms Halappanavarâs care in hospital, which, if identified and acted upon, could have resulted in a different outcome. The board members are due to consider the HIQA findings, and those of the inquest and the Health Service Executive (HSE) investigations, and identify what further should be taken. The boardâs structure had been criticised in the HIQA report, which noted that the appointment by the chairperson of the four executive directors was ânot in linewith the authorityâs recommendations in its 2012 investigation report into theAdelaide and Meath Hospital, Dublin incorporating the National Childrenâs Hospital (Tallaght Hospital), adopted by the Department of Healthâ. It is understood that this will be discussed at tonightâs (thurs) meeting, which is closed to the media. Mayor of Galway Padraig Conneely (FG) has called on four board members who are attached to the Galway-Roscommon university hospitals group to absent themselves from tonightâs discussions. Mr Conneely called on hospital group chief executive Bill Maher, chief financial officer Maurice Power, clinical director Dr Pat Nash , and director of nursing and midwifery Colette Cowan not to attend , due to what he termed a âconflict of interestsâ. âThere will be no accountability and no restoration of confidence in the regional health service if it is perceived that the board responsible for acting on this report is stuffed with senior management who would effectively be policing themselves,âMr Conneely said. âOther HSE hospitals across the country have removed management from their boards in accordance with recommendations by HIQA last year. This is not the case in Galway-Roscommon,âMr Conneely said. The joint hospitals group said it had no comment to make. Mr Conneely has made a formal complaint to the Medical Council this week about the actions of the consultant obstetrician responsible for Ms Halappanavarâs care. The complaint will be referred to the Medical Councilâs preliminary proceedings committee which will decide whether the matter should be referred to a full inquiry, he said.

Further savings can be made in the health system without affecting services to patients, the EU-IMF ... Further savings can be made in the health system without affecting services to patients, the EU-IMF troika has said. The HSE still has some way to go to fully reform the health system and reduce costs to acceptable levels, troika officials advised in a media briefing yesterday. The cost of patented and generic medicines was again singled out by officials as being unacceptably high, despite the measures taken by the Government to reduce costs. Document: Letter to HSE The HSE needs to make further improvements to its financial management system to allow it get a handle on costs, they also said. Significant cost savings could also be achieved through the introduction of a single health identifier for all patients as well as a system of electronic prescription. Officials emphasised the need for Ireland to drive forward a systematic approach to healthcare reform even after Irelandâs programme ends in December. Ultimately, it came to Ireland making choices about where to reduce costs in such a way that services were not affected. Having said on a previous occasion that it cost twice as much to see a GP in Ireland as in Brussels, officials said this information had been checked and it actually cost more than twice as much to access a doctor here. Patient safety The troikaâs assessment follows the intervention in the debate on health cuts by the chief executives of four Dublin hospitals, who have warned that hospital funding cuts, together with increased demand, have begun to seriously threaten the quality and safety of patient services. As a result, they say in a letter to HSE director general Tony OâBrien, âunacceptable delaysâ have emerged in accessing treatments for some cancer patients as a result of the overwhelming pressures on services. âParadoxically, the consequences of these quality and safety problems place an even greater long-run financial burden on the hospital system,â the letter from the heads of Our Ladyâs Hospital for Sick Children, Tallaght hospital, St Jamesâs Hospital and the Mater hospital warns. A spokesman for Minister for Health James Reilly said he had already made clear to the HSE a requirement to make patient safety a priority within the service plan. âDespite the hugely competing demands on the service planâs budget, he will not accept an insufficient allocation for measures supporting safe patient care.â The National Cancer Control Programme said it hadnât been contacted by any of the four chief executives about delays in cancer treatment, and it wasnât aware of any acute problems. Delays of up to four days in providing children with cancer treatment were reported yesterday by Owen Smith, an oncologist at Crumlin. Two other big Dublin hospitals did not sign the letter, which was leaked before it reached Mr OâBrien: St Vincentâs, which disagreed with the approach taken by the other institutions; and Beaumont, whose chief executive was away when the letter was being drafted. Service plan The HSE is drawing up a service plan for 2014 which will set out in detail where cuts will be made to services i to meet a spending reduction target of at least â¬666 million, as flagged in the budget last month. There is considerable resistance within the Department of Health, the HSE and hospitals to the level of cuts being demanded. The four hospitals claim they have been doubly impacted by funding cuts resulting from the economic downturn and âdisproportionateâ reductions in the hospitals budget compared to other programmes. As a result, their budgets have been cut by â¬206 million, or more than 20 per cent, since 2009. âEvidence would suggest that these reductions have been determined and applied arbitrarily both to and within the acute sector,â they claim. The chief executives are also critical of Dr Reillyâs plans to introduce a âmoney follows the patientâ model next year. While supporting this funding approach, they say the systems arenât âeven closeâ to being ready for application in 2014. .

Gallas sees two-horse race Gallas sees two-horse race Chelsea's William Gallas believes they will battle it out with Arsenal for the Premiership in the coming months. "It'll be a two-horse race all the way to the end of the season because we are both going to give it everything," he told Online News Sport. "You need to be good and you need a lot of luck. You need a bit of both but it will be as hard for the Arsenal players as it is for the Chelsea boys." "We know that we have got the power in our hands just now," added Gallas. "But you never know what is going to happen in football - two seasons ago Manchester United picked up so many points towards the end of the season when they won the title. "Obviously, nobody at Chelsea wants to come second but you never know what happens in football. "We will be challenging to come first as much as every Arsenal player will be challenging to come first." Gallas has been given extra confidence by the impact manager Jose Mourinho has had since taking over as manager during the summer. And the French international defender believes Mourinho is perfectly suited to boss the squad of Chelsea stars and says his managerial expertise will prevent any player revolt. "It's only normal when you have got a team put together of such big names that you put the finishing touch to it and the finishing touch at Chelsea is a fantastic manager like Mourinho," he said. "He is the icing on the cake at the club. He has this fantastic knack of thinking of everything. "Another incredible quality that Mourinho has is that every player, even though the fans may consider them to be a stars, within the dressing-room they are absolutely equal. "Mourinho reminds everyone but he doesn't have to because he has created a wonderful atmosphere where everybody is playing and laughing every day. "It is a changed dressing-room from the atmosphere there was last year." Comments are closed for this article.
Germany under fire over trade surplus as exports hit new high Germany under fire over trade surplus as exports hit new high Berlin urged to push domestic demand and boost exports from crisis-hit neighbours Germanyâs trade surplus rose to a record high in September as exports climbed across the board, data showed yesterday. Photograph: Online News/Fabian Bimmer Yesterdayâs news that German exports have hit a record high has triggered another round in the long-running war of words over Berlinâs trade surplus. It comes as pressure grew on France to push through far-reaching labour market reforms after a surprise downgrade in its credit rating. Germany exported some â¬94.7 billion worth of goods in September â up 3.6 per cent year-on-year â and imported â¬74.3 billion. The resulting trade surplus of â¬20.4 billion cracked the record of â¬19.8 billion registered in June 2008. Exports to the EU rose by 5.4 per cent, one point up on euro area exports, while imports from both blocs dropped. A week ago Washington resumed its transatlantic spat with Berlin by describing its trade surplus as a problem for euro zone partners. It urged Germany to push domestic demand and boost exports from crisis-hit euro neighbours like Spain and Greece . The International Monetary Fund has said that a German trade surplus is the only way to rebalance the euro zone, while on Tuesday, EU economic and monetary affairs commissioner Olli Rehn called on Germanyâs next government to cut taxes and social contributions to boost domestic demand. EU surplus limit European Commission officials have indicated they are watching closely to see whether Germany breaches an EU surplus limit of an average of 6 per cent over three years. In Frankfurt this week, European Commission president JosÃ© Manuel Barroso suggested, more diplomatically, that it was time for Germany to do its âhomeworkâ for euro zone stability. These regular criticisms of its economic performance are brushed off in Germany, where the domestic media views itself as an âexport world championâ. For German supply-side economic ears, criticism of its trade surplus does not compute as a call to boost German imports. Instead, it is understood as demand to rein in its booming export sector. This is rejected out of hand as counterproductive by Germans, who view their economy as the economic motor of Europe . Path to competitiveness Rather than punish its big car and engineering exporters, Germany insists other countries must follow the same path to competitiveness by reducing budget deficits to boost their growth prospects. ECB president Mario Draghi gave his implicit backing to Berlin on Thursday, saying euro zone imbalances should be overcome without weakening the blocâs strongest economies. Meanwhile, French president FranÃ§ois Hollandeâs administration came under pressure after Standard & Poorâs cut its rating by one notch to AA from AA+, putting France on a par with Belgium and two notches above Italy . â (Additional reporting: Online News service) Return to results
Groups seeks implementation of 2008 protocol on babiesâ discharge from hospital Groups seeks implementation of 2008 protocol on babiesâ discharge from hospital A group advocating for the families of âtracheostomyâ babies will today call on Minister for Health James Reilly to implement a 2008 HSE protocol for the infantsâ âsafe and timelyâ discharge from hospital A group advocating for the families of âtracheostomyâ babies will today call on Minister for Health James Reilly to implement a 2008 HSE protocol for the infantsâ âsafe and timelyâ discharge from hospital. The Tracheostomy Advocacy Group is meeting the Minister and representatives of the HSE this afternoon. It has been calling for a national protocol on the discharge of babies with tracheostomies, with a dedicated unit within the HSE for the delivery and management of homecare packages. Earlier this month The Online News highlighted the situation of seven babies in Our Ladyâs Childrenâs Hospital, Crumlin, who, having had tracheostomies, were well enough to go home but could not as the HSE was refusing to sanction safe homecare packages. A number of babies were facing their second Christmas in hospital. âCrisis levelâ Colm Young, the founder of the the group, said the situation had reached the âthe worst crisis level everâ. Tracheostomy babies, who have had a tube inserted into their tracheal wall, or windpipe, to enable them to breathe, require 24-hour specialised care, including having their tubes changed, cleaned and suctioned. Parents are trained before their children are discharged but homecare packages are required to ensure 24-hour cover and allow parents to sleep and attend to other responsibilities. Mr Young has described increasing delays in the HSE sanctioning funding for packages, lack of clarity as to the criteria parents must fulfil, disparities between and within HSE local areas on which families get packages, and problems with the management of packages after babies go home. He will today ask Dr Reilly to implement a draft protocol, drawn up by the HSE in 2008, which he says would go a âhuge way to resolving difficultiesâ. Return to results
HSE service plan cuts may cost thousands of medical cards HSE service plan cuts may cost thousands of medical cards Health spending plans to be validated by three Government departments Dr James Reilly: his spokesman said a key priority would be to maintain frontline health services at a time of rising demand Cost savings outlined in the HSEâs draft service plan for next year are likely to lead to the loss of thousands of medical cards next year, according to health sector sources. The HSE was last night due to hand over its spending plan for the coming year to Minister for Health Dr James Reilly which will set out in detail where cuts of at least â¬666 million will be made. For the first time, officials from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Department of the Taoiseach will be involved in scrutinising the draft plan. This is aimed at preventing cost over-runs which have dogged health spending in recent year. Neither the HSE nor the Department of Health were prepared to comment on the contents of the spending plan before its publication. A spokesman for Dr Reilly said a key priority would be to maintain frontline health services at a time of rising demand as a result of the ageing population and high birth rates. However, thousands of people are likely to lose medical cards next year as a result of a more thorough assessment of recipientsâ incomes, as well as changes to eligibility thresholds. For example, the income threshold that applies to over-70s medical cards will fall from â¬600 to â¬500 per week. Threshold The threshold for a couple is being changed from â¬1,200 to â¬900. Some 35,000 people affected by the measure will in future qualify for a GP-visit card rather than a full medical card. Medical card entitlement is also being changed for those returning to work. Henceforth, people re-entering the workforce will be entitled to a GP-visit card for three years, rather than a full medical card. In many respects these savings will mirror the 2013 service plan. This stated that policy changes would lead to a reduction of about 40,000 medical cards as a result of changes to income calculations. In the recent budget, Dr Reilly said a specific target saving of â¬113 million had been earmarked as part of a âprobityâ drive for 2014 involving closer scrutiny of eligibility for medical cards. One health source yesterday indicated it would be a stretch to reach savings of this magnitude, which may place pressure on other areas of health spending. The other main area of focus will be on how frontline health and social services may be affected as a result of spending cuts over the coming year. In the area of disability, it is understood that discussions over the spending for the coming year have proved positive and groups are cautiously optimistic that frontline services will be maintained. Voluntary hospitals claim that they have been doubly affected by funding cuts resulting from the economic downturn and âdisproportionateâ reductions in the hospitals budget compared to other programmes. Further savings The EU-IMF troika has said that further savings can be made in the health system without affecting services to patients. It has singled out cost of patented and generic medicines as being unacceptably high despite the measures taken by the Government to reduce costs While capital expenditure has been regarded by many as an area that may be targeted, Dr Reilly has said there is no question of this being cut. He said recently that projects including the new national childrenâs hospital, the relocation of the National Maternity Hospital from Holles Street to St Vincentâs Hospital campus and the planned move of the Central Mental Hospital from Dundrum to Portrane were priority issues.

HSE to seek additional â¬199m funding for 2013 HSE to seek additional â¬199m funding for 2013 Health Service Executive set to record overall net deficit of â¬219m for 2013 The deficit is higher than that forecast by Minister for Health James Reilly. Photograph: Eric Luke The HSE will ask the Government to provide an additional â¬199 million in funding for this year. The Online News has learned that the health authority will record an overall net deficit of â¬219 million for 2013. However, about â¬20 million is to be provided to the HSE from a surplus reported in the Department of Healthâs budget for this year. It is expected that Ministers will consider the HSE supplementary estimate at a Cabinet meeting tomorrow. It is also scheduled to be debated at a hearing of the Oireachtas health committee on Thursday. The overall financial deficit is less than the worst-case scenario of â¬286 million which the HSE projected in correspondence to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform several weeks ago. However, it is higher than the deficit for the year of about â¬150 million forecast by the Minister for Health James Reilly following the budget in October. A HSE spokesman declined to confirm the figures for the financial deficit. However, the spokesman said the HSEâs financial out-turn for 2013 was âremarkably good considering certain matters that had arisen over the course of the yearâ. Government policy issues Over the last 12 months the HSE has had to deal with financial pressures generated from a number of issues, particularly Government policy issues, outside of its control. This includes a Government decision not to seek â¬104 million in accelerated payments â essentially payments in advance â from the health insurance industry, as well as delays in introducing legislation to allow for greater scope to charge private patients treated in public hospitals. This measure was to have generated â¬60 million this year, but was deferred until 2014. Separately, a six-month delay by the Government in introducing cuts to the fees of healthcare professionals such as GPs and pharmacists meant that only about half of the â¬70 million target for savings earmarked in this area will be realised this year. The HSEâs budget for this year was also based on the assumption that â¬150 million in savings would flow from the Haddington Road agreement on public-service pay and productivity. However, it is expected to be confirmed this week that there will be a shortfall of â¬50 million on this target. Talks between the HSE, the Department of Health and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on the supplementary funding for this year have been going on in tandem with talks on the controversial service plan for the HSE for 2014. The HSE has been asked to generate savings of â¬666 million next year. A key element of the planned savings is a âprobityâ exercise in relation to medical cards which had a target of realising â¬113 million. In addition, a further â¬20 million in savings was sought in other parts of the budget for primary care services. Service plan The Online News reported at the end of November that HSE director general Tony OâBrien had warned in a letter accompanying the service plan that the scale of cuts envisaged to spending on medical card services was being taken against the advice of both his organisation and the Department of Health. The HSE service plan is being assessed by the Department of Health, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Department of the Taoiseach . Comments are closed for this article.
Have hackers recruited your PC? Have hackers recruited your PC? More than one million computers on the net have been hijacked to attack websites and pump out spam and viruses. The huge number was revealed by security researchers who have spent months tracking more than 100 networks of remotely-controlled machines. The largest network of so-called zombie networks spied on by the team was made up of 50,000 hijacked home computers. Data was gathered using machines that looked innocent but which logged everything hackers did to them. The detailed look at zombie or 'bot nets of hijacked computers was done by the Honeynet Project - a group of security researchers that gather information using networks of computers that act as "honey pots" to attract hackers and gather information about how they work. While 'bot nets have been known about for some time, estimates of how widespread they are from security firms have varied widely. To gather its information the German arm of the Honeynet Project created software tools to log what happened to the machines they put on the web. Getting the machines hijacked was worryingly easy. The longest time a Honeynet machine survived without being found by an automatic attack tool was only a few minutes. The shortest compromise time was only a few seconds. The research found that, once compromised machines tend to report in to chat channels on IRC servers and wait instructions from the malicious hacker behind the tools used to recruit the machine. Many well-known vulnerabilities in the Windows operating system were exploited by 'bot net controllers to find and take over target machines. Especially coveted were home PCs sitting on broadband connections that are never turned off. The months of surveillance revealed that the different 'bot nets - which involve a few hundred to tens of thousands of machines - are used for a variety of purposes. Many are used as relays for spam, to route unwanted adverts to PC users or as launch platforms for viruses. But the research team found that many are put to very different uses. During the monitoring period, the team saw 'bot nets used to launch 226 distributed denial-of-service attacks on 99 separate targets. These attacks bombard websites with data in an attempt to overwhelm the target. Using a 'bot net of machines spread around different networks and nations makes such attacks hard to defend against. One DDoS attack was used by one firm to knock its competitors offline. Other 'bot nets were used to abuse the Google Adsense program that rewards websites for displaying adverts from the search engine. Some networks were used to abuse or manipulate online polls and games. Criminals also seem to be starting to use 'bot nets for mass identity theft, to host websites that look like those of banks so confidential information can be gathered and to peep into online traffic to steal sensitive data. "Leveraging the power of several thousand bots, it is viable to take down almost any website or network instantly," said the researchers. "Even in unskilled hands, it should be obvious that 'bot nets are a loaded and powerful weapon." Return to results
Health authority asked to investigate pay arrangements at Central Remedial Clinic Health authority asked to investigate pay arrangements at Central Remedial Clinic The HSE has confirmed for the first time that some of the Republicâs leading hospitals â including Tallaght, the Rotunda (pictured), the National Maternity Hospital and the Coombe Womenâs Hospital â have been paying senior staff more than is permitted by the Government The HSE has confirmed for the first time that some of the Republicâs leading hospitals â including Tallaght, the Rotunda, the National Maternity Hospital and the Coombe Womenâs Hospital â have been paying senior staff more than is permitted by the Government. In a new development, the health authority has been asked to investigate whether funding from a charitable organisation linked to the Central Remedial Clinic was used to fund any unauthorised payments to senior staff. At the DÃ¡il Public Accounts Committee yesterday, it emerged that a company called the Friends and Supporters of the Central Remedial Clinic had â¬14 million at the end of 2011. Lottery funding This company, which is listed as a charity, received National Lottery funding of â¬2 million in 2011. Deputy Shane Ross said it appeared the Central Remedial Clinic had access to large sums of money at a time when it and other organisations were cutting services. The HSE gave the committee a full list of agencies deemed to not be in compliance with public pay policy last night. They include St Michaelâs House, Our Ladyâs Hospice in Dublin , Cappagh National Orthopaedic Hospital , the Royal Hospital in Donnybrook, Dublin, the Dublin Dental School and Hospital, Carriglea Cairde Services in Dungarvan , Co Waterford , and the Muiriosa Foundation . The committee yesterday began hearings into revelations around the widespread breach of public sector pay policy in voluntary hospitals and other State-funded agencies. The HSE said only seven of the 43 State-funded voluntary hospitals and health agencies were confirmed as being compliant with Government pay policy. It added that about 30 organisations were claiming to be compliant but that these assertions were now being verified as self-declarations and may not be valid.Last week the National Maternity Hospital said it remunerated its personnel âin accordance with their employment terms, with the agreement of the appropriate board sub-committees, and in full compliance with public service pay requirementsâ. Not compliant However, the HSE told the committee the hospital had confirmed to it by letter that it was not compliant. Internal Department of Health files obtained by The Online News revealed that four senior figures at the National Maternity Hospital, the master, the secretary manager, the director of nursing and the financial controller were receiving âprivately funded allowancesâ ranging from â¬30,000 to â¬45,000 on top of salary. Hospital master Dr Rhona Mahony said last week that â¬45,000 paid to her was not a âtop-upâ payment but related to professional fees from private patients . However, last night the HSE said the payments were identified as privately funded allowances because âthat was the exact description provided by the hospitalâ. Meanwhile, Our Ladyâs Hospital in Crumlin has confirmed that its chief executive was receiving an allowance funded from on-site commercial activities. It has also confirmed that neither the 2009 pension levy nor the pay cut under the Haddington Road agreement had been deducted from a â¬30,000 allowance paid to its chief executive from profits from shops. .

Heart centre at childrenâs hospital built entirely through private fundraising Heart centre at childrenâs hospital built entirely through private fundraising The facility for treating children with congenital heart conditions at Our Ladyâs Childrenâs Hospital in Crumlin was funding entirely by private donations and fundraising contributions. A purpose-built facility for treating children with congenital heart conditions has opened at Our Ladyâs Childrenâs Hospital in Crumlin. The Childrenâs Heart Centre, which includes a 25-bed dedicated infant and child cardiac unti as well as support accommodation for families and staff, was built at a cost of â¬4.5 million. The hospital treats all of Irelandâs young cardiac surgical patients, many of whom come within hours of being born. One in every 100 babies born on the island has a congenital heart defect and most require surgery. Children and their families can spend weeks, month and even up to a year in the hospital depending on the severity of their condition. The money for the new centre was raised entirely by private donations and fundraising contributions through the FixCrumlin.ie fundraising campaign. Although the hospital, along with two other Dublin childrenâs hospitals, is due to move to St Jamesâs when the new national childrenâs hospital is built, the delay in advancing this project necessitated an interim fundraising campaign at Crumlin. âOur cardiac teams deliver world class care with proven outcomes that compare favourably to UK and International standardsâ, said Dr Orla Franklin , consultant paediatric cardiologist at Crumlin. âBut our patients and their families have had to endure unacceptably inadequate conditions on wards that were built in the 1950s and 1960s. âThe moment we bring our patients through the doors on to this stunning new ward will be a very emotional one, not only for the families but for staff also.â Dr Franklin expressed gratitude to ordinary people and businesses who made donations and helped to raise the money.

Hearts 2-1 Livingston Hearts 2-1 Livingston Hearts wrapped up their Scottish Cup quarter-final tie against Livingston with two goals in the first 10 minutes. Lee Miller scored inside the opening 60 seconds, heading over Colin Meldrum and into the net from a Jamie McAllister free kick. McAllister himself scored the second when he met Saul Mikoliunas' cross at the back post to put the game beyond the visitors. Craig Easton headed in a controversial goal after an hour but Hearts held on. The opening goal came after Gus Bahoken had clumsily fouled Miller 35 yards from goal. McAllister floated the free kick into the Livi box and Miller outjumped the static visiting defence to loop his header from 10 yards over Meldrum. With just 10 minutes on the clock, the home side doubled their lead. Mikoliunas sprinted down the right, crossed to the back post where McAllister raced in to head past Meldrum. Moments later Miller came close to grabbing his second with a first-time drive from 16 yards, which skimmed the bar. Then McAllister picked up a pass from Stephen Simmons and drove an angled shot from 20 yards narrowly past Meldrum's far post. The impressive Mikoliunas twice went close before half time - a low drive was comfortably gathered by Meldrum and then he curled a left-footed shot past the keeper's right-hand post. Livi manager Richard Gough made three changes at the interval, bringing on defender Goran Stanic, midfielder Gabor Vincze, and striker Ferenc Horvath for Bahoken, Derek Lilley and Mark Wilson. But, in the opening stages of the second period, little changed. However, the West Lothian side gave themselves a lifeline with a controversial goal. Eric Deloumeaux sent Jason Dair away on the right and he tried to give the ball to McPake, who looked to be in an offside position. The Livi striker ignored the pass, however, and Dair ran on to it and played Easton in at the back post and he headed home from close range. The home side called for offside against McPake but referee Alan Freeland ignored their claims and pointed to the centre-circle. Livi went all out for the equaliser. In the 87th minute, Burton O'Brien was hauled back at the edge of the box by Neil MacFarlane, but Dair sent his shot just inches wide.

Higgins calls for models that balance sustainable growth with social inclusion Higgins calls for models that balance sustainable growth with social inclusion President Michael D Higgins used a historic appearance at Mexicoâs biggest business summit to call for new economic models that balance sustainable growth with social inclusion and ending poverty. The first European head of state to speak at the influential Cumbre de Negocios conference in Guadalajara , Mr Higgins told hundreds of Mexican businesspeople that Ireland was resolved ânot to waste the chastening experience of recession and to learn the positive lessons for the future.â The future lies ânot in returning to the failed economic path of reckless speculation and bubble economics, but to a sustainable model of nurturing talented people, creating valuable goods and services, innovating and connecting to global partners, customers, and investors in enduring ways,â he said. In a sharp critique of the policies that led to the global financial crisis, Mr Higgins said the difference between the two models was between âpursuing opportunism and embracing opportunity, between the illusion of a virtual economy and the sustainability of a real economy.â Davos of Latin America Mr Higgins spoke at the summit, known as the Davos of Latin America, where Mexicoâs president Enrique PeÃ±a Nieto was among the audience. He also met the Brazilian soccer legend PelÃ©. Economic rebalancing and a new ethical approach to business has been a common theme during the Presidentâs speeches on his tour of Latin America. Ireland and the European Union could learn from countries such as Mexico which record positive economic growth while trying to end âthe misery of extreme povertyâ through job creation. Ireland was determined to build on the Irish peopleâs âcreativity, innovation, high level of education and openness to new models,â he said in the keynote address of his visit to Mexico. âWe will not waste our energies on seeking to relive that which has failed. Invention rather than imitation has been our strength, be it in James Joyceâs Ulysses or in the new microchip from Intel , in Co Kildare,â he said in a speech delivered in English, Irish and Spanish. Ireland experienced âthe consequences of economic reversal painfully and directly â flowing simultaneously from the global financial and economic crisis, over which we had little control, and from the destructive fallout from the collapse of a domestic construction and banking bubble,â he said. âGateway to Europeâ He also encouraged Mexican companies to invest in Ireland, which offered âenormous potentialâ to companies as âa gateway to the European market,â he said. Dublin will host a conference next year for Mexican companies willing to invest in Ireland, while Mr Higgins has invited President PeÃ±a Nieto on a state visit in 2015. Mr Higgins said new policy choices must be taught to protect people from âconsequences of reckless speculative movements in economies that have rightly been labelled âfictiveâ versions of the economyâ. On a flight from Mexico City to Guadalajara on a Mexican government jet, Mr Higgins said it was clear that the economic model that will guide this century âwill not be one that is made out of the broken bits and pieces of that which has failedâ but in a real balance between economy and society.

High rate of undiagnosed HIV detected in Mater screening High rate of undiagnosed HIV detected in Mater screening Experts warn prevalence rate of almost three in every 1,000 is high by international standards A screening programme based in Dublinâs Mater hospital has detected a high rate of undiagnosed HIV infection in the capital. Nearly three in every 1,000 people who took part in the programme tested positive for HIV - a rate which is considered high by international standards. The Mater-Bronx Rapid HIV Testing (M-BRiHT) project, a collaboration between University College Dublin , the Mater and the Jacobi Medical Centre in New York, offers people attending the hospitalâs emergency department a confidential, rapid HIV test. The test is carried by using an oral swab HIV kit and takes about 30 minutes. It shows whether the body has been making antibodies to HIV, which would signal the presence of infection. Since it began late last year, 6,000 people have taken part in the programme, with 4,900 opting to be tested and 14 returning positive results. The results indicate a prevalence of HIV of 2.85 cases in every thousand taking the test, higher than the 1 in 1000 prevalence rate for which experts recommend widespread screening . Project leader Dr Ger OâConnor said: âThe results show a high HIV prevalence and also that the emergency department is an ideal setting for HIV screening if implemented in the right way.â âWe want people to know their HIV status â diagnosing HIV early helps the person with HIV to get the full benefits from treatment and also can prevent unintended onward transmission.â Patients who opt to participate in the programme watch a novel interactive counselling video, complete an on-screen survey that assesses risk behaviour. The latest national figures show there have been 315 new cases of HIV diagnosed so far this year, including six new cases last week. There has been an upsurge in the roll-out of HIV screening programmes in parallel with advances in treatment and management of the virus. Those diagnosed early who receive appropriate treatment can, according to experts, stay healthy and expect a normal lifespan. âThis has been a real ground breaking advance in HIV research and one that the whole population can help with,â said Dr Mallon , consultant in Infectious Diseases at the Mater and the principal investigator on the M-BRiHT Study. âIf we can identify those with undiagnosed HIV and help prevent them from passing on the infection, we can stop this epidemic in its tracks,â he added. The M-BRiHT project is part of a three-year research project co-ordinated through University College Dublin. The preliminary results of the programme were released today as part of the 2013 European HIV testing week. Comments are closed for this article.
Homecare provision critical for children with long-term illness Homecare provision critical for children with long-term illness Long hospital stays can cause lasting harm to children, so domestic care is key Rhona Knowles and her son Josh, at Our Ladyâs Childrenâs Hospital, Crumlin. Photograph: Eric Luke The seven infants in Our Ladyâs Hospital for Sick Children who cannot get home because of a lack of support to manage their tracheostomies are not the first to face this problem. Some two years ago The Online News reported on the case of one-year-old Molly Brennan who needed 24-hour care for a serious lung condition. She too had a tracheotomy and was at risk of cardiac arrest; however, it wasnât until her case was publicised that her mother was offered a sufficient homecare package to allow her to get home. The fact that a child requires a tracheotomy is an indication that they probably have serious heart or lung disease (or both). This may be related to congenital problems and prematurity. A tracheostomy is an artificially created opening in the front of the neck. When someone is acutely unwell in hospital it is connected to a ventilator to ensure appropriate amounts of oxygen reach the body. Afterwards, tracheostomies may be kept open to allow the person bypass the nose and mouth when breathing normally or to facilitate continued ventilation. However, they require daily care. Infection is a risk; replacement of the tube and regular suction of the airway is a must. Carers need professional support when looking after a child with a tracheostomy at home. But they also need more general support at home to allow them to devote the necessary time and attention to their sick child. Homecare packages Homecare packages are the solution. However, obtaining a suitable package has become a significant problem since funding for the health service has been severely pruned. Certainly being confined to hospital unnecessarily is neither an economic nor a humane answer. Small children react strongly to being suddenly separated from their parents. Up to 20 years or so ago, children were often alone during a hospital stay. Tears are common initially; when separation is prolonged children become passive and apathetic. However, there is now a realisation that in the past children were harmed by the experience: some felt let down by their parents, with a minority having emotional and relationship difficulties as adults. Parents in hospital Now parents are encouraged to stay with their child in hospital. However, for longer stays this may not be possible for geographic or work reasons. Some children may react badly by crying a lot, experience nightmares, refuse to eat or throw tantrums. Some may become withdrawn, especially from adults and some may even start sucking their thumbs or bed-wetting. Hospitals have psychologists who can help and play co-ordinators work in childrenâs wards. Interestingly, play co-ordinators seem to help children get better quicker and with less pain relief. The hospitalisation of a child is also stressful for parents, especially when it is a prolonged admission. High levels of stress in parents also impact on the childâs physical and mental response to their illness. There is no logical reason why children who have undergone a tracheotomy should face longer than necessary hospital stays. Getting these children home safely is a recurring need and a well-oiled system should exist to make it happen. In a properly functioning health service, a process would be in place to ensure an appropriate homecare package could be organised within days of application. It is a measure of the dysfunction of the Health Service Executive that it cannot offer such a basic service to sick children and their parents. .

Hotspot users gain free net calls Hotspot users gain free net calls People using wireless net hotspots will soon be able to make free phone calls as well as surf the net. Wireless provider Broadreach and net telephony firm Skype are rolling out a service at 350 hotspots around the UK this week. Users will need a Skype account - downloadable for free - and they will then be able to make net calls via wi-fi without paying for net access. Skype allows people to make free PC-based calls to other Skype users. Users of the system can also make calls to landlines and mobiles for a fee. The system is gaining in popularity and now has 28 million users around the world. Its paid service - dubbed Skype Out - has so far attracted 940,000 users. It plans to add more paid services with forthcoming launches of video conferencing, voice mail and Skype In, a service which would allow users to receive phone calls from landlines and mobiles. London-based software developer Connectotel has unveiled software that will expand the SMS functions of Skype, allowing users to send text messages to mobile phones from the service. Broadreach Networks has around two million users and hotspots in places such as Virgin Megastores, the Travelodge chain of hotels and all London's major rail terminals. The company is due to launch wi-fi on Virgin Trains later in the year. "Skype's success at spreading the world about internet telephony is well-known and we are delighted to be offering free access to Skype users in our hotspots," commented Broadreach chief executive Magnus McEwen-King.
IMF warns US policy may hamper growth IMF warns US policy may hamper growth Market losses on bond portfolios could reach $2.3 trillion over US debt turmoil Monetary tightening in the US could wipe trillions of dollars off bond markets, the International Monetary Fund warned yesterday. Photograph: Mark Wilson/Getty Images Monetary tightening in the US threatens to expose financial excesses and vulnerabilities that could wipe trillions of dollars off bond markets, the International Monetary Fund warned yesterday. If the Federal Reserveâs likely move to start scaling back its asset purchases or fallout from a possible US failure to lift its ceiling on public debt raise long-term interest rates by 1 percentage point, the IMFâs Global Financial Stability Report estimates that the market losses on bond portfolios could reach $2.3 trillion. Stability risks In a world of heightened financial stability risks, demonstrated by the flight to safety from emerging markets in the summer, the fund is concerned that large elements of the worldâs financial system remain vulnerable to stresses that might ensue as the extraordinary policies of the post-crisis period are scaled back. âSubstantial challengeâ Describing the process of normalising US monetary policy as âunprecedented and complexâ, JosÃ© ViÃ±als, financial counsellor to the IMF, said that âcontaining longer-term interest rates and market volatility has already proven to be a substantial challengeâ. The fund estimates the potential damage from a spike in long-term bond yields from investor fire-sales, a loss of liquidity in certain markets such as real-estate investment trusts and contagion could lead to large losses. In addition, the fundâs report warned that if the US were to default on some of its obligations after a failure to raise its debt ceiling, it âcould seriously damage the global economy and financial systemâ. â Return to results
ITunes user sues Apple over iPod ITunes user sues Apple over iPod A user of Apple's iTunes music service is suing the firm saying it is unfair he can only use an iPod to play songs. He says Apple is breaking anti-competition laws in refusing to let other music players work with the site. Apple, which opened its online store in 2003 after launching the iPod in 2001, uses technology to ensure each song bought only plays on the iPod. Californian Thomas Slattery filed the suit in the US District Court in San Jose and is seeking damages. "Apple has turned an open and interactive standard into an artifice that prevents consumers from using the portable hard drive digital music player of their choice," the lawsuit states. The key to such a lawsuit would be convincing a court that a single brand like iTunes is a market in itself separate from the rest of the online music market, according to Ernest Gellhorn, an anti-trust law professor at George Mason University. "As a practical matter, the lower courts have been highly sceptical of such claims," Prof Gellhorn said. Apple has sold more than six million iPods since the gadget was launched and has an 87% share of the market for portable digital music players, market research firm NPD Group has reported. More than 200 million songs have been sold by the iTunes music store since it was launched. "Apple has unlawfully bundled, tied, and/or leveraged its monopoly in the market for the sale of legal online digital music recordings to thwart competition in the separate market for portable hard drive digital music players, and vice-versa," the lawsuit said. Mr Slattery called himself an iTunes customer who "was also forced to purchase an Apple iPod" if he wanted to take his music with him to listen to. A spokesman for Apple declined to comment. Apple's online music store uses a different format for songs than Napster, Musicmatch, RealPlayer and others. The rivals use the MP3 format or Microsoft's WMA format while Apple uses AAC, which it says helps thwart piracy. The WMA format also includes so-called Digital Rights Management which is used to block piracy. Return to results
Ireland maintains 6th position on global gender gap list Ireland maintains 6th position on global gender gap list Iceland has least inequality among men and women out of 136 countries Among Group of 20 economies, Germany, where Angela Merkel won a third term as chancellor, ranked highest at 14th in the Global Gender Gap Report from the Global Economic Forum. Photograph: Francois Lenoir/reuters The worldâs gender gaps narrowed slightly this year, with Iceland showing the least inequality among men and women, a report by the World Economic Forum found. The Global Gender Gap Report, published yesterday, found âdefinite if not universal improvementsâ in economic equality and political participation between the sexes in the ranking of 136 countries. Of those countries measured this year and last, 86 improved, the Geneva-based WEF said in an e-mailed statement. Finland ranked second this year followed by Norway and then Sweden , unchanged from last year. Iceland has held the top spot for five years in a row. Ireland maintained its position as sixth on the list for a second year. Thanks to generous maternity leave provisions and inexpensive daycare for children, Nordic countries have high labor participation rates for women. There are two female prime ministers and two female finance ministers in that region. Norwayâs historic quota system for women on supervisory boards is being copied elsewhere in Europe : Spain , Germany , the Netherlands , France and Iceland either plan to, or have already implemented similar policies. The European Commission , the European Unionâs regulatory arm, proposed a quota system in 2012 to bring more women onto corporate boards. Limited leadership Globally, inequality remains greatest in the areas of economic equality and political participation, according to the index. First compiled in 2006, it considers economic, political, education and health-based criteria. âIn both developing and developed countries alike, relative to the numbers of women in tertiary education and in the workforce overall, womenâs presence in economic leadership positions is limited,â the WEF said in the study. Among Group of 20 economies, Germany, where Angela Merkel won a third term as chancellor, ranked highest. It dropped a place to 14th compared with 2012. South Africa ranked 17th, with the UK coming in 18th and Canada at 20th. The US was 23rd, while Russia ranked 61st, followed by Brazil at 62nd. The International Monetary Fund will push countries to publish more data on female participation in the labor market in an effort to draw attention to policies that could boost growth from Italy to Egypt , Managing Director Christine Lagarde said last month. Gap closing Nicaragua , which has now featured in the top ten for two years, was Latin Americaâs leader in closing the gender gap in the study, largely due to âpolitical empowerment.â Cuba followed at 15th, with Ecuador in 25th place. The Philippines ranked highest among countries in Asia , âdue to success in health, education and economic participation.â Chinaâs place in the ranking was unchanged at 69th, while India climbed four places to 101st, above Japan at 105th. In Africa, several countries -- Lesotho , South Africa , Burundi and Mozambique -- featured in the top 30 this year due to womenâs participation in the workforce, according to the WEF. âThrough this economic activity, women have greater access to income and economic decision-making, but are often present in low-skilled and low-paid sectors of the economy,â it said. The only region not to have improved its standing was the Middle East and North Africa, the report found. The United Arab Emirates ranked 109th, the highest-placed Arab country in the region, which achieved parity in education. Bahrain ranked 112th, with Qatar at 115th, âstill failing to adequately capitalize on the investments in education through greater economic and political contributions from women,â it said. At the bottom of the ranking were Chad (134th), Pakistan (135th) and Yemen (136th). Online News .

Ireland may not need precautionary credit to exit bailout, says Rehn Ireland may not need precautionary credit to exit bailout, says Rehn Economic and Monetary Affairs Commissioner believes Dublin could exit on its own Economic and Monetary Affairs Commissioner Olli Rehn said it was still premature to see if there is a need for any precautionary arrangement. Photographer: Andrew Harrer/Online News Ireland may not need precautionary credit to exit its bailout programme, according to EU Economic and Monetary Affairs Commissioner Olli Rehn . Mr Rehn said the reform programmes in Ireland and Spain pledged in exchange for financial support were on track and both economies were growing strongly. âWe are currently holding discussions with both countries as well as within the Eurogroup, to see what is the best way to successfully exit the programme,â he said. âThe principle that it is better to be safe than sorry prevails and we will look into what are the best ways to ensure a successful exit from the programmes.â âThanks to the economic turnaround supported by the programmes in both countries they have a very good chance of exiting the programme successfully and returning to durable market funding,â Mr Rehn, who was in Washington for talks with the IMF, said. âIt is still premature to see if there is a need for any precautionary arrangement. I would not rule it out, but, as I said, both have a very good chance in succeeding even without a precautionary arrangement,â he said. The Government has indicated it intends to seek a â¬10 billion credit buffer from Brussels to insulate it against any market shocks when the bailout expires in December. European Union officials hope that Ireland may mark the beginning of the end of the euro zoneâs debt problems if it does draw a line under its funding worries next year. Concerns about how Spainâs economy will function in an era of tighter credit and more constrained housing markets continue to weigh on the prospects for its banks and government. Some policy-makers in Brussels have said that Spain and Ireland would be wise to seek a new credit line, just in case. Even if never used, it would enable the European Central Bank to include Ireland or Spain in its programme of government bond purchases, sending a powerful signal of confidence to markets. But such credit lines would also come with conditions and further close monitoring - limiting the choices in economic policy-making that governments accept only as a last resort. Mr Rehn said that it was far too early to discuss the arrangement for Portugalâs exit from its bailout programme. Lisbonâs financial lifeline from the eurozone will end in the middle of 2014. He noted Portuguese exports and domestic demand were on the rise but said the country was still facing many challenges. Additional reporting by Online News Comments are closed for this article.
Irish doctors prescribe antibiotics for colds and flus unnecessarily, for fear of offending their pa... Irish doctors prescribe antibiotics for colds and flus unnecessarily, for fear of offending their patients, a new study has found. Dr Laura Noonan said doctors struggled with the âcultural expectationâ of prescribing something though they know it will have no impact on the symptoms of colds or flus which are caused by viruses. Dr Noonan carried out research on behalf of the Respiratory Tract Treatment Forum (RTTF) which was set up to advocate for proper use of antibiotics in primary care settings. She examined prescribing trends in rural GP practices and found many doctors were reluctant to damage the relationship with their patients by sending them home from the surgery empty-handed. âThey are worried about losing that therapeutic relationship with their patient,â she said. More than a quarter of surveyed patients felt that doctors who did not prescribe antibiotics for their colds and flu did not understand how poorly they felt. However, 57 per cent of those patients did not feel the GP were being dismissive of their symptoms. âMy study showed that GPs may also overestimate the desire of patients with colds and flus for an antibiotic,â she said.
JP Morgan in record $13 billion settlement with US authorities JP Morgan in record $13 billion settlement with US authorities US bank admits to routinely overstating quality of mortgages it was selling to investors The headquarters of JP Morgan Chase is seen in New York. The bank admitted it regularly overstated the quality of mortgages it sold to investors and agreed to pay a record $13 billion to resolve related charges. Photograph: Mike Segar/Online News JP Morgan has agreed to a record $13 billion (â¬9.6 billion) settlement after admitting it routinely overstated the quality of mortgages it was selling to investors, federal officials have said. The behaviour that the largest US bank admitted to, authorities said, is at the heart of what inflated the housing bubble: lenders making bad mortgages and selling them to investors who thought they were relatively safe. When the loans started turning bad, investors lost faith in the banking system, and a housing crisis turned into a financial crisis. The civil settlement marks the end of weeks of tense negotiations between JPMorgan Chase , which is looking to move past the legal issues that have plagued it for more than a year, and the US government, which is under pressure to hold banks accountable for behavior that led to the financial crisis. JPMorgan said it has set aside all the funds it needs to cover the settlement, meaning the deal will have no impact on its earnings. The deal resolves most of its mortgage issues with federal authorities, the bank said. JPMorganâs shares rose 0.7 per cent to close at $56.15 yesterday. But even after the settlement, the bank faces at least nine other government probes, covering everything from its hiring practices in China to whether it manipulated the Libor benchmark interest rate. It may still also face criminal charges linked to mortgage matters. The bankâs outspoken chief executive, Jamie Dimon , avoided the worst pitfalls of the financial crisis, but now is discovering he did not avoid all of them. The bank said last month it had set aside $23 billion to cover litigation expenses. Yesterday, it said it has set aside enough to cover this settlement. Meanwhile, the US justice department, which led the negotiations with JPMorgan, said that JPMorgan was not a solitary investigation. âThe justice departmentâs financial fraud investigations are far from over,â US attorney general Eric Holder said in a statement. At issue in the settlement was the long chain of parties between the original mortgage lender and the ultimate investor in the loan in the years leading up to the crisis. Often smaller lenders would make subprime mortgage loans, and sell them to a bank, which would package loans into bonds, and in turn sell them to investors. With so many middlemen, investors had poor information about what they were buying, and capital flowed to loans that arguably should never have been made. âWithout a doubt, the conduct uncovered in this investigation helped sow the seeds of the mortgage meltdown,â Mr Holder in a statement. The investors that bought these mortgage bonds demanded that the loans be of a particular quality. JPMorgan said the loans met the guidelines, but one of its employees said they did not, the bank admitted. Outside firms that reviewed some of those loans for JP Morgan in 2006 and 2007 said that 27 per cent of them did not meet underwriting guidelines, but the bank still packaged at least half of those into mortgage securities, the government said. JPMorganâs chief financial officer Marianne Lake said on a conference call that the bank did not admit to any violations of law, and does not believe the facts it admitted to have any bearing on remaining litigation. A person involved in the negotiations said the 11-page statement of fact that the bank admitted to was the subject of prolonged negotiation. Return to results
Junk e-mails on relentless rise Junk e-mails on relentless rise Spam traffic is up by 40%, putting the total amount of e-mail that is junk up to an astonishing 90%. The figures, from e-mail management firm Email Systems, will alarm firms attempting to cope with the amount of spam in their in-boxes. While virus traffic has slowed down, denial of service attacks are on the increase according to the firm. Virus mail accounts for just over 15% of all e-mail traffic analysis by the firm has found. It is no longer just multi-nationals that are in danger of so-called denial of service attacks, in which websites are bombarded by requests for information and rendered inaccessible. Email Systems refers to a small UK-based engineering firm, which received a staggering 12 million e-mails in January. The type of spam currently being sent has subtlety altered in the last few months, according to Email Systems analysis. Half of spam received since Christmas has been health-related with gambling and porn also on the increase. Scam mails, offering ways to make a quick buck, have declined by 40%. "January is clearly a month when consumers are less motivated to purchase financial products or put money into dubious financial opportunities," said Neil Hammerton, managing director of Email Systems. "Spammers seem to have adapted their output to reflect this, focussing instead on medically motivated and pornographic offers, presumably intentionally intended to coincide with what is traditionally considered to be the bleakest month in the calendar," he said.

Kerr frustrated at victory margin Kerr frustrated at victory margin Republic of Ireland manager Brian Kerr admitted he was frustrated his side did not score more than one goal in their friendly win over Croatia. Robbie Keane took his Republic record to 24 with a first-half goal which proved enough for victory. "We had more good chances. It is just a shame we did not take them against such a technically gifted team," said Kerr. "But, given the conditions and the standard of the Croatian team, we should be very happy with the win." The Republic side kept a clean sheet for the eighth time in 11 matches and are unbeaten in 14 home games since Kerr succeeded Mick McCarthy. Kerr applauded the decisive move which earned the victory. "It was a brilliant goal, fantastic skill by Damien Duff. Robbie might have scuffed it a little but it was a good goal." Matchwinner Keane was another full of praise for Duff's role in the goal. "It was great play from Damien," said the Tottenham striker. "I always try to be sniffing around because you know nine times out of 10 Duffer is going to get it in the box. "Playing three up was something different. Brian Kerr wanted to try it out and it was good to see young Stephen Elliott getting a run-out. "The conditions were difficult but he did well and is definitely one for the future. It is nice to see young players coming through." Man-of-the-match Duff explained what went wrong when he fluffed a chance to make it 2-0 midway through the second half. He opted to bring Steve Finnan's cross down and shoot against the bar when a close-range header looked the best option. "I would have headed that every time but I completely lost it in the lights," said the Chelsea star. "I was desperate to get on the scoresheet myself but the result is the important thing. "We have had a good year and are going nicely in the qualifiers. Hopefully that can continue in 2005." Return to results
Law for standardised cigarette packs moves a step closer Law for standardised cigarette packs moves a step closer Cabinet approves heads of Bill to force companies to sell cigarettes in plain cartons Chairman of the Joint Oireachtas Health Committee Jerry Buttimer (left) and Minister for Health James Reilly during a media breifing at Government Buildings where it was announced that Cabinet had approved the General Scheme for the Public Health (Standardised Packaging of Tobacco) Bill 2013. Photo: Gareth Chaney Collins Minister for Health James Reilly said he would be âastonishedâ if legislation proposing cigarettes be sold only in plain packs did not prompt legal action from the tobacco industry. He was speaking today after the Cabinet unanimously approved the heads of a Bill which will force tobacco companies to sell cigarettes in standardised cartons with graphic health warnings. The Public Health (Standardised Packaging of Tobacco) Bill 2013 will outlaw all forms of branding on cigarette packs from trademarks and logos to colours and graphics. The Bill, which will also determine the size and position of the warnings, will now be submitted for hearings by the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children for review and report. âCigarette packs have been described as the last billboard for the tobacco industry; this legislation will force the industry to show with greater clarity, the potential devastating effects of smoking on health,â Dr Reilly said. âAs it stands the tobacco companies use packets of various shapes and colours to attract young people to take up the killer habit. Standardised packaging - all the one type - with much larger warnings will be a deterrent.â So far Australia is the only country in the world to have adopted such far-reaching legislation. However, tobacco companies there have already indicated they plan to challenge the legislation under various trade, competition and intellectual property laws. Dr Reilly said other countries had pulled back from introducing tighter tobacco regulations to await the outcome of the Australian case. âAnything they can do to delay or intimidate they will do. We are not prepared to be intimidated by the tobacco industry. Weâre going to stand up for the rights of our children.â Asked if he thought the tobacco industry would mount a legal challenge here, Dr Reilly said: âIâd be astonished if they didnât, if for no other reason than to intimidate other countries from going down the same road.â Chairman of the Oireachtas Committee on Health Jerry Buttimer said the committee would meet this week and next week to discuss how it intends to handle the hearings. âThis is a public health issue, and we have at last taken a stand to eliminate the scourge of tobacco.â Under the proposed legislation, it is envisaged the cigarette brand name will be presented in a uniform typeface for all brands, and the packs will all be in one plain neutral colour. The cartons will also display graphic warnings and text about the dangers of smoking selected from a library of images and warnings developed by the European Commission .

Man Utd stroll to Cup win Man Utd stroll to Cup win Wayne Rooney made a winning return to Everton as Manchester United cruised into the FA Cup quarter-finals. Rooney received a hostile reception, but goals in each half from Quinton Fortune and Cristiano Ronaldo silenced the jeers at Goodison Park. Fortune headed home after 23 minutes before Ronaldo scored when Nigel Martyn parried Paul Scholes' free-kick. Marcus Bent missed Everton's best chance when Roy Carroll, who was later struck by a missile, saved at his feet. Rooney's return was always going to be a potential flashpoint, and he was involved in an angry exchange with a spectator even before kick-off. And Rooney's every touch was met with a deafening chorus of jeers from the crowd that once idolised the 19-year-old. Everton started brightly and Fortune needed to be alert to scramble away a header from Bent near the goal-line. But that was the cue for United to take complete control with a supreme passing display on a Goodison Park pitch that was cutting up. Fortune gave United the lead after 23 minutes, rising to meet Ronaldo's cross from eight yards after the Portuguese youngster had been allowed too much time and space by the hapless Gary Naysmith. United dominated without creating too many clear-cut chances, and they almost paid the price for not making the most of their domination two minutes before half-time. Mikel Arteta played a superb ball into the area but Bent, played onside by Gabriel Heintze, hesitated and Carroll plunged at his fee to save. United almost doubled their lead after 48 minutes when Ronaldo's low drive from 25 yards took a deflection off Tony Hibbert, but Martyn dived to save brilliantly. And Martyn came to Everton's rescue three minutes later when Rooney's big moment almost arrived as he raced clean through, but once again the veteran keeper was in outstanding form. But there was nothing Martyn could do when United doubled their lead after 57 minutes as they doubled their advantage. Scholes' free-kick took a deflection, and Martyn could only parry the ball out for Ronaldo, who reacted first to score easily. Everton's problems worsened when James McFadden limped off with an injury. And there may be further trouble ahead for Everton after goalkeeper Carroll required treatment after he was struck on the head by a missile thrown from behind the goal. Rooney's desperate search for a goal on his return to Everton was halted again by Martyn in injury-time when he outpaced Stubbs, but once again Martyn denied the England striker. - Manchester United coach Sir Alex Ferguson: "It was a fantastic performance by us. In fairness I think Everton have missed a couple of players and got some young players out. "The boy Ronaldo is a fantastic player. He's persistent and never gives in. "I don't know how many fouls he had He gets up and wants the ball again, he's truly a fabulous player." Everton: Martyn, Hibbert, Yobo, Stubbs, Naysmith, Osman, Carsley, Arteta, Kilbane, McFadden, Bent. Subs: Wright, Pistone, Weir, Plessis, Vaughan.

Microsoft seeking spyware trojan Microsoft seeking spyware trojan Microsoft is investigating a trojan program that attempts to switch off the firm's anti-spyware software. The spyware tool was only released by Microsoft in the last few weeks and has been downloaded by six million people. Stephen Toulouse, a security manager at Microsoft, said the malicious program was called Bankash-A Trojan and was being sent as an e-mail attachment. Microsoft said it did not believe the program was widespread and recommended users to use an anti-virus program. The program attempts to disable or delete Microsoft's anti-spyware tool and suppress warning messages given to users. It may also try to steal online banking passwords or other personal information by tracking users' keystrokes. Microsoft said in a statement it is investigating what it called a criminal attack on its software. Earlier this week, Microsoft said it would buy anti-virus software maker Sybari Software to improve its security in its Windows and e-mail software. Microsoft has said it plans to offer its own paid-for anti-virus software but it has not yet set a date for its release. The anti-spyware program being targeted is currently only in beta form and aims to help users find and remove spyware - programs which monitor internet use, causes advert pop-ups and slow a PC's performance.

Mourinho receives Robson warning Mourinho receives Robson warning Sir Bobby Robson has offered Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho some advice on coping under pressure. The pair worked together at Barcelona and Porto and Robson had a word of warning for his protege. "It has all gone for him just lately and that is marvellous, but sometimes you have to have a bit of humility and learn how to lose," said Robson. "It is when it goes against you and you get a bit of bad luck that you learn, and he'll get it straight." Robson was speaking after being formally granted the freedom of the city of Newcastle. "Jose is doing very well at the moment," Robson added of the man who worked for him for six years. "He has got one pot - possibly two to follow - a big game against Barcelona to come and I cannot see them losing their lead in the Premiership. "They are in a good position and I would expect them to go on and win it, which is a wonderful achievement. "What has occurred over the last couple of weeks will stand him in very good stead for the future. If he is intelligent, he will take it on board - and he is very intelligent. "He will have learned more in the last fortnight than the last eight months. Before that, it was all about winning." Robson also admitted he would relish the chance to get back into management and test his skills against Mourinho. "I am not in a hurry to take the wrong job, but I am ready to take the right job and I feel there is another job in me," he added. "I know the area I am capable of working in and of course I would like a job in the Premiership if one was available. "It would not worry me if I had to pit my wits against Jose. "But it is not just a case of him and me against one another. It would be his team against my team - but I would not be afraid of that." Return to results
Mourinho sends out warning shot Mourinho sends out warning shot Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho believes his team's Carling Cup win over Manchester United has shown they have the strength to win the Premiership. "It was important for us, not because we got into a final, but also the way we played," he said. "The mentality and the strength we showed here was a message we sent. "It is still difficult, we still have to win 11 matches to be champions but we have left a message here that we are really strong." Chelsea gave their manager a win on his 42nd birthday but Mourinho was prepared for a possible loss at Old Trafford. But the Blues are still on course for a four-pronged trophy assault as they are leading the Premiership title race and are in the FA Cup and Champions League. "We can win four, we can lose four, but it would be normal to win something. To win the four is very, very difficult but it is still possible. "There is a long way to do it but if you could give me the Premiership I would be very happy. "This is just the final though, we have not won the competition and we have to now face another great team in Liverpool." "I was ready to lose the game and leave Old Trafford with a smile just to pass a message of confidence. "But my team would never lose their confidence or mentality just because of a defeat here."

Near-record US stock market not in a bubble, says Greenspan Near-record US stock market not in a bubble, says Greenspan Former Fed chief says US economy will grow more slowly next year than expected Alan Greenspan, former Federal Reserve chairman, said the stock market is not in a bubble, even as the Dow Jones Industrial Average breached 16,000 and the Standard & Poorâs 500 has climbed above 1,800, leaving both measures at record levels. Photographer: Andrew Harrer/Online News Former US Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan said the US economy probably will grow more slowly next year than some forecasters predict and indicated that a near-record US stock market was not in a bubble. âThis does not have the characteristics, as far as Iâm concerned, of a stock market bubble,â Mr Greenspan said in an interview with Online News Television, which is due to air this weekend. âIt could come out that way but I donât see it at this stage.â Mr Greenspan said that even with the rise in equities, the US economy is restrained by a âdegree of uncertaintyâ that is reducing investment. Economists who forecast 2.5 per cent to 3 per cent growth next year may be too optimistic, he said. âItâs a little on the upside, frankly,â Mr Greenspan said. âThereâs no doubt that thereâs been some acceleration going on, but thereâs an overall suppression that is going on in the economyâ largely because of lingering uncertainty, he said. Mr Greenspan said his 2014 growth forecast is âcloser to 2 per cent.â He said the economy is being held back in part by the banking system, as some of the largest banks are not operating efficiently. âWeâre supporting banking institutions who are not only very large, but not very efficient and they are using the scarce savings of the society, which is critical for economic growth,â he said. He declined to identify which banks had become inefficient. The Standard and Poorâs 500 Index has rallied about 27 per cent this year, heading for the biggest annual gain since 1998, as the Fed has pressed on with its stimulus campaign. The S&P 500 climbed 0.2 per cent to 1,806.85 in New York yesterday, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.2 per cent to 16,097.46. Both indexes reached records this week. âThe stock price generally goes up about 7 per cent a year for the long term,â Mr Greenspan said. âIt didnât go anywhere since October 2007 and the result of that is weâre just now breaching that. We have had no growth in stock prices for years.â The S&P 500 reached 1,565.15 on October 9th, 2007, and then dropped 57 percent as the economy went through the longest and deepest recession since the Great Depression. The index didnât surpass its October 2007 peak until March of this year. Mr Greenspan also offered praise for Janet Yellen , the nominee to be the next Fed chairman. She was approved by the Senate banking committee with a vote of 14-8 on November 21st and now heads to the full Senate. Ms Yellen (67) was a governor at the Fed from 1994 to 1997 under MrGreenspan and became president of the San Francisco Fed during the final years of Mr Greenspanâs tenure, which ended in January 2006.

News that Irish people are placing an increasing emphasis on healthy eating is welcome. The Ipsos/MR... News that Irish people are placing an increasing emphasis on healthy eating is welcome. The Ipsos/MRBI poll carried out for Bord Bia this week found that over half of adults are now taking a home-made lunch to work more often than previously, while one third of respondents said they were going out to eat lunch less often. There has also been a twenty per cent drop in the last ten years in the number of people who own a deep fat fryer. And the finding that just one in twenty children in the State bring crisps to school in their lunchboxes, compared with almost one half of British children, is impressive. However the finding that 85 per cent of Irish people consider they have a healthy diet is open to challenge. At the very least it calls into question respondentsâ understanding of what constitutes a balanced, nutritious diet. It flies in the face of rising obesity figures, with the latest research showing that one in four adults here are obese. Some 45 per cent of men and 33 per cent of women in Ireland are overweight, while Ireland has the fourth highest prevalence of overweight and obesity for men in the EU. Respected and substantial ongoing research such as the Survey of Lifestyle Attitudes and Nutrition in Ireland (Slan) has consistently found a rising prevalence of overweight and obesity. And the fourth Irish Health Behaviour in School-aged Children Survey, published last month, a large study designed to examine the health of 10- to 17-year-olds, reported lower levels of physical activity compared with previous surveys. It also found a significant increase between 2002 and 2010 in the percentage of young people who reported they were on a diet. Given the time lag between behavioural change and measurable results in terms of obesity levels, the Bord Bia survey could possibly signal a turning point for the better. But we need to see hard figures from established surveys before we can signal progress on worrying levels of obesity in Ireland. .

No half measures with Half-Life 2 No half measures with Half-Life 2 Could Half-Life 2 possibly live up to the hype? After almost two years of tantalising previews and infuriating delays it's safe to say that this is the most highly-anticipated computer game of all time. Fortunately, it doesn't merely live up to its promise, but exceeds it. No-one who plays the finished product will wonder why it took so long. The impression is of a game that has been endlessly refined to get as close to perfection as could realistically be hoped. All the money - or indeed time - is on the screen. The player sees things through the eyes of Gordon Freeman, the bespectacled scientist who starred in the original 1998 Half-Life. Having survived that skirmish in an desolate monster-infested research facility, he's back in another foreboding troublespot - the enigmatic City 17. It has the look of a beautiful Eastern European city, but as soon as your train pulls in to the station, it's clear that all is not well here. Sinister police patrol the unkempt streets, and the oppressive atmosphere clobbers you like a sledgehammer. A casual smattering of the nightmarish creatures from the first game makes this an even less pleasant place to be. You are herded around like a prisoner and have to mingle with a few freedom-fighting civilians to gather information and progress in your task. It is not immediately explained what your objectives are, nor precisely why everything is so ravaged. Finding out step-by-step is all part of the experience, although you never fully get to understand what it was all about. That does not really matter. HL2 does not waste energy blinding you with plot. Underplaying the narrative in this way is gloriously effective, and immerses the player in the most vivid, convincing and impressive virtual world they are likely to have seen. There are no cut-scenes to interrupt the flow. Exposition is accomplished by other characters stopping to talk directly to you. Whereas the highly impressive Doom III felt like a top-notch theme park thrill-ride, wandering through Half-Life's world truly does feel like being part of a movie. Considering its sophistication, the game runs surprisingly well on computers that only just match the modest minimum specifications. But if ever there was an incentive to upgrade your PC's components, this is it. On our test machine - an Alienware system with an Athlon 3500+ processor and ATI's Radeon X800 video card - everything ran at full quality without trouble, and the visual experience was simply jaw-dropping. It is not simply that the surfaces, textures and light effects push the technical envelope without mercy, but that such care and artistic flair has gone into designing them. The haunting, grim landscapes become strangely beautiful. Luckily you get time to pause mid-task and marvel at the awesome graphical flourishes of your surroundings. So impressive are the physics that you'll find yourself hurling bits of rubbish around and prodding floating corpses just to marvel at the lifelike way they move. There are puzzles to be solved along the way, pitched at about the right difficulty, but most progress is achieved by force. Freeman is quickly reunited with the original game's famous crowbar, and an array of more sophisticated weapons soon follow. Virtually anything not nailed to the floor can be interacted with, and in realistic fashion. You will be wowed by the attention-to-detail as you chip bits of plaster off walls, chase a pigeon out of your way, or dodge exploding barrels as they ping around at deadly speed. At times Half-Life 2 feels like one of those annoying people who are unfeasibly brilliant at everything they turn their hand to, and in a curious way, its unrelenting goodness actually becomes almost tiresome. Running around on foot is great enough, but jumping into vehicles proves even more fun. Human foes are rendered just as well as alien ones. The stealth sections are as exhilarating as the open gun battles. In gameplay terms, HL2 somehow gets almost everything perfect. And without resorting to the zombies-leaping-out-of-shadows approach of Doom III, it's all incredibly unsettling. The vacant environment is distinctly eerie, and at one point I even caught myself hesitating to go down a murky tunnel for fear of what might be inside. The game does have a couple of problems. Firstly, the carefully-scripted way that you progress through each level might irk some people. A lot of things are meticulously choreographed to happen on cue, which makes for exciting moments, but may be an annoyance to some players and limit the appeal of playing again once you've completed it. If you like things open-ended and free-ranging, Far Cry will be a lot more pleasing. But the real downside is the hassle of getting the game to run. Installing it proved a life-draining siege that would test a saint's patience. Developer Valve has rashly assumed that everyone wanting to play the game will have an internet connection and it forces you to go online to authenticate your copy. The box does warn you of this anti-piracy measure, but does not say just how many components have to be downloaded. The time spent doing this will depend on your connection speed, the temperamental Valve servers and the time of day, but it can take hours. It would take a mighty piece of work to feel worthwhile after such annoyances - but luckily, Half-Life 2 is up to the challenge. It is surely the best thing in its genre, and possibly, many will feel, of any genre. The bar has been raised, and so far out of sight that you have to sympathise with any game that tries to do anything remotely similar in the near future. Half-Life 2 is out now for the PC Comments are closed for this article.
One million face higher health insurance, industry claims One million face higher health insurance, industry claims Health insurers call for review of tax relief cap introduced in Budget On the day of the budget, Minister for Finance Michael Noonan capped the amount of premium on which tax relief is available to â¬1,000 per adult and â¬500 per child. Photograph: Aidan Crawley Carl O'Brien, Arthur Beesley Health insurers have urged the Government to review the changes in tax relief on private health policies announced in this weekâs budget, which will raise costs for hundreds of thousands of people. The insurance companies claimed the Government had made a âfundamental miscalculationâ about the number of people affected. While Minister for Finance Michael Noonan said changes would only hit people on âgold-platedâ policies, the insurance industry last night estimated that as many as one million customers will face average increases of as much as 8 per cent, or â¬100 each. However, the Government was last night standing firm, insisting that there would be no change in policy. The move has caused confusion since it came into effect this week, with the four main insurers â VHI, Aviva, Laya and GloHealth â scrambling to change the prices of their policies overnight. Downgrading policies Some industry commentators claim the move will lead to an acceleration in numbers leaving health insurance or downgrading policies, placing increased strain on both public and private hospitals. Mr Noonan said the Revenue Commissioners had estimated in the run-up to the budget that 577,000 people would be affected â a figure endorsed by the Health Insurance Authority , the market regulator. Many of the policyholders, Mr Noonan added, would lose tax relief on only a small amount of their premiums. On budget day, Mr Noonan capped the amount of premium on which tax relief is available to â¬1,000 per adult and â¬500 per child. He said at the time this would ânot affect the majority of individuals who avail of more standard levels of medical coverâ. A spokesman for Mr Noonan last night said the policy will not be changed, but officials were willing to meet representatives of the insurance industry to discuss technical aspects of how the rate change would be implemented. In a statement, the Department of Finance said many policyholders will be only marginally affected and customers could âshop aroundâ for cheaper cover, using the Health Insurance Authorityâs website. But the authority yesterday said its website was still being updated and new premium costs would not be available for at least 24 hours. The departmentâs statement said the âvast majorityâ of families with standard premiums would not be affected by the changes and would continue to receive tax relief towards the cost of their private health insurance. It pointed out that, for example, a family of two adults and two children with a gross premium for their health insurance policy of â¬3,000 will continue to receive the tax relief at source of 20 per cent, which is worth â¬600. âProgressiveâ It said the measure was progressive in that those who pay the most for health insurance will bear the brunt of the impact. Health insurance tax relief last year cost the exchequer some â¬500 million. âIntroducing an upper ceiling on this relief is intended to ensure continuing support, via the tax system, for those who purchase standard but good policies, while reducing exchequer exposure to the more expensive policies,â the statement said. .

Online commons to spark debate Online commons to spark debate Online communities set up by the UK government could encourage public debate and build trust, says the Institute of Public Policy Research (IPPR). Existing services such as eBay could provide a good blueprint for such services, says the think-tank. Although the net is becoming part of local and central government, its potential has not yet been fully exploited to create an online "commons" for public debate. In its report, Is Online Community A Policy Tool?, the IPPR also asks if ID cards could help create safer online communities. Adopting an eBay-type model would let communities create their own markets for skills and services and help foster a sense of local identity and connection. "What we are proposing is a civic commons," Will Davies, senior research fellow at the IPPR told the Online News News website. "A single publicly funded and run online community in which citizens can have a single place to go where you can go to engage in diversity and in a way that might have a policy implication - like a pre-legislation discussion." The idea of a "civic commons" was originally proposed by Stephen Coleman, professor of e-democracy at the Oxford Internet Institute. The IPPR report points to informal, small scale examples of such commons that already exist. It mentions good-practice public initiatives like the Online News's iCan project which connects people locally and nationally who want to take action around important issues. But he adds, government could play a bigger role in setting up systems of trust for online communities too. Proposals for ID cards, for instance, could also be widened to see if they could be used online. They could provide the basis for a secure authentication system which could have value for peer-to-peer interaction online. "At the moment they have been presented as a way for government to keep tabs on people and ensuring access to public services," said Mr Davies. "But what has not been explored is how authentication technology may potentially play a role in decentralised online communities." The key idea to take from systems such as eBay and other online communities is letting members rate each other's reputation by how they treat other members. Using a similar mechanism, trust and cooperation between members of virtual and physical communities could be built. This could mean a civic commons would work within a non-market system which lets people who may disagree with one another interact within publicly-recognised rules. E-government initiatives over the last decade have very much been about putting basic information and service guides online as well as letting people interact with government via the web. Many online communities, such as chatrooms, mailing lists, community portals, message boards and weblogs often form around common interests or issues. With 53% of UK households now with access to the net, the government, suggests Mr Davies, could act as an intermediary or "middleman" to set up public online places of debate and exchange to encourage more "cosmopolitan politics" and public trust in policy. "Government already plays a critical role in helping citizens trade with each other online. "But it should also play a role in helping citizens connect to one another in civic, non-market interactions," said Mr Davies. There is a role for public bodies like the Online News, libraries, and government to bring people back into public debate again instead of millions of "cliques" talking to each other, he added. The paper is part of the IPPR's Digital Society initiative which is producing a number of conferences and research papers leading up to the publication of A Manifesto For A Digital Britain.

Only one-thrid of consumers are getting their five-a-day Only one-thrid of consumers are getting their five-a-day According to a recent consumer review from the agency safefood, only just over one-third of consumers in Ireland say they getting their five portions of fruit and veg per day. If you are looking to get more into your daily diet, Scientific Support Manager with safefood Dr Aileen McGloin offers some practical suggestions. âWhether itâs an apple or banana as a snack, salad in a lunchtime sandwich or vegetables with a main meal, there are lots of ways we can increase our portions, even by one more a day,â she says. âTinned and frozen varieties which are quick and easy to prepare are also convenient ways to have more fruit and vegetables.â Comments are closed for this article.
Overseas medics five times more likely to face fitness-to-practise if complained about Overseas medics five times more likely to face fitness-to-practise if complained about Medical Council chief executive officer Caroline Spillane said the HSE needs to put proper human resources procedures in place so that doctors who graduate outside Ireland âcan perform to the best of their ability within the health systemâ. Photograph: Dara Mac DÃ³naill Doctors from abroad, who account for a disproportionate number of Medical Council fitness-to-practise hearings, need additional support from the Health Service Executive to help them work successfully in Ireland, according to the councilâs chief executive officer. Caroline Spillane said the HSE needs to put proper human resources procedures in place so that doctors who graduate outside Ireland âcan perform to the best of their ability within the health systemâ. It needs to design and put in place âa more uniform and standardised approachâ to the recruitment, induction and supervision of international medical graduates. Ms Spillane was responding to figures that show doctors who graduated outside Ireland were five times more likely to face a fitness-to-practise inquiry if complaints were made against them compared with doctors who graduated in Ireland. Complaints Of the 322 complaints made about Irish-graduated doctors to be dealt with by the councilâs preliminary proceedings committee (PPC) last year, 23, or 7 per cent, were found to have enough evidence to be sent forward to a fitness-to-practise inquiry. But of the 91 complaints made about international medical graduates, 37 per cent or 34 complaints were found to have enough evidence to warrant a fitness-to-practise hearing. International medical graduates make up more than a third of doctors registered to work here. Complaints made against them and considered by the PPC were roughly proportionate to their numbers, at 27 per cent. But they made up 60 per cent of the complaints referred forward for a fitness-to-practise inquiry. The figures, in the Medical Councilâs annual report for 2012, were broadly similar in 2011. Ms Spillane said the phenomenon was not unique to Ireland. Each complaint made to the Medical Council was considered by the PPC on its merits and its procedures were âlegally sound, fair, transparent, and accessibleâ. The âkey thing to understandâ was the nature of the complaints, she said, and âqualitative researchâ was required to establish why more complaints about international medical graduates were going forward to full inquiries. This would be completed next year, she said. International doctors could âpotentially have difficulty in integrating into the Irish systemâ, and needed a specific level of induction, orientation and supervision, Ms Spillane said. Supervision Only 400 of the approximately 3,400 international medical graduates who came into the country between January 1st, 2011, and September 30th, 2013, were registered on the Medical Councilâs supervised division. To register a doctor in that division, the HSE had to identify the post, specify the doctorâs duties, name who would provide their supervision and have the chief executive of the hospital in question sign off on the post, Ms Spillane said.

Owen may have to return home Owen may have to return home Michael Owen has delivered the first hint that he may consider his future away from Real Madrid if he fails to get regular first-team football - and no-one can blame him. Owen displayed his world-class ability once again with another goal after coming on as a substitute in Real's win at Osasuna on Sunday. And therein lies his problem. Michael may have made a rod for his own back with his fantastic performances coming on as substitute. His many coaches at Real Madrid may have decided this is his best role. If that is the case, that is no good to him and he will be coming home sooner rather than later. Michael must hope his performances earn him a regular starting opportunity - and you can rest assured he will take that chance when it comes. I said when he was on the bench earlier this season that Michael's pride would ensure he stuck it out. He would not want to be branded a failure. But he is still on the bench and we are into February - and he could leave now and no-one could call him a flop after the terrific performances he has turned in. If and when he decides to leave, I don't think he will go elsewhere in Europe. I think he will come back to the Premiership. And there would be no shortage of takers. In an ideal world I would obviously love to see him return to Liverpool but you can rest assured that Arsenal and Chelsea would consider what Michael Owen could offer them as well. Owen is a great goalscorer but he is also a very good footballer as well. But one thing that is vital to Michael's game is sharpness - and he will know himself that you miss a vital ingredient when you are not starting games. Also Michael is a fine professional who did not sign for Real Madrid to sit on the sidelines - no matter how many Galacticos are around him. I would expect some serious interest should he fail to win a regular place. - Chelsea have given the lie to claims that they are enjoying good fortune in their quest for the title - but they will do well just to have a look in their rear-view mirror at Manchester United. Sir Alex Ferguson played the mind games by suggesting Chelsea would struggle in the north - but they've answered that one. They beat Blackburn, who didn't half put a foot in against them, and then came through a real tough one at Everton, albeit aided by James Beattie's sending off. Chelsea have done brilliantly and you do not keep clean sheets like they do by luck alone. But all Manchester United can do is keep up the pressure - and boy are they doing that. No team has ever been better at chasing down the leaders than Manchester United. Ferguson's team will stay totally committed to the cause. It is still very much Chelsea's to lose and they have shown they can battle as well as play exhilarating football, so the odds must be on them. But the old Liverpool saying was that you have never won the title until the medal is in your hand - and United will still have their sights set on snatching them away from Chelsea. The big talking point of the weekend was Beattie's sending off for Everton against Chelsea. I've got to confess, I've never seen anything like that. I can't defend the lad or condone it but you can almost see how it has happened. He has come out fired up but it's all gone wrong. It was right in front of the referee and it's the most straightforward red you'll ever see. It gave Chelsea a crucial advantage - and it was one they took advantage of in a very professional manner.

Parry relishes Anfield challenge Parry relishes Anfield challenge Online News Sport reflects on the future for Liverpool after our exclusive interview with chief executive Rick Parry. Chief executive Parry is the man at the helm as Liverpool reach the most crucial point in their recent history. Parry has to deliver a new 60,000-seat stadium in Stanley Park by 2007 amid claims of costs spiralling above Â£120m. He is also searching for an investment package of a size and stature that will restore Liverpool to their place at European football's top table. But it is a challenge that appears to sit easily with Parry, who has forged a reputation as one of football's most respected administrators since his days at the fledgling Premier League. Liverpool have not won the championship since 1990, a fact that causes deep discomfort inside Anfield as they attempt to muscle in on the top three of Chelsea, Manchester United and Arsenal. Throw in the small matter of warding off every top club in world football as they eye captain Steven Gerrard, and you can see Parry is a man with a lot on his plate. But in the comfort of a conference room deep inside Liverpool's heartbeat - The Kop end - Parry spoke to us with brutal honesty about the crucial months ahead. He only dodged one question - when asked to reveal the name of the mystery investor currently courting Liverpool, a polite smile deflected the inquiry. But to his credit, he met everything else head on in measured tones that underscore the belief that Liverpool still mean business. By business he means becoming title challengers again, and locking the pieces together that will help return the trophy to Liverpool is Parry's mission. Parry has already successfully put one of those planks in place in the form of new manager Rafael Benitez. And his enthusiasm for the Spaniard's personality and methods is an indication of his clear feeling that he has struck gold. Benitez's early work has given Parry renewed optimism about the years ahead. But it remains a massive task at a club with a unique history and expectations. This will not come as news to Parry, a lifelong Liverpool supporter, but his quiet determination suggests he is no mood to be found wanting... Captain Gerrard is central to Liverpool's plans and Parry's insistence that all offers will be refused is a firm statement of intent. As ever, the player will have the final say, and Parry acknowledges that, but he is determined to provide the framework and environment for Liverpool and Gerrard to flourish. In terms of the search for new investment, Hawkpoint were appointed as advisors to flush out interest in March 2004. Thailand Prime Minister Thaksin Shiniwatra came and went, while the most serious statement of intent came from tycoon and lifelong fan Steve Morgan. Morgan had a succession of bids rejected, having come close in the summer only for talks to break down over potential costs for the new stadium. Online News Sport understands Morgan is still ready and willing to invest in Liverpool, and Parry has kept the door ajar despite currently seeking investment elsewhere. Morgan, however, has had no formal contact with Liverpool or their advisors since last December, blaming indecision at board level as he publicly withdrew his Â£70m offer. He was also convinced his interest was being used to lure in others, so any new approach would now have to come from Liverpool. Morgan will certainly not be making another call. So speculation continues about the new benefactor, with trails leading to the Middle East and America, but all met with an understandable veil of secrecy from Anfield. Parry meanwhile sees the new ground as crucial to Liverpool's future, but is refusing to become emotionally attached to the idea. He is determined the ground will only be built on an affordable basis and will not make future Liverpool management hostages to the new stadium. Parry will pull back the moment the figures do not stack up, but there has been a vital new development in North London that has re-shaped Liverpool's thinking. Liverpool have publicly refused to entertain the idea of stadium sponsorship and potential naming rights - but the realism of Arsenal's stunning Â£100m deal for their new Emirates Stadium at Ashburton has changed the landscape. Parry labelled the deal "an eye-opener" and admits Liverpool would be missing a trick not to explore the possibilities. He knows some traditionalist Liverpool fans will reel at any attempt to call the new stadium anything other than just 'Anfield', but the maths of modern-day football decree that multi-millions for stadium and team could ease the pain. I would take Â£50m if we had no investment, but if we did, keep him. As for the stadium, if it gets us cash what difference does it make really? Â£50m for Gerrard? I don't care who you are, the Directors would take the money and it is the way it should be. We cannot let that sum of money go, despite Gerrard's quality. Through a cleverly worded statement, the club has effectively forced Gerrard to publicly make the decision for himself, which I think is the right thing to do. Critical time for Liverpool with regards to Gerrard. Ideally we would want to secure his future to the club for the long term. I am hoping he doesn't walk out of the club like Michael Owen did for very little cash. Â£50m realistically would allow Rafa to completely rebuild the squad, however, if we can afford to do this AND keep Gerrard we will be better for it. I would however be happy with Gerrard's transfer for any fee over Â£35m. Parry's statements are clever in that any future Gerrard transfer cannot be construed as a lack of ambition by the club to not try and keep their best players. Upping the ante is another smart move by Parry. I would keep Gerrard. No amount of money could replace his obvious love of the club and determination to succeed. The key is if Gerrard comes out and says that he is happy. Clearly, if he isn't, then we would be foolish not to sell. The worrying thing is who would you buy (or who would come) pending possible non-Champions League football. Return to results
People caring for those with dementia are under such a high level of ongoing stress their own cognit... People caring for those with dementia are under such a high level of ongoing stress their own cognitive function may be impaired, and they may even be at risk of developing dementia themselves at a later stage. A new three-year study by researchers at Trinity College Dublinâs Institute for Neuroscience will study the stress levels and cognitive function of carers of partners with Alzheimerâs disease and dementia. The researchers are looking to recruit 300 participants over the age of 50 for the De-Stress project which is being conducted by TCDâs Neuro-Enhancement for Independent Lives (NEIL) programme. Prof Brian Lawlor, Clinical Director of NEIL said he expected the study to show a subtle degree of impairment in carers over time. âMany caregivers are older people themselves and we already know that caring is hugely stressful. By understanding the effects of caregiving on cognitive functioning, we can think about how to develop novel interventions,â he sais.

Plymouth 3-0 Sheff Utd Plymouth 3-0 Sheff Utd Plymouth claimed their first win of the year with goals from Graham Coughlan, Paul Wotton and Dexter Blackstock. However, Sheffield United's cause was not helped when they were forced to replace injured keeper Paddy Kenny with midfielder Phil Jagielka on 28 minutes. By that stage the visitors were already one down, Coughlan converting Tony Capaldi's cross with a fierce volley. Wotton beat Jagielka from 25 yards out after the break before Blackstock headed home Peter Gilbert's cross. - Plymouth manager Bobby Williamson said: "We had our luck tonight because their keeper got injured which was unfortunate for them. "But we'd also got an early goal while he was on and that lifted everybody. "I'm delighted that we bounced back from Saturday and our heavy defeat at West Ham and that our sequence without a win is now over." - Sheffield United boss Neil Warnock said: "We expected a tough match and it wasn't pretty. "Plymouth are fighting for their lives, and we knew they would come at us from the off and then to lose your goalkeeper is a blow to any team. "We hung on till half-time but Plymouth scored early in the second half."

Reds sink 10-man Magpies Reds sink 10-man Magpies Titus Bramble's own goal put Liverpool on the comeback trail as injury-hit Newcastle were well beaten at Anfield. Patrick Kluivert's close-range finish put Newcastle ahead after 31 minutes, but they were pegged back as Bramble headed in Steven Gerrard's corner. Neil Mellor gave Liverpool the lead before half-time from Milan Baros' pass before the Czech added a third after rounding Shay Given on the hour. Newcastle then had Lee Bowyer sent off for two bookable offences. Liverpool brought back Luis Garcia after a hamstring injury, while Newcastle were forced to draft in Kluivert after Craig Bellamy was a late withdrawal with a back injury sustained in the warm-up. And Garcia should have crowned his return with a goal inside the opening minute when he took a pass from Baros but shot wildly over the top from eight yards. Olivier Bernard was only inches away from giving Newcastle the lead after 20 minutes, when he fired just wide from a free-kick 25 yards out. But Souness's side did go ahead 11 minutes later in highly controversial circumstances. Kluivert looked suspiciously offside when Kieron Dyer set Bowyer free, but the Dutchman was then perfectly placed to score from six yards. The lead lasted three minutes, with Liverpool back on terms as Bramble headed Gerrard's corner into his own net under pressure from Sami Hyypia. And Liverpool were ahead after 37 minutes when Baros slid a perfect pass into Mellor's path for the youngster to slip a slide-rule finish into Given's bottom corner. Garcia's finishing was wayward, and he was wasteful again in first-half injury time, shooting tamely at Given after good work by Xabi Alonso. Any hopes of a Newcastle recovery looked to be snuffed out on the hour when a brilliant turn and pass by Harry Kewell set Baros free and he rounded Given to score. Jermaine Jenas then missed a glorious chance to throw Newcastle a lifeline, shooting over from just eight yards out from Shola Ameobi's cross. Then Bowyer, who had already been booked for a foul on Alonso, was deservedly shown the red card by referee Graham Poll for a wild challenge on Liverpool substitute Florent Sinama-Pongolle.

Reviews found 6,300 ineligible for discretionary medical cards Reviews found 6,300 ineligible for discretionary medical cards Health chiefs say no change in policy in relation to awarding process Department of Health secretary general Ambrose McLoughlin said medical card application processing was now carried out on an equitable and consistent basis using standard operating procedures. More than 6,300 people who previously held discretionary medical cards were found to be ineligible following reviews carried out this year, HSE officials have told the Public Accounts Committee . Health service chiefs insisted that there had been no change in policy in relation to the awarding of medical cards. Department of Health secretary general Ambrose McLoughlin said that, as a result of the introduction of a centralised system, application processing was now carried out on an equitable and consistent basis using standard operating procedures. âPreviously different approaches may have been used in different parts of the country resulting in inequitable distribution of discretionary cards.â Comments are closed for this article.
Satellite mapping aids Darfur relief Satellite mapping aids Darfur relief Aid workers trying to house, feed and clothe millions of homeless refugees in the Sudanese region of Darfur are getting a helping hand from advanced mapping technology. A European consortium of companies and university groups known as Respond is working to provide accurate and up to date maps. The aim is to overcome some of the huge logistical challenges in getting supplies to where they are needed. Respond is using satellite imagery to produce accurate maps that can be used in the field rapidly. "Respond has produced very detailed maps for example for the road networks, for the rivers and for the villages, to more large-scale maps useful for very general planning purposes," said Einar Bjorgo from Unosat, the UN satellite mapping organisation that is part of the Respond consortium. The group uses satellites from Nasa, the European Space Agency and the Disaster Monitoring Constellation. The satellite data is transmitted to ground stations. From there, the information makes its way to Respond organisations that specialise in interpreting such data. "You have to convert the data into images, then the interpreter has to convert all this into crisis, damage, or situation maps," said Stefan Voigt, who works in the remote sensing department of one of those organisations, the German Aerospace Centre. This kind of detailed analysis usually takes a couple of months but Respond gets it done in about 12 hours. "Our users are usually not so much familiar with reading satellite imagery, reading satellite maps, so it's our task to transfer the data into information that non-technical people can read and understand easily and very, very efficiently," said Mr Voigt. Respond supplies maps to aid groups via the web, and on compact disc. But the best map is one you can hold in your hands, especially in remote areas where internet connections and laptops are scarce. "A map is a working document," explains Herbert Hansen of Respond's Belgian partner Keyobs. "You need to use it, you need to write on it, correct, give feedback and so on, so you need paper to write on. "We print maps, we laminate the maps, we encapsulate the maps if needed so you can take a shower with the map, it's completely protected." Humanitarian groups in Darfur have been making good use of Respond's maps. They have come in especially handy during Sudan's rainy season, when normally dry riverbeds, or wadis, became flooded. "These wadis had a very small amount of flooding, generally, in terms of depth, but greatly impeded the transport capabilities and capacities of the humanitarian groups on the ground," says Stephen Candillon of Respond imaging partner Sertit. Respond's rapid imaging has allowed aid groups to find ways around the wadis, allowing then to mark on their maps which roads were washed out at which times. Aid groups say that combination of satellite technology and on-the-ground observation helped keep relief flowing to those who needed it.

Savita death must mean better maternity staffing - INMO chief Savita death must mean better maternity staffing - INMO chief INMO to devote all resources to ensuring âonly positive things emerge from this tragedyâ If given a chance by policy makers, midwives could âlead on new models of careâ, INMO president Claire Mahon has said. Photograph: Cyril Byrne/The Online News The death of Savita Halappanavar must result in better staffing of maternity units, the president of the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation (INMO) has said. Addressing the INMO and Royal College of Midwives of Northern Ireland joint midwifery conference in Dublin this morning, INMO president Claire Mahon told delegates Ms Halappanavarâs death formed a backdrop to the conference. Welcoming the national review of maternity services proposed in the recent Health Information Equality Authority (Hiqa) review into Ms Halappanavarâs death, Ms Mahon said the INMO would âdevote all of the resources necessary to ensure that only positive things emerge from this tragedyâ. She said the three reports into Ms Halappanavarâs death âplaced a very sharp light on staffing levels and standards of care in all maternity servicesâ. She said improved standards of care in all maternity units must involve adequate staffing levels, an appropriate skill mix and âabsolute clarity that midwife managers have the authority and the autonomy to ensure adequate resources are always available to ensure and guarantee safe practice and safe careâ. If given a chance by policy makers, midwives could âlead on new models of careâ, Ms Mahon said. She said this should begin with the establishment of new midwifery-led units for low-risk mothers without delay. She said the evidence from such units in Louth and Cavan proved the service was preferred by mothers and delivered high quality, cost-effective care. Ms Mahon said the INMO was currently âactively supportingâ members working in the maternity unit at University College Hospital, Galway where Ms Halappanavar died. She said âmuch learningâ had to be taken from her death. âHopefully, out of this very dark situation, there will be a marked improvement in the level of resources available to all maternity services on the island of Ireland.â Return to results
Sharp jump in data reflects element of âcatch upâ, says economist Sharp jump in data reflects element of âcatch upâ, says economist âDespite a mooted recovery in the housing market, mortgage lending continues to slide, falling by 2.3%.â Consumer confidence hit a six-year high this month, propelled by positive news in the jobs and property markets. However, Irish households remain risk-averse, with data showing that borrowing continues to fall as consumers use available funds to repay debt. The KBC Bank Ireland/ESRI consumer sentiment index rose to 73.1 in September from 66.8 in August, reaching its highest level since 2007. The index of current economic conditions also improved to 86.0 in September from 83.3 in August, the fifth consecutive monthly increase. The index also found that positive views on the economic outlook exceeded negative views for the first time since February 2006. âSeptemberâs survey reveals growing confidence amongst consumers, with improvements compared to September last year and August this year,â said Kevin Timoney of the ESRI. KBC economist Austin Hughes said the size of the rise in consumer sentiment in September was surprising, but broadly consistent with a gradually improving trend in confidence of late. However, he warned that the improvement reflected an element of âcatch-upâ in sentiment as opposed to any dramatic change in the economic environment. Borrow less Indeed, despite the boost in sentiment, data from the Central Bank shows that Irish households continue to borrow less, with lending down 4.3 per cent in the year to August 2013. And, despite a mooted recovery in the housing market, mortgage lending continues to slide, falling by 2.3 per cent. In August, Irish households repaid more than they borrowed to the tune of â¬411 million, a development due mainly to the â¬234 million decrease in mortgages. Alan McQuaid, economist with Merrion Stockbrokers, said the figures showed little progress in terms of advancing loans to households. âAs a result this will severely hamper the overall recovery prospects for the housing market and the Irish economy as a whole, and keep the unemployment rate higher than it would otherwise be.â Lending to Irish businesses also fell during the period under review, down by 4.4 per cent, following a decrease of 4.8 per cent in July. And while households are borrowing less, this does not correspond to an increase in saving. According to the Central Bank, household deposits fell by 0.4 per cent in the 12 months to August. International markets Meanwhile, additional data from the Central Bank shows that Irish banks continue to retrench from international markets. In the second quarter of 2013, foreign claims fell by 6 per cent to almost â¬100 billion. âThe annual reduction in total foreign claims is expected given that the domestic banking groups continue to downsize their operations abroad,â according to the Central Bank.

Sociedad set to rescue Mladenovic Sociedad set to rescue Mladenovic Rangers are set to loan out-of-favour midfielder Dragan Mladenovic to Real Sociedad, despite the closure of the January transfer window. Sociedad have been given special permission by the Spanish FA to sign a player due to an injury crisis. Mladenovic will effectively replace former Rangers midfielder Mikel Arteta, who has been loaned to Everton. Sociedad say they will pay Rangers Â£150,000, with an option to buy the Serbia & Montenegro international. Mladenovic's loan move is subject to him passing a medical. The 28-year-old, who joined Rangers from Red Star Belgrade for Â£1.2m in the close season, is expected in San Sebastian later this week following his national side's game against Bulgaria. Sociedad are in 15th place in the 20-strong Primera Liga, just two points above the relegation zone. Special permission from the Spanish FA came after an injury to central defender Igor Jauregi. The versatile Mladenovic can also play in the back four. His agent said last month that Rangers had told him to find the player a new club. Mladenovic's time at Ibrox has been plagued with injury and he has made just six starts in six months with the Glasgow club. Comments are closed for this article.
Spain coach faces racism inquiry Spain coach faces racism inquiry Spain's Football Federation has initiated disciplinary action against national coach Luis Aragones over racist comments about Thierry Henry. If found guilty Aragones could lose his job or face a fine of about Â£22,000. The federation had initially declined to take action against Aragones after comments he made during a national team training session in October. But its president Angel Maria Villar changed his mind after a request by Spain's anti-violence commission. Aragones insisted the comments, made to Henry's Arsenal club-mate Jose Antonio Reyes, were meant to motivate the player, and were not intended to be offensive. "I never intended to offend anyone, and for that reason I have a very easy conscience," he said at the time. "I'm obliged to motivate my players to get the best results. "As part of that job, I use colloquial language, with which we can all understand each other within the framework of the football world. " England's players made a point of wearing anti-racism t-shirts when training before their friendly against Spain in Madrid last month. But the storm increased following racist chanting by Spanish fans at England's black players during the game, which Spain won 1-0. Spain's minister of sport Jaime Lissavetzky was quick to give his backing to the Federation's decision. "Everyone who has a public function has to consider their declarations, and make sure they do not give a negative image," he said. "We are going to have zero tolerance in questions of racism."

Study finds popular cholesterol-lowering medication has no link to memory loss Study finds popular cholesterol-lowering medication has no link to memory loss Statins are one of the most commonly prescribed classes of drugs. Photo: Getty Images/iStockphoto Cholesterol-lowering statin drugs pose no threat to short-term memory and may protect against dementia if used over a long period, according to a review of research evidence. Scientists who pooled data from 16 robust studies found that taking statins for more than a year cut the risk of dementia by 29 per cent. Questions about the drugsâ effects on the brain last year led the US Food and Drug Administration to order new medicine labels warning of possible memory problems linked to statins. But the new findings suggest such fears are not justified, and statins may actually help to safeguard the brain. Dr Kristopher Swiger , from Johns Hopkins Medicine in Baltimore, US, said: âAll medications, including statins, may cause side effects, and many patients take multiple medicines that could theoretically interact with each other and cause cognitive problems. âHowever, our systematic review and meta-analysis of existing data found no connection between short-term statin use and memory loss or other types of cognitive dysfunction. In fact, longer-term statin use was associated with protection from dementia.â The researchers conducted two different analyses. One looked at the impact of short term statin use on brain function, while the other examined how taking the drugs long term related to Alzheimerâs disease or vascular dementia. The findings are published online in the journal Mayo Clinic Proceedings. Co-author Dr Raoul Manalac , also from Johns Hopkins Medicine, said: âOur goal was to provide clarity on this issue based on the best available evidence. âWe looked at high-quality, randomised controlled trials and prospective studies that included more than 23,000 men and women with no prior history of cognitive problems. The participants in those studies were followed for up to 25 years.â Statins lower levels of âbadâ cholesterol, or low-density lipoprotein (LDL) in the blood. LDL contributes to the build up of plaque deposits that narrow blood vessels in the brain as well as the heart.The drugs have been shown to reduce inflammation within blood vessels and the risk of stroke-inducing blood clots. - Press Association Return to results
Sun offers processing by the hour Sun offers processing by the hour Sun Microsystems has launched a pay-as-you-go service which will allow customers requiring huge computing power to rent it by the hour. Sun Grid costs users $1 (53p) for an hour's worth of processing and storage power on systems maintained by Sun. So-called grid computing is the latest buzz phrase in a company which believes that computing capacity is as important a commodity as hardware and software. Sun likened grid computing to the development of electricity. The system could mature in the same way utilities such as electricity and water have developed, said Sun's chief operating officer Jonathan Schwartz. "Why build your own grid when you can use ours for a buck an hour?" he asked in a webcast launching Sun's quarterly Network Computing event in California. The company will have to persuade data centre managers to adopt a new model but it said it already had interest from customers in the oil, gas and financial services industries. Some of them want to book computing capacity of more than 5,000 processors each, Sun said. Mr Schwartz ran a demonstration of the service, showing how data could be processed in a protein folding experiment. Hundreds of servers were used simultaneously, working on the problem for a few seconds each. Although it only took a few seconds, the experiment cost $12 (Â£6.30) because it had used up 12 hours' worth of computing power. The Sun Grid relies on Solaris, the operating system owned by Sun. Initially it will house the grid in existing premises and will use idle servers to test software before shipping it to customers. It has not said how much the system will cost to develop but it already has a rival in IBM, which argues that its capacity on-demand service is cheaper than that offered by Sun. Return to results
Tax revenues up 2.9%, exchequer returns show Tax revenues up 2.9%, exchequer returns show Minister for Finance Michael Noonan and Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform Brendan Howlin at a press conference today outlining the third quarter exchequer returns. Photograph: Frank Miller / The Online News Minister for Finance Michael Noonan has said the budgetary adjustment will be âsomewhat lessâ than the â¬3.1 billion recommended by the troika. However, he said he would only reveal by how much on Budget day. âWe think we can do it somewhat less than the â¬3.1 billion, but we still have a lot of number crunching to do to see where we come in.â Mr Noonan was speaking as the exchequer returns for first nine months of the year showed tax revenues were exactly on target, while spending was running below expectations. The figures, which are expected to be central to the Cabinetâs budgetary deliberations, suggest the Government will realise its main fiscal targets for 2013. The exchequer deficit at the end of September now stands at â¬7.1 billion, some â¬4 billion lower than at the same stage last year. The figures showed that tax revenues were up 2.9 per cent (or â¬768 million) on last year. Income tax, the largest single source of revenue for the exchequer, raised â¬10.8 billion in the first nine months of the year. This was â¬81 million (or 0.7 per cent) below target. However, the department attributed the slight underperformance to weaker-than-expected receipts from the Deposit Interest Retention Tax (Dirt), linked to lower interest being earned on cash on deposit in banks. VAT receipts for the period totalled â¬8.4 billion, which represents a shortfall of â¬165 million (1.9 per cent) against target, reflecting weak retail sales. However, the department said VAT receipts had picked up substantially in July and August on account of the good weather and the new seasonal pattern of car sales. VAT receipts for September were â¬1.6 billion, which was â¬80 million or 5.2 per cent ahead of the departmentâs monthly target. The shortfall in income tax and VAT was largely offset by a better-than-expected performance in corporation tax, which came in â¬239 million (10 per cent) ahead of the â¬2.4 billion target for the nine-month period. Local Property Tax receipts also boosted Government coffers, netting the exchequer â¬ 200 million so far this year, which was â¬ 80 million or 66.6 per cent ahead of target. Net voted expenditure was 2.7 per cent below target, at â¬31.6 billion, at the end of the period, and 4.9 per cent down year-on-year. The Government is committed to ensuring Budget 2014 delivers a general government deficit of no greater than 5.1 per cent of GDP next year. âAs well as implementing the bailout programme, we have to politically manage it and grow the economy at the same time,â Mr Noonan said.

Text messages aid disaster recovery Text messages aid disaster recovery Text messaging technology was a valuable communication tool in the aftermath of the tsunami disaster in Asia. The messages can get through even when the cell phone signal is too weak to sustain a spoken conversation. Now some are studying how the technology behind SMS could be better used during an emergency. Sanjaya Senanayake works for Sri Lankan television. The blogging world, though, might know him better by his online name, Morquendi. He was one of the first on the scene after the tsunami destroyed much of the Sri Lankan coast. Cell phone signals were weak. Land lines were unreliable. So Mr Senanayake started sending out text messages. The messages were not just the latest news they were also an on-the-ground assessment of "who needs what and where". Blogging friends in India took Mr Senanayake's text messages and posted them on a weblog called Dogs without Borders. Thousands around the world followed the story that unfolded in the text messages that he sent. And that's when Mr Senanayake started to wonder if SMS might be put to more practical use. "SMS networks can handle so much more traffic than the standard mobile phone call or the land line call," he says. "In every rural community, there's at least one person who has access to a mobile phone, or has a mobile phone, and can receive messages." Half a world away, in the Caribbean nation of Trinidad and Tobago, Taran Rampersad read Morquendi's messages. Mr Rampersad, who used to work in the military, knew how important on the ground communication can be in times of disaster. He wondered if there might be a way to automatically centralise text messages, and then redistribute them to agencies and people who might be able to help. Mr Rampersad said: "Imagine if an aid worker in the field spotted a need for water purification tablets, and had a central place to send a text message to that effect. "He can message the server, so the server can send out an e-mail message and human or machine moderators can e-mail aid agencies and get it out in the field." He added: "Or, send it at the same time to other people who are using SMS in the region, and they might have an excess of it, and be able to shift supplies to the right places." Mr Rampersad and others had actually been thinking about such a system since Hurricane Ivan ravaged the Caribbean and the southern United States last September. Last week, he sent out e-mail messages asking for help in creating such a system for Asia. In only 72 hours, he found Dan Lane, a text message guru living in Britain. The pair, along with a group of dedicated techies, are creating what they call the Alert Retrieval Cache. The idea is to use open-source software - software can be used by anyone without commercial restraint - and a far-flung network of talent to create a system that links those in need with those who can help. "This is a classic smart mobs situation where you have people self-organizing into a larger enterprise to do things that benefit other people," says Paul Saffo, a director at the California-based Institute for the Future. "You may be halfway around the world from someone, but in cyberspace you're just one click or one e-mail away," he said, "That's put a whole new dimension on disaster relief and recovery, where often people halfway around the world can be more effective in making something happen precisely because they're not right on top of the tragedy." It is still very early days for the project, though. In an e-mail, Dan Lane calls it "an early proof of concept." Right now, the Alert Retrieval Cache can only take a text message and automatically upload it to a web-page, or distribute it to an e-mail list. In the near future, the group says it hopes to take in messages from people in affected areas, and use human moderators to take actions based on the content of those messages. But there's still another challenge. You have to get people to know that the system is there for them to use. "It's amazing how difficult it is to find someone to pass it along to, and say, look this is what we're trying to do and everything like that," says Mr Rampersad. "So the big problem right now is the same problem we're trying to solve - human communication." He is optimistic, however. He thinks that the Alert Retrieval Cache is an idea whose time has come and he hopes governments, too, will sit up and take notice. And he stands by his motto, courtesy of Michelangelo: criticise by creating. Clark Boyd is technology correspondent for The World, a Online News World Service and WGBH-Boston co-production.

The seventh austerity budget since 2008 â and this Governmentâs third â contained further pain for c... The seventh austerity budget since 2008 â and this Governmentâs third â contained further pain for citizens and an erosion in public services and entitlements. But it also offered the prospect of economic growth with an unexpectedly large job creation programme taking centre stage. It reflected a careful balancing act as the Government, encumbered by the highest deficit within the EU, attempted to bolster public confidence while preparing to exit its bailout programme. There was no silver bullet to deal with past excesses, just a slow grind of incremental change as costs were pared back and established entitlements were stripped away. Budget 2014 was no longer about funding a bank bailout but about bringing public expenditure more into line with government income. The unstated hope was that accelerating economic growth in the coming years would increase exchequer income and close the deficit gap. A great deal has changed. Time was when excitement was generated when a minister for finance held up a briefcase. Now, the positioning of crash barriers outside the DÃ¡il fulfils that role while public expectations have become sharply negative. The budget date has been moved to October, allowing for an examination of public expenditure programmes before the money is actually spent. This approach, as Minister for Public Expenditure Brendan Howlin put it, will be âthe new normalâ and part of a political reform programme. But some things never change, such as the taxation of âold reliablesâ. In that regard, Minister for Finance Michael Noonan announced a 10c rise in excise duties on a pint of beer and on a packet of cigarettes â 50c went on a bottle of wine. There was plenty to complain about in the speeches made by Mr Noonan and Mr Howlin. And Fianna FÃ¡ilâs Michael McGrath didnât disappoint. Having accepted the need to cut the deficit by â¬2.5 billion, he focused on what he regarded as the âdisproportionate burdenâ that had been placed on those least able to bear it. He wasnât happy about a whole range of issues, however, while SeÃ¡n Fleming concentrated on the shabby treatment of the elderly and disabled. Sinn FÃ©inâs Pearse Doherty quoted W B Yeats and complained Mr Noonan had âdried the marrowâ from the bones of the Irish people, while taunting Labour ministers about cuts, âone hundred years after the Lockoutâ. There is something of a wing and a prayer about this Budget as it attempts to rebuild public confidence and accelerate economic growth. Cuts are smaller than originally envisaged and planned expenditure greater. More than 1,000 additional teachers, gardaÃ­ and health workers will be employed. Some â¬500m will be invested in job creation. There are weaknesses and imbalances but the formula could work if international circumstances begin to match our growth profile.

The wonder of Ronaldinho The wonder of Ronaldinho Ronaldinho has the most famous smile in football - but it is the grins his incredible talent has put on the faces of fans that ensured he picked up the World Player of the Year award on Monday night. The Brazilian landed the prize ahead of strikers Thierry Henry of Arsenal and AC Milan's Andriy Shevchenko after a year in which his dancing feet dazzled defenders and delighted fans. Henry and Shevchenko led their clubs to the league titles in England and Italy while Ronaldinho ended last season trophy-less. But while Ronaldinho's achievements may not have won him any medals, they have won him the hearts of a football world. He has turned despair into delight at Barcelona since deciding to move to the Nou Camp instead of Manchester United and, in the process, brought a joy back to the sport. Barcelona were an ailing club thirsty for former glories to be restored as they hung heavily in the shadows of the "galacticos" of arch-rivals Real Madrid. But the arrival of Ronaldinho in July 2003 has spearheaded a rapid rise which now sees the Catalan club playing the kind of flamboyant football encapsulated by the dashing skills of their playmaker and inspiration. He has fans on the edge of their seats as they wonder what marvels the boy from Brazil will produce to amaze them. Ronaldinho's magic rarely disappoints and, while he possesses all the feints, step-overs, shoulder-drops and vision one could wish for, he also has the crucial ability of complementing his skills with an end product. His victory in Fifa's annual vote may be hard for Henry and Shevchenko, who have amazed with their exploits, but Ronaldinho just has that little extra va-va voom. Ronaldinho can add the award to the World Cup winners medal he earned with Brazil at the 2002 World Cup and the 1999 Copa America title. Ronaldinho - full name Ronaldo de Assis Moreira - has come a long way from his humble origins in Porto Allegre, where he was spotted by his hometown club Gremio at the age of 18. His flamboyance and vision was a key factor as Brazil won the World under-17 title in 1997, and in 1999 he captured the attention of then-Brazil coach Wanderley Luxemburgo with 15 goals in 14 matches for Gremio. Ronaldinho made his international debut that year and announced himself on the world stage with a sensational solo effort against Venezuela in the Copa America, which Brazil went on to win. A protracted transfer saga saw him move to Paris St Germain where his relationship with the French club was far from harmonious, and coach Luis Fernandez was not amused when he turned up late following a trip home at Christmas. There was also discontent about the samba star's penchant for dancing at Parisian night spots as much as waltzing past opponents. But Barcelona were confirmed admirers and a year later his club career - which had been somewhat grounded - really took off after a move to Spain. Sir Alex Ferguson had been confident of tempting him to Manchester United, but the lure of the Nou Camp was too strong. Things did not go that well at the start of his life in Spain, but following the winter break, Ronaldinho and Barcelona hit top gear, finishing the campaign strongly and earning a Champions League place. Transfer speculation has followed him throughout his young career and almost inevitably he was linked with Chelsea this summer. But even the Blues' billionaire owner Roman Abramovich could not prise him away from Barca, who rewarded him with an improved contract with a buy-out clause of Â£100m.

Tough rules for ringtone sellers Tough rules for ringtone sellers Firms that flout rules on how ringtones and other mobile extras are sold could be cut off from all UK phone networks. The rules allow offenders to be cut off if they do not let consumers know exactly what they get for their money and how to turn off the services. The first month under the new rules has seen at least ten firms suspended while they clean up the way they work. The rules have been brought in to ensure that the problems plaguing net users do not spread to mobile phones. In the last couple of years ringtones, wallpapers, screensavers and lots of other extras for phones have become hugely popular. But fierce competition is making it difficult for firms to get their wares in front of consumers, said Jeremy Flynn, head of third party services at Vodafone. "If you are not on the operator's portal you are going to have quite heavy marketing costs because it's a problem of how people discover your services," he said. To combat this many ringtone and other mobile content sellers started using a new tactic to squeeze more cash out of customers. This tactic involved signing people up for a subscription to give them, for instance, several ringtones per week or month instead of the single track they thought they were getting. Mr Flynn said that the move to using subscriptions happened over the space of a few weeks at the end of 2004. Websites such as grumbletext.co.uk started getting reports from customers who were racking up large bills for phone content they did not know they had signed up for. "What made us uncomfortable was that these services were not being marketed transparently," said Mr Flynn. "People did not know they were being offered a subscription service." "We saw potential for substantial consumer harm here," he added. The swift adoption of subscription services led to the creation of a new code of conduct for firms that want to sell content for mobile phones. The drafting of the new rules was led by the Mobile Entertainment Forum and the UK's phone firms. "Everyone is required to conform to this code of conduct," said Andrew Bud, regulatory head of the MEF and executive chairman of messaging firm MBlox. "It's all about transparency," he said. "Consumers have to be told what they have got themselves into and how to get out of it." "The consumer has a right to be protected," he said. Christian Harris, partnership manager of mobile content firm Zed, said the new system was essential if consumers were to trust companies that sell ringtones and other downloads. "The groundrules must be applied across the whole industry and if that's done effectively we will see the cowboys driven out," he said. The new rules came in to force on 15 January and the first month under the new regime has seen many firms cautioned for not honouring them. Some have been told to revamp websites so customers know what they get for their money and what they are signing up for, said Mr Flynn. Also, said Mr Flynn, Vodafone has briefly cut off between eight and ten content sellers flouting the rules. "We have quite draconian contracts with firms," he said. "We do not have to say why. We can just cut them off." Under the rules consumers must be able to switch off the services by using a universal "stop" command sent via text message. He said the system had been designed to limit how much a consumer will pay if they inadvertently signed up for a service. "The mobile is so personal that people really resent the abuse of what is effectively part of their personality," said Mr Flynn. Comments are closed for this article.

Van Nistelrooy hungry for return Van Nistelrooy hungry for return Manchester United striker Ruud van Nistelrooy said he was "hungry to play" as he returned to training on Tuesday. The Dutch striker, 28, is closing in on a comeback after nearly three months out with an Achilles injury. "I can't wait to get back training and meet up with my team-mates again," he told the Daily Mirror newspaper. "I'm ahead of schedule and I've made good progress with my physio in Holland. I have been away from United for a long time, but I'm fit again." United boss Sir Alex Ferguson hinted at a return for Van Nistelrooy in the FA Cup fifth round tie at Everton on Saturday. He said: "There is a chance he could be involved at Everton but we'll just have to see how he comes through training." United did not lose any of the 14 games in which Van Nistelrooy was involved before his injury - although their form has remained good since he was sidelined. Their 2-0 derby win at Manchester City on Sunday made it 13 wins in 15 league games. However, Van Nistelrooy is still the club's top scorer this season with 12 goals, despite being out since the 3-0 win against West Brom on 27 November. United have also been hit by injuries to both Alan Smith and Louis Saha during Van Nistelrooy's absence, meaning Wayne Rooney has sometimes had to play in a lone role up front. The teenager has responded with six goals in nine games, including the first goal against City on Sunday.
Wenger refuses to give up title Wenger refuses to give up title Arsene Wenger refused to concede the title, despite Arsenal falling seven points behind Chelsea after their 1-1 draw with Manchester City at Highbury. He said: "We have to believe we can come back and give everything in every game. For us to give up and say Chelsea have won it would be criminal. "I am very concerned because we have never been so far behind and Chelsea do not look like dropping seven points. "But we will still give our best until the end of the season." Wenger blamed his side's mounting injury list, with Sol Campbell and Dennis Bergkamp among those unavailable, for the failure to beat City. "We were too inexperienced," he added. "That doesn't take anything away from the qualities of the team who played well when they settled. "We over played a little in our half in the first half and got caught. "But the mental qualities in the second half were outstanding. We had chance after chance and I feel sorry for the team, we should have got three points." The Gunners took to the field with youngsters Justin Hoyte, Philippe Senderos and Robin van Persie standing in for first-team regulars. But Wenger reiterated his intention to stay out of the transfer market and maintained his team will continue to push Chelsea all the way at the top of the table. "We will fight for our championship," he added. "Sometimes you have a draw like that. Do you want me to say it's over? I won't say that. All we can do is try to win our games and we won't give up." Arsenal found support in their attempts to overhaul the seven-point gap to Chelsea from City boss Kevin Keegan. "I still think Arsenal will be the champions, even though it doesn't look that way at the moment," he said. "Six or seven points is not enough when you've got quality sides around you and Arsenal could go on a run of 30 or 40 games again - they're an amazing side." Comments are closed for this article.
Whatever way you look at it, Ireland is not a tax haven Whatever way you look at it, Ireland is not a tax haven Even the head of the OECD agrees that Irelandâs tax code adheres to international standards Jose Angel Gurria, secretary general of the OECD, came out this week and emphatically said Ireland was not a tax haven. Getty Feargal O'Rourke And so it begins again. An information request from the EU to three countries seeking further details about their tax systems â which is a regular feature of EU interaction with member states â triggers a slew of stories and commentary about âtax dealsâ, âtax havensâ and a broad denigration of the Irish tax system. Frankly, itâs sloppy, misleading and downright incorrect. Letâs nail the tax haven argument. Ãngel GurrÃ­a, head of the OECD, came out this week and emphatically said Ireland was not a tax haven, quoting the key criteria the OECD applies to national tax systems. Thatâs not enough for some people, who might prefer their own definitions. âWhen I use a word, it means just what I choose it to mean,â as Humpty Dumpty might say. However, one objective measure might be the number of countries willing to do business with us by signing a bilateral double taxation agreement. How many does Ireland have as of today? No fewer than 69, including all the major trading partners. So none of these countries thinks weâre a tax haven. Maybe Ireland is a tax haven because it does âdealsâ around the rate of tax which companies pay. This is not true, as confirmed by everyone from the Taoiseach to Revenue and departmental officials. âDouble Irishâ Why do these stories persist? The answer lies with a combination of the now infamous âdouble Irishâ and lazy accounting. As it has done since the inception of the State , Ireland taxes companies that are resident (âmanaged and controlledâ) here on their worldwide profits. The concept of management and control denotes where the board of directors makes key decisions affecting the entityâs affairs. If a company isnât resident here, it is still taxed here on the activities that take place in Ireland or on its Irish income. A company that is incorporated in Ireland but has no Irish directors, no Irish presence, no Irish employees, no Irish activities, no Irish income, no Irish assets, in fact nothing to do with Ireland other than where it was âbornâ, has no liability to Irish tax under the law. So, when you read that company X has done âa dealâ to get, say, a â3 per centâ rate, someone is talking about Irish tax expressed as a percentage of Irish taxable profits plus the profits of a company that has nothing to do with Ireland or has no Irish activities. In other words, it is a meaningless number. Transfer pricing rules What can be said with absolute certainty is that every company within the charge to Irish tax pays tax at 12.5 per cent on their activities â that is a fact. In addition, since 2010 we also have OECD standard transfer pricing rules, which give Revenue the power to ensure that the profits reported by a company are commensurate with the risks, functions and activities of the Irish entity. There is no doubt that in the current global tax debate the concept of having an Irish incorporated entity, albeit one with no Irish connections, being outside the charge to Irish tax, looks incongruous. My belief is that, within two years, we will enter a phase-out stage of this concept. However, in the overall scheme of things, and having regard to US and OECD tax developments, Ireland will still be an extremely attractive location for FDI. What do I believe the EU will conclude from the information it has sought from Ireland? First and foremost, they will find that Ireland operates an open and transparent legislative-based tax system that does what it says on the tin. A company pays tax at 12.5 per cent on its income with no special deals on the rate. It will find that â as happens in many countries â companies look to Revenue for some certainty that the profits it will report are commensurate with, and appropriate to, the footprint of the company here. It will find a tax system operated to the highest standards. In short, I donât believe any investigation will follow this information-gathering exercise. But, in future, we need to be a lot less supine in our defence of the Irish tax system so that the next time the âtax havenâ story rears its head, weâre much quicker to shoot it down.

When a child develops a behavioural or developmental problem, speedy intervention is critical. The e... When a child develops a behavioural or developmental problem, speedy intervention is critical. The early years of a young personâs life provide a precious window of opportunity to help get to the root of speech and language difficulties, emotional issues or other disorders. Delays, on the other hand, cause irreversible damage that can last a life-time. It is deeply disturbing, then, to learn that thousands of children with developmental delays and behavioural issues are waiting more than a year to see specialists, according to figures compiled by the Health Service Executive . Almost 2,000 children who have problems with basic functions such as walking are waiting more than 52 weeks for help. More than 500 children face delays of more than a year to be seen for conditions such as autism. Hundreds of children are also waiting long periods of time to get assessed for mental health difficulties and other problems. The scale of these waiting lists is frightening. Delays in accessing basic assessments or support fly in the face of what every piece of research tells us: every day counts when it comes to maximising a childâs chance of overcoming obstacles in their development. Instead of providing speedy access to psychology, occupational therapy or appropriate education, we are putting barriers in the way. A ban on recruitment in the HSE and cost-cutting is heaping even more pressure on overstretched services. We should be protecting children from the worst effects of austerity. But, if anything, children and their families are being exposed to its full force during key developmental milestones in their lives. Legislation such as the Disability Act - which entitles children to have their needs assessed within six months - is being widely flouted. In addition to health and social supports, Budget spending cuts have hit young people disproportionately hard through reductions in child benefit and back-to-school allowances. The economic crisis may mean there is not enough money to go around. However, these cuts are a false economy. Our failure to invest enough to support children means many young peopleâs life prospects may be profoundly damaged. Instead of saving money, we are simply storing up social and economic problems for the years to come. Last year, we held a referendum to strengthen childrenâs rights. The Government said the wording would protect the best interests of children and ensure the voice of the child is heard. Next weekâs Budget provides a test for our political leaders to meet these solemn pledges. Every child should have a right to the kind of support which helps fulfil their potential, without delay. To date, however, it seems the message has fallen on deaf ears. Comments are closed for this article.
Zambia confident and cautious Zambia confident and cautious Zambia's technical director, Kalusha Bwalya is confident and cautious ahead of the Cosafa Cup final against Angola on Saturday in Lusaka. Bwalya said: "Nothing short of victory will do." However Bwalya warned his side not to be too complacent. "I don't want my team to be too comfortable or too sure of victory as it is going to be a difficult game. "For me the main aim of the game is to enjoy and to win." Zambia have shown their determination to win this final by recalling nine of their foreign-based players. However the 41 year-old Bwalya, who became the oldest player to appear in the competition when he played and scored against Mauritius, is uncertain whether he will take to the field or not. The Chipolopolo fans however are not being so cautious with a 'victory' concert already scheduled for after the match featuring some of the country's top musicians. Both sides are hoping to win the competition for a record third time, and so keep the trophy for good. The Chipolopolo won the first two editions of the regional tournament for Southern African nations in 1997 and 1998. They were prevented from a third straight win by Angola who knocked out the Zambians at the semi-final stage in 1999. That victory for Angola also marked a first defeat in 14 years for Zambia at Lusaka's Independence stadium, where Saturday's game is being played. Angola named just four overseas-based players in their preliminary squad. The Palancas Negras have been unable to secure the release of many of their Portugal-based players.
A decade of good website design A decade of good website design The web looks very different today than it did 10 years ago. Back in 1994, Yahoo had only just launched, most websites were text-based and Amazon, Google and eBay had yet to appear. But, says usability guru Dr Jakob Nielsen, some things have stayed constant in that decade, namely the principles of what makes a site easy to use. Dr Nielsen has looked back at a decade of work on usability and considered whether the 34 core guidelines drawn up back then are relevant to the web of today. "Roughly 80% of the things we found 10 years ago are still an issue today," he said. "Some have gone away because users have changed and 10% have changed because technology has changed." Some design crimes, such as splash screens that get between a user and the site they are trying to visit, and web designers indulging their artistic urges have almost disappeared, said Dr Nielsen. "But there's great stability on usability concerns," he told the Online News News website. Dr Nielsen said the basic principles of usability, centring around ease of use and clear thinking about a site's total design, were as important as ever. "It's necessary to be aware of these things as issues because they remain as such," he said. They are still important because the net has not changed as much as people thought it would. "A lot of people thought that design and usability was only a temporary problem because broadband was taking off," he said. "But there are a very small number of cases where usability issues go away because you have broadband." Dr Nielsen said the success of sites such as Google, Amazon, eBay and Yahoo showed that close attention to design and user needs was important. "Those four sites are extremely profitable and extremely successful," said Dr Nielsen, adding that they have largely defined commercial success on the net. "All are based on user empowerment and make it easy for people to do things on the internet," he said. "They are making simple but powerful tools available to the user. "None of them have a fancy or glamorous look," he added, declaring himself surprised that these sites have not been more widely copied. In the future, Dr Nielsen believes that search engines will play an even bigger part in helping people get to grips with the huge amount of information online. "They are becoming like the operating system to the internet," he said. But, he said, the fact that they are useful now does not meant that they could not do better. Currently, he said, search sites did not do a very good job of describing the information that they return in response to queries. Often people had to look at a website just to judge whether it was useful or not. Tools that watch the behaviour of people on websites to see what they actually find useful could also help refine results. Research by Dr Nielsen shows that people are getting more sophisticated in their use of search engines. The latest statistics on how many words people use on search engines shows that, on average, they use 2.2 terms. In 1994 only 1.3 words were used. "I think it's amazing that we have seen a doubling in a 10-year period of those search terms," said Dr Nielsen.

American treasury has stated its borrowing authority will be exhausted by October 17th American treasury has stated its borrowing authority will be exhausted by October 17th The US Capitol dome is seen from the House side on Capitol Hill in Washington after the US Government shut down yesterday. Photograph: Online News. Nothing stuns an audience like a cliffhanger ending, but suspense is the last thing investors and the US treasury want from Washington . Yesterdayâs market reaction to news the US government would start to shut down numerous agencies after Congress failed to reach an agreement over the budget was, to say the least, relaxed. The dollar fell to near seven-month lows, rallying later. Gold led a slide in metals. But US stocks rose. One reason may be the Federal Reserve is now seen as less likely to âtaperâ its emergency asset-buying. Another is the markets are less worried about a probably short-lived government shutdown than they are about a bigger issue. Namely, will Congress raise Americaâs $16.7 trillion debt ceiling before the treasury is pushed into a corner and, possibly, delays making an interest payment on $12 trillion of outstanding government bonds â technically defaulting? Delayed payment For investors, bankers and rating agencies, the idea of the US delaying an interest payment is unthinkable. Indeed, given the acrimony in Washington, the bearish scenario is a replay of the events of August 2011, but with a far worse outcome. In the summer of 2011, the S&P 500 dropped nearly 20 per cent when an 11th-hour deal to raise the debt ceiling was followed by Standard & Poorâs stripping the US of its triple-A rating. The next two weeks will be crucial. âThis is a low probability event, but thereâs always a chance of a very dangerous mistake,â says Ira Jersey , director of US interest rate strategy at Credit Suisse . He expects the treasury to run out of cash on or about October 24th. As it stands, the treasury has stated that its borrowing authority will be exhausted by October 17th, leaving it with about $30 billion to pay its bills.â Comments are closed for this article.
Analysis: Remuneration in some hospitals no longer reflects scale of operations Analysis: Remuneration in some hospitals no longer reflects scale of operations Internal files state that three senior managers at St Vincentâs University Hospital were in receipt of additional remuneration from private sources. The HSE-funded salary for the chief executive of St Vincentâs is â¬145,959. Photograph: Dave Meehan Senior managers in State-funded voluntary hospitals and health agencies â officially known as section 38 organisations â are public servants. However, for years the full remuneration package of senior executives in these bodies remained a closely guarded secret in many cases. But over recent months a flood of detail has been emerging. The picture reveals a complex pattern of pay rates which evolved over years and which do not necessarily reflect the size and scale of the organisations today. In several instances, the rates paid differ from the official pay scales published by the Department of Health , with some organisations providing senior staff with non-sanctioned benefits such as private health insurance cover, motor and travel allowances, and payments for serving on boards or as a company secretary. Several agencies said they had received verbal approval from the department over the years for these payments. However there is no documentary evidence in official files. The Online News reported last September that a Health Service Executive internal audit investigation had found that funding to pay for these additional top-up benefits was being drawn from both State money and from externally provided resources. Allowances Auditors found at least 36 types of allowance and benefit including health insurance, extra duties and on-call payments were being made by voluntary hospitals and agencies to managers from HSE funds at a cost of â¬3.224 million. In some cases, State funding was used to make contributions â ranging from 6 to 46 per cent of salary â into private pension schemes. Auditors found 13 organisations were paying additional remuneration and benefits (including top-up salary and allowances ) to 34 managers from private sources. In one case the audit found privately generated funds were being used to pay for a non-pensionable annual allowance for an executive in respect of performance in a public hospital. Virtually at the same time as The Online News published the internal audit finding, the department issued a new policy circular aimed at clamping down on such top-up benefits. It said salary scales had to be adhered to strictly and that non-exchequer funding could not be used to supplement approved levels of remuneration. However, it did allow agencies to make a case to retain non-standard allowances for five years. While the audit gave details of the type of allowances and top-up payments and the locations where they were provided, it did not set out the actual levels of remuneration for individual managers. However, internal department files show the actual level of remuneration, including basic HSE-funded salary and any top-up allowances or payments applying to hundreds of management posts, across the various section 38 organisations. It is likely the rates set out in the file do not take account of pay cuts under the Haddington Road agreement. The file gives details of the â¬30,000 allowance paid to the chief executive of Crumlin hospital from income generated by shops on the campus. The department files also state three senior managers at St Vincentâs University Hospital were in receipt of additional remuneration from private sources. The HSE-funded salary for the chief executive of St Vincentâs is â¬145,959. A spokesman said: âAt St Vincentâs Healthcare Group, compensation for the additional work carried out for the group over and above public- sector obligations is paid from revenues from St Vincentâs Private Hospital . The compensation does not involve any public funds or any funds from the foundation or other donated funds.â
Apple laptop is 'greatest gadget' Apple laptop is 'greatest gadget' The Apple Powerbook 100 has been chosen as the greatest gadget of all time, by US magazine Mobile PC. The 1991 laptop was chosen because it was one of the first "lightweight" portable computers and helped define the layout of all future notebook PCs. The magazine has compiled an all-time top 100 list of gadgets, which includes the Sony Walkman at number three and the 1956 Zenith remote control at two. Gadgets needed moving parts and/or electronics to warrant inclusion. The magazine staff compiled the list and specified that gadgets also needed to be a "self-contained apparatus that can be used on its own, not a subset of another device". "In general we included only items that were potentially mobile," said the magazine. "In the end, we tried to get to the heart of what really makes a gadget a gadget," it concluded. The oldest "gadget" in the top 100 is the abacus, which the magazine dates at 190 A.D., and put in 60th place. Other pre-electronic gadgets in the top 100 include the sextant from 1731 (59th position), the marine chronometer from 1761 (42nd position) and the Kodak Brownie camera from 1900 (28th position). The Tivo personal video recorder is the newest device to make the top 10, which also includes the first flash mp3 player (Diamond Multimedia), as well as the first "successful" digital camera (Casio QV-10) and mobile phone (Motorola Startac). The most popular gadget of the moment, the Apple iPod, is at number 12 in the list while the first Sony transistor radio is at number 13. Sony's third entry in the top 20 is the CDP-101 CD player from 1983. "Who can forget the crystalline, hiss-free blast of Madonna's Like A Virgin emanating from their first CD player?" asked the magazine. Karl Elsener's knife, the Swiss Army Knife from 1891, is at number 20 in the list. Gadgets which could be said to feature surprisingly low down in the list include the original telephone (23rd), the Nintendo GameBoy (25th), and the Pulsar quartz digital watch (36th). The list also contains plenty of oddities: the Pez sweet dispenser (98th), 1990s toy Tamagotchi (86th) and the bizarre Ronco inside the shell egg scrambler (84th). Almost everyone has a mobile phone, how many people own a Powerbook? or an iPod? The findings of this magazine are not very convincing. What about the magnetic compass? We still use it 1,000 years after it was invented. I am amazed by the obsession with individual gadgets rather than genre. For example the Sony walkman was the first truly portable way of listening to your own music on the move whereas Minidisc, Flash MP3, portable CD players etc. are really just improvements in technology. My favourite 'true' gadgets are probably my portable MiniDisc player and the little battery powered whizzy thing I use to froth up my coffee! Calm down it's only in their opinion, and any list that includes the Taser in the top 100 gadgets has to be suspect.... Swiss army knife and no question about it. How many of the other items are still relatively unchanged from the original idea and still as useful/popular? You don't need a laptop or even a pocket calculator to work that one out! This list merely illustrates interesting cultural divides between the American authors and the overwhelmingly British responses. Brits see no further than mobile phones and the over thirties Sinclair; whilst the Americans focus on Apple, TV remotes and TiVO (which probably is rather obscure in Europe). What about the Soda Stream. This gadget changed my pre-teen life. Lap tops may enable you to "think different, but you cant use them to "get busy with the fizzy" How about Astro Wars, one of the pioneers for computer games, i remember spending many an hour playing this and it still works today! However tried it the other day and it was rubbish, still a great gadget of its time. Why worry about mobile phones. Soon they will be subsumed into the PDA's / laptops etc. What about the Marine Chronometer? Completely revolutionised navigation for boats and was in use for centuries. For it's time, a technological marvel! Sony Net Minidisc! It paved the way for more mp3 player to explode onto the market. I always used my NetMD, and could not go anywhere without it. A laptop computer is not a gadget! It's a working tool! The Sinclair Executive was the world's first pocket calculator. I think this should be there as well. How about the clockwork radio? Or GPS? Or a pocket calculator? All these things are useful to real people, not just PC magazine editors. Are the people who created this list insane ? Surely the most important gadget of the modern age is the mobile phone? It has revolutionised communication, which is more than can be said for a niche market laptop. From outside the modern age, the marine chronometer is the single most important gadget, without which modern transportation systems would not have evolved so quickly. Has everyone forgot about the Breville pie maker?? An interesting list. Of the electronic gadgets, thousands of journalists in the early 1980s blessed the original noteboook pc - the Tandy 100. The size of A4 paper and light, three weeks on a set of batteries, an excellent keyboard, a modem. A pity Tandy did not make it DOS compatible. What's an Apple Powerbook 100 ? It's out of date - not much of a "gadget". Surely it has to be something simple / timeless - the tin opener, Swiss Army Knife, safety razor blade, wristwatch or the thing for taking stones out of horses hooves ? It has to be the mobile phone. No other single device has had such an effect on our way of living in such a short space of time. The ball point pen has got to be one of the most used and common gadgets ever. Also many might be grateful for the pocket calculator which was a great improvement over the slide rule. The Casio pocket calculator that played a simple game and made tinny noises was also a hot gadget in 1980. A true gadget, it could be carried around and shown off. All top 10 are electronic toys, so the list is probably a better reflection of the current high-tech obsession than anything else. I say this as the Swiss Army Knife only made No 20. Sinclair QL a machine far ahead of its time. The first home machine with a true multi-takings OS. Shame the marketing was so bad!!! Apple.. a triumph of fashion over... well everything else. Utter rubbish. Yes, the Apple laptop and Sony Walkman are classic gadgets. But to call the sextant and the marine chronometer 'gadgets' and rank them as less important than a TV remote control reveals a quite shocking lack of historical perspective. The former literally helped change the world by vastly improving navigation at see. The latter is the seed around which the couch potato culture has developed. No competition. I'd also put Apple's Newton and the first Palm Pilot there as the front runners for portable computing, and possibly the Toshiba Libretto for the same reason. I only wish that Vulcan Inc's Flipstart wasn't just vapourware otherwise it would be at the top. How did a laptop ever manage to beat off the challenge of the wristwatch or the telephone (mobile or otherwise)? What about radios and TVs? The swiss army knife. By far the most useful gadget. I got mine 12 years ago. Still wearing and using it a lot! It stood the test of time. Psion Organiser series 3, should be up there. Had a usable qwerty keyboard, removable storage, good set of apps and programmable. Case design was good (batteries in the hinge - a first, I think). Great product innovation. The first mobile PC was voted best gadget by readers of...err... mobile PC?! Why do you keep putting these obviously biased lists on your site? It's obviously the mobile phone or remote control, and readers of a less partisan publication would tell you that. The Motorola Startac should be Number One. Why? There will be mobile phones long after notebook computers and other gadgets are either gone or integrated in communications devices. The Psion series 3c! The first most practical way to carry all your info around... I too would back the Sinclair Spectrum - without this little beauty I would never have moved into the world of IT and earn the living that I do now. I'd have put the mobile phone high up the list. Probably a Nokia model. Sinclair Spectrum - 16k. It plugged into the tv. Games were rubbish but it gave me a taste for programming and that's what I do for a living now. I wish more modern notebooks -- even Apple's newest offerings -- were more like the PB100. Particularly disheartening is the demise of the trackball, which has given way to the largely useless "trackpad" which every notebook on the market today uses. They're invariably inaccurate, uncomfortable, and cumbersome to use. Congratulations to Apple, a deserved win! Return to results
Barwick installed as new FA boss Barwick installed as new FA boss New Football Association chief executive Brian Barwick has been handed the task of restoring the organisation's credibility. The FA has suffered with financial problems and the Faria Alam scandal. Sports minister Richard Caborn said: "Brian's main task will be to restore the respect and authority. "The FA has taken some knocks and it will be up to him to pick the organisation up again so it is respected by all parts of the game." One of Barwick's first jobs could be to try to get to the bottom of a claim that Chelsea held an illegal meeting with Arsenal's England defender Ashley Cole on 27 January. However, it could be that the FA decide to leave that matter to the Premier League, in which case Barwick would certainly have enough to get to grips with. Former chief executive Mark Palios and his communications director Colin Gibson left the FA in August 2004 after revelations both Palios and England coach Sven-Goran Eriksson had affairs with secretary Alam. Even the announcement of Barwick's appointment in November was not straightforward, with a vocal minority of the FA board left furious that the position was not left empty until an independent review had been completed. Caborn added: "The most important issue coming up is the independent review by Lord Burns, and Brian will need to act on the recommendations to ensure that a good system of governance is brought into the FA. "We have 40,000 football clubs in this country, it is our national game, and it is important that the FA has the authority and leadership to deal with the game from the England team at the very top right down to the grass-roots." Gordon Taylor, chief executive of the Professional Footballers' Association, called for Barwick to include all levels of the game more in the running of the FA. He said: "It is important that the FA should be a lot more inclusive in their policy-making process. "The executive board is made up of the Premier League, Football League and grass-roots game but there is no structure that gives proper places for supporters, players, managers or referees' representatives. "In the past promises have been made by various to include all parts of the game but that wasn't the case and things blew up in their faces." Return to results
Beckham's chat reigns in Spain Beckham's chat reigns in Spain England captain David Beckham won a spontaneous round of applause from journalists as he made his first real attempt at speaking Spanish in public. The Real Madrid midfielder tried a curious mix of Spanish and English at a news conference. "El partido con Atletico was mucho mejor para todos," he declared. And yes, that was 'was'. Of course, in English it all translates as "The game against Atletico was much better for all of us." A smiling Beckham, wearing a large white woolly hat, was talking about his side's recent victory over their fierce city rivals. The 29-year-old blushed as he fielded questions in stilted Spanish but will have won over many people as he provided the first evidence he was beginning to use the language. However, quite how Beckham's Spanish lessons are going remains to be seen - dare we say he might have been rehearsing for this moment? Beckham said Wanderley Luxemburgo's appointment as coach had helped Real recover their confidence. And the Brazilian's arrival, he added, was one of the reasons Real had narrowed Barcelona's lead at the top of the table to seven points. The former Manchester United player went on to address questions about his poor run of form in 2004, when allegations about his private life also surfaced. "The criticism will always be there," he said. "If you have a bad game your career is finished, or you are too old even though you're only 29. "I'm enjoying my football and I've still got five or six years left. Maybe it's not the best I have played but I suppose the European Championship didn't help with missing a couple of penalties. "People said the reason I didn't play (well) was because of personal things in my life but I have just got to keep working hard." Beckham insisted he had no intention of returning to England in the immediate future and that he would be happy to extend his contract, which runs until 2007. WHAT BECKHAM SAID (A rough translation - minus various ummms and aahs from the England skipper. Fancy learning some more? Try Spanish Steps - for a few language pointers.) How do (the players) feel after cutting Barcelona's lead to seven points by beating Real Sociedad and Atletico? El partido con Atletico was mucho mejor para todos. Siete puntos es mucho mejor para los jugadores. Es dificil pero estamos mejorando. Tenemos que trabajar mucho. The game against Atletico was much better for all of us. Seven points are much better for the players. It's difficult, but we are improving. We need to work hard. Can Madrid really win the league? Es posible. Podemos ganar la liga, pero es muy dificil. Juntos podemos ganar titulos. It's possible. We can win the league but it is very difficult. Together, we can win titles. How do you feel about the appointment of Arrigo Sacchi as director of football? Sacchi...la estabilidad es muy importante. Sacchi...Stability is very important. Where do you prefer to play? Para mi, no es importante mi posici&#243;n. For me, my position isn't important. Comments are closed for this article.

The ties will be played on the weekend of 12-13 March. was delighted to be paired with United, although he admitted they still have plenty of work to do to set up a dream tie. "We've got our work cut out next Tuesday but you can't deny it's exciting," he said. "It would be a sell-out. It will probably be on television. We have financial problems and the revenue it could bring in would certainly help our situation. "We're happy to be in the draw but we've still got to beat a Premiership team. "We've got to beat Southampton first and that's going to be a hard game but if we do there will be some celebration." welcomed the opportunity to face United. "We're not counting on anything yet," he said. "It is obviously going to be a difficult replay judging by the way Brentford came back at us on Saturday and the fact that United have come out of the hat will give them even more incentive. "But I've been drawn against United so many times in cups and beaten them at both Bournemouth and West Ham. "There are no easy ties in the FA Cup and I'm sure nobody is counting on one."

Benitez joy as Reds take control Benitez joy as Reds take control Liverpool boss Rafael Benitez was satisfied after his team's 3-1 win over Bayer Leverkusen despite conceding a goal in the last minute. "Before the game if you had said the score will be 3-1 I would have happily accepted that," said Benitez. "But you must realise that you have to concentrate right to the very last seconds of a game at this level. "I have confidence that we can complete the task in Germany. I am always confident and we must be positive." Benitez defended goalkeeper Jerzy Dudek, whose failure to hold on to Dimitar Berbatov's weak drive allowed Franca to score with the last kick of the game - and give the German team a lifeline for the second leg. "For me it was not Jerzy Dudek's fault," added Benitez. "He had played a very good game - and had we scored our other chances, nobody would be talking about about their goal. It would not have mattered. "If we had scored our other chances it would not have been worth remembering that last goal. "In my opinion Jerzy played well, made two very fine saves - and I am happy with him. "If we lose 2-0 we are out but I think we can score in Germany - certainly one, and that will make all the difference." And the Liverpool boss is looking forward to having skipper Steven Gerrard, who was suspended for the Anfield leg, back for the return in Germany. "Steven Gerrard is a key player for us," said Benitez. "When he is on the pitch he makes everyone else play better - and the opposition pay special attention to him - which gives space for others. "Steven is one of the best players in the world, but I need a team that is not about just one player. There must be 11 players on the pitch all doing well." Return to results
Biggest monthly fall in unemployment in 16 years to 2.5 million Biggest monthly fall in unemployment in 16 years to 2.5 million Just under 2.5 million people were out of work in the UK in the three months to August, down by 18,000 on the previous three months. Photograph: Rui Vieira/PA Wire The number of people in work in the UK has reached a record high of almost 30 million after a new fall in unemployment. Just under 2.5 million people were out of work in the three months to August, down by 18,000 on the previous three months, while figures showed the biggest monthly fall in jobseekerâs allowance claimants for 16 years. The so-called claimant count has now been cut for 11 consecutive months after Septemberâs fall of 41,700 to 1.35 million. Employment rose by 155,000 to 29.87 million, the biggest total ever recorded, giving a rate of 71.7 per cent. People classed as economically inactive also fell, by 83,000 to 8.95 million, while job vacancies rose by 6,000 over the latest quarter to 541,000, the highest for five years. But todayâs data from the Office for National Statistics also showed that 1.45 million people were working part-time because they could not find full-time jobs, the highest figure since records began in 1992. Average earnings growth fell back from 1.2 per cent to 0.7 per cent for the year to August compared to the previous month. Average weekly earnings in private firms increased by 1.1 per cent but the annual growth rate in the public sector slumped to minus 0.5 per cent, the lowest since 2001. Fewer people on high pay and more workers on lower pay in the public sector could be behind the figure. The latest figures showed a 69,000 increase in male full-time employment and 21,000 increase in part-time employment, while the number of women in part-time jobs fell by 13,000 compared with a 79,000 rise in full-time female employment. There were 958,000 unemployed 16 to 24-year-olds in the latest three months, down by 1,000 over the quarter. More than 1.1 million people have been unemployed for up to six months, down 32,000, but those out of work for between six months and a year rose by 29,000 to 446,000. The number of people out of work for over a year fell by 15,000 to 900,000. PA .

Bomb threat at Bernabeu stadium Bomb threat at Bernabeu stadium Spectators were evacuated from Real Madrid's Bernabeu stadium on Sunday following a bomb scare during the game between the hosts and Real Sociedad. More than 70,000 people abandoned the ground with the score at 1-1 and only three minutes left to play. The Basque newspaper Gara apparently received a telephone call saying a bomb was due to explode at 2100 local time. But after searching the stadium with sniffer dogs, the police said that no explosive device had been found. "The police have said they have completed their search and have not found anything," said Real Madrid president Florentino Perez. "The best thing we can all do now is to put this nightmare behind us." Madrid midfielder Guti told private Spanish radio station Cadena Ser: "I have never seen this before and sport should be above it all." Real took the lead just before the break when Brazilian striker Ronaldo cracked home with his left foot. Sociedad levelled the match midway through the second half when Turkish striker Nihat Kahveci smashed home with an acrobatic finish. It is not yet clear if the remaining three minutes of the game will be played at a later date or if the result will be allowed to stand. If the result remains at 1-1, Real will drop to third place in the standings, 11 points behind leaders Barcelona, who snatched a late 2-1 win at Albacete on Saturday. Initial reports suggested the Basque separatist group ETA may be responsible for the bomb threat after issuing similar warnings before a series of small explosions in recent days. The Bernabeu was targeted by ETA on 1 May, 2002, when Madrid were about to play FC Barcelona in a Champions League semi-final. A car bomb exploded in a street outside the stadium and 17 people were slightly injured. Return to results
Casual gaming to 'take off' Casual gaming to 'take off' Games aimed at "casual players" are set to be even bigger in 2005, according to industry experts. Easy-to-play titles that do not require too much time and that are playable online or downloadable to mobile devices will see real growth in the coming year. The trend shows that gaming is not just about big-hitting, games console titles, which appeal more to "hardcore" gamers, said a panel of experts. They were speaking before the annual Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas which showcases the latest trends in gadgets and technologies for 2005. The panel also insisted that casual gamers were not just women, a common misconception which pervades current thinking about gamer demographics. Casual games like poker, pool, bridge, bingo and puzzle-based titles, which can be played online or downloaded onto mobile devices, were "gender neutral" and different genres attracted different players. Greg Mills, program director at AOL, said its figures suggested that sports-based games attracted 90% of 18 to 24-year-old males, while puzzle games were played by 80% of females. Games like bridge tended to attract the over-50 demographic of gamers. But hardcore gamers who are more attracted to blockbuster gamers which usually require hi-spec PCs, like Half-Life 2, or Halo 2 on Xbox, also liked to have a different type of gaming experience. "When hardcore gamers are not playing Halo, they are playing poker and pool, based on our research," said Geoff Graber, director of Yahoo Games, which attracts about 12 million gamers a month. With the growth of powerful PC technology and ownership, broadband take-up, portable players and mobile devices, as well as interactive TV, casual gaming is shaping up to be big business in 2005, according to the panel. The focus for the coming year should be about attracting third-party developers into the field to offer more innovative and multiplayer titles, they agreed. "We are at a time where we are on the verge of something much bigger," said Mr Graber. "Casual games will get into their stride in 2005, will be really big in 2006 and will be about community." With more people finding more to do with their gadgets and high-speed connections, casual games would start to open up the world of gaming as a form of mass-market entertainment to more people. Key to these types of titles is the chance they give people who may not see themselves as gamers to dip in and out of games when they liked. Portal sites which offer casual games, like AOL, Yahoo, and RealArcade, as well as other games-on-demand services, allow people to build up buddy lists so they can return and play against the same people. This aspect of "community" is crucial for gamers who just want to have quick access to free or cheap games without committing long periods of time immersed in Â£30 to Â£40 console or PC titles, said the panel. About 120,000 people are expected to attend the CES trade show which stretches over more than 1.5 million square feet and which officially runs from 6 to 9 January. The main theme is how new devices are getting better at talking to each other, allowing people to enjoy digital content, like audio, video and images, when they want, and where they want.

Central Bank paper shows how mortgage lending fuelled boom Central Bank paper shows how mortgage lending fuelled boom 40% of mortgages were issued between 2004 and 2007, when prices were at peak Between 1997 and 2007, real Irish house prices increased by an average of 9 per cent per annum, the highest rate for the OECD. Photograph: Alan Betson/The Online News The banks pumped more money into the Irish mortgage market during the boom by increasing the âincome fractionâ that dictated the amount that could be loaned out to would-be borrowers, according to a new paper published today by the Central Bank . The analysis shows that where Irish banks were issuing mortgages in 2000 that would cost slightly more than 16 per cent of a borrowerâs gross income to service, this rose rapidly during the boom, to higher than 25 per cent by 2007. Since the property market crashed, the income fraction has dropped again and is back near the 16 per cent level. The paper says that at around 2000 the Irish banks â AIB , Bank of Ireland , the EBS and IL&P, who together accounted for approximately 70 per cent of the Irish mortgage market â were keen to increase the level of credit available to the residential property market and focused on using the âincome fraction channelâ to achieve this. At the same time the Irish credit institutions found that they could source an increased amount of funding in the international wholesale markets due to a number of international factors, and the already thriving residential and commercial property markets in Ireland provided considerable demand for this increased funding. âOne of the most significant developments in international banking finance over the past fifteen years has been the extent to which financial institutions have been able to fund credit provision outside their deposit base,â according to the paper. During a period when increasing property values were an international phenomenon, the Irish case stands out, the paper says. Between 1997 and 2007, real Irish house prices increased by an average of 9 per cent per annum, the highest rate for the OECD. During the same period the Irish credit market experienced a considerable degree of financial liberalisation. âSince 2007, Irish house price declines have been the most severe across the OECD. Given that nearly 40 per cent of the total stock of Irish mortgages was issued between 2004 and 2007, when prices were at their highest, the sharp subsequent decline has given rise to a significant degree of negative equity being experienced by Irish households.â Credit conditions in a boom and bust property market was written by Yvonne McCarthy and Kieran McQuinn. .

Central Bank study calls for more diversified mix of funding options Central Bank study calls for more diversified mix of funding options The Central Bank study says SMEs have been âdisproportionately exposedâ to weaknesses in the banking sector. Photograph: David Sleator Irish small and medium businesses rely more on bank support than most of their peers across Europe and, as a result have been âdisproportionately exposedâ to weaknesses in the sector, a study from the Central Bank has found. However, both demand for and supply of bank borrowing has fallen significantly since 2005 â with the figure halving by 2012. âA more diversified mix of funding options than those currently available would represent a more sustainable long-run Irish SME financing environment,â the authors of the study argue. âPolicy must aim to stimulate the flow of credit and to create well-developed markets for a range of alternative financing sources to complement the role of banks in financing SMEs in Irelandâ. Sources of funding The study examined sources of funding for smaller and medium-sized businesses both pre- and post-crisis, and found that, over both periods, Irish SMEs are either the most, or second most, reliant on bank borrowing, across 13 European countries. In 2005, before the crisis erupted, the proportion of Irish SMEs that used bank borrowing to finance investment or working capital was the second highest across Europe, behind Germany, the figures show. Seven years later, in 2012, despite the squeeze on liquidity, Ireland remained among those countries with the highest usage of banks for SME funding â with the highest proportion of firms reporting that they used bank overdrafts. Tightened credit Given the tightening up of credit, and the focus by SMEs on meeting everyday financing needs, rather than seeking out funding for growth, Irish SMEs are now beginning to use other sources of finance more than in the past. Internal funding (for investment), along with trade credit and equity (for both investment and working capital)are being used more intensively by Irish SMEs in 2012 than in 2005, the report says, suggesting that a substitution from bank to alternative financing has taken place.

Chelsea hold Arsenal Chelsea hold Arsenal A gripping game between Arsenal and Chelsea ended with the honours finishing even at Highbury. Thierry Henry produced a sublime strike to put Arsenal ahead but John Terry levelled with a powerful header. Henry's quickly-taken free-kick put Arsenal back in front but Eidur Gudjohnsen equalised with a header from William Gallas' knockback. Henry missed a golden chance when he blazed a shot high late on and Arsenal also had a penalty appeal rejected. Henry's opener had given Arsenal the perfect start and set up an enthralling affair. The French striker headed a long Cesc Faregas ball back to Jose Antonio Reyes from the edge of the Chelsea area and immediately saw it headed back into his path from the Spaniard. And, with his back to goal, Henry finished with aplomb when he took one touch, turned and struck an angled strike past the despairing dive of keeper Petr Cech. Henry epitomised a determination about the Arsenal side but Chelsea appeared unruffled and equalised after 16 minutes. Gunners keeper Manuel Almunia, who got the nod ahead of Jens Lehmann, did well to save a well-struck Frank Lampard shot. But he could not keep out Terry's powered header from the resultant corner as Arsenal's weakness at set-pieces was again exposed. Almost immediately, Henry went close and Chelsea gathered the loose ball before going straight up the other end where Gudjohnsen fluffed an effort. Gudjohnsen did not make the same error minutes later when he struck a sweet shot only for Almunia to be equal to the task and save. The homes side regained the lead in controversial fashion when Robert Pires won a dubious free-kick. And, given the option to take the 25-yard set-piece quickly, Henry curled in a shot with Cech still organising his wall. This time Arsenal did not allow Chelsea to level so soon as they went into the break ahead. Chelsea brought striker Didier Drogba on to partner Gudjohnsen up front after the interval and the move reaped immediate reward. Lampard swung in a cross which Gallas knocked back across goal and a deft header from Gudjohnsen levelled matters again. Chelsea's main threat was coming from crosses and Lampard missed a great opportunity as he headed wide when left unmarked at the far post. The second half failed to live up to the thrilling pace of the opening period but there were flashes of brilliance. One of them came from the enigmatic Robben when he jinked his way through two Arsenal defenders only to see his poked shot saved by Almunia. Arsenal ended the match the stronger and worked a excellent chance for Henry who put a left-foot shot high from eight yards. Subtitute Robin van Persie could also have nicked a win for the Highbury outfit but frustratingly sidefooted just wide. Matthieu Flamini had a late penal appeal waved away before the final whistle which maintained Chelsea five-point Premiership lead over Arsenal.

Cork University Hospital to look at locating helipad on a car park on the hospital campus Cork University Hospital to look at locating helipad on a car park on the hospital campus CUH has been without a helipad for 10 years despite being a level 1 trauma centre The HSE South has confirmed that a helipad could be located on the grounds of Cork University Hospital (CUH) using a site that has become available because a co-located private hospital on the CUH campus will not now be built. HSE South area manager for Cork Ger Reaney told a HSE South Regional Forum the decision not to proceed with the co-located hospital on the campus had freed up a potential site for a helipad on a staff car park. A helipad on this site would be served by a direct corridor link to the hospitalâs emergency department, said Mr Reaney , saying it was one of a number of helipad options to be examined. Among other options are locating a helipad on the roof of the new emergency department itself, as well as two longer-term options of locating it on rooftops of two buildings still awaiting completion or development. CUH had a helipad on the rooftop of its old emergency department but it was removed in 2003 when the new emergency department was built. Although the provision was made in the new building for a rooftop helipad, funds were never made available. The absence of a helipad at the hospital has meant helicopters carrying serious casualties have had to land at Cork Airport 8km away, with the casualty being transferred by ambulance with an average journey time of 10 minutes. The issue was raised at a recent meeting of the HSE South Regional Forum by Fianna FÃ¡il councillor Mary Shields , who said it was unacceptable that CUH was the only level 1 trauma centre in the State without helicopter landing facilities. Ms Shields said a more recent arrangement whereby helicopters carrying casualties landed at nearby Highfield Rugby Club was not acceptable, particularly given that CUHâs capacity is about to increase from 800 to 1,000 beds with the opening of a new cardiac unit.

Creator of first Apple Mac dies Creator of first Apple Mac dies Jef Raskin, head of the team behind the first Macintosh computer, has died. Mr Raskin was one of the first employees at Apple and made many of the design decisions that made the Mac so distinctive when it was first released. He led the team that decided to use a graphical interface and mouse that let people navigate around the computer by pointing and clicking. The 1984 release of the Mac reflected Mr Raskin's belief that good design should make computers easy to use. Mr Raskin joined Apple in 1978 as employee number 31, initially to lead the company's publications department. However, in 1979 he was put in charge of a small team to design a computer that lived up to his idea of a machine that was cheap, aimed at consumers rather than computer professionals and was very easy to use. The result was the 1984 Macintosh that did away with the then common text-based interface in favour of one based around graphics that resembled a virtual desktop and used folders and documents. Users navigated around the machine using a mouse and by pointing, clicking and dragging. Although now in common use in almost all computers, these methods were pioneering when first used in the Macintosh. The GUI was developed by Xerox PARC, and used in its Star machine. But the acceptance of the interface did not truly begin until the concept was developed for use by Apple in its pioneering Lisa computer. "His role on the Macintosh was the initiator of the project, so it wouldn't be here if it weren't for him," said Andy Hertzfeld, an early Macintosh team member. Although Mr Raskin drove the team that created the Macintosh he did not stay at Apple to see it released. In 1981 he was removed from the project following a dispute with Apple's mercurial boss Steve Jobs. In 1982, Mr Raskin left Apple entirely. The Macintosh was reputedly named after Mr Raskin's favourite apple, though the name was changed slightly following a trademark dispute with another company. After leaving Apple, Mr Raskin founded another company called Information Appliance and continued to work on better ways to interface with computers. He was also an accomplished musician, played three instruments and conducted San Francisco's Chamber Opera Society. Mr Raskin was diagnosed in December 2004 with pancreatic cancer and died on 26 February at his home in California. Comments are closed for this article.
Decision comes after institution agrees to implement abortion law Decision comes after institution agrees to implement abortion law File image from 2012 of Fr Kevin DoranPhotograph: Brenda Fitzsimons / THE IRISH TIMES Fr Kevin Doran has resigned from two boards of the Mater Hospital after the institution issued a statement saying it would comply with new abortion legislation. According to the Irish Catholic newspaper this morning, Fr Doran said he could not in conscience be a member of the Mater Hospital Board of Directors or Board of Governors. âI can confirm that I have resigned because I canât reconcile my own conscience personally with the statement, largely because I feel a Catholic hospital has to bear witnessâ¦ to Gospel values alongside providing excellent care,â Fr Doran told the paper. The hospital did not have a statement at the time of writing. In a brief statement last week the Mater said it would comply with the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act, which sets out the circumstances where a termination of pregnancy may be performed. The statement read: âThe Mater Hospital has carefully considered the Act. The Hospitalâs priority is to be at the frontier of compassion, concern and clinical care for all our patients. Having regard to that duty, the Hospital will comply with the law as provided for in the act.â Previously Fr Doran said the hospital could ânot complyâ with the legislation as it ran counter to its Catholic ethos. The Mater Misericordiae University Hospital is a Catholic voluntary hospital and was founded by the Sisters of Mercy in 1861. In its mission statement, the hospital says that by caring for the sick, âwe participate in the healing ministry of Jesus Christâ. The other members of the hospitalâs board of directors are: John Morgan, Sr Margherita Rock, Sr Eugene Nolan, Prof Conor OâKeane, Mary Day, Caroline Pigott, Dr Mary Carmel Burke, Martin Cowley, Don Mahony, Prof Brendan Kinsley, Thomas Lynch and Eddie Shaw.
Domain system scam fear Domain system scam fear A system to make it easier to create website addresses using alphabets like Cyrillic could open a back door for scammers, a trade body has warned. The Internationalised Domain Names system has been a work in progress for years and has recently been approved by the Internet Electronic Task Force. But the UK Internet Forum (UKIF) is concerned that the system will let scammers create fake sites more easily. The problem lies in the computer codes used to represent language. Registering names that look like that of legitimate companies but lead users to fake sites designed to steal passwords and credit card details could become a whole lot easier for determined scammers, says Stephen Dyer, director of UKIF. Domain names are the "real language" addresses of websites, rather than their internet protocol address, which is a series of numbers. They are used so people can more easily navigate the web. So-called ASCII codes are used to represent European languages but for other languages a hybrid of a system called Unicode is used. So, for example, website PayPal could now be coded using a mixture of the Latin alphabet and the Russian alphabet. The resulting domain as displayed to the users would look identical to the real site as a Russian 'a' look just like an English 'a'. But the computer code would be different, and the site it would lead users to could be a fake. This is more than just a theory. A fake Paypal.com has already been registered with net domain giant Verisign by someone who has followed the debate around the Internationalised Domain Name (IDN) system, said Mr Dyer. As the idea was to prove a point rather than be malicious the fake domain has now been handed back to Paypal but it sets a worrying precedent, Mr Dyer said. "Although the IDN problem is well known in technical circles, the commercial world is totally unaware how easily their websites can be faked," said Mr Dyer. "It is important to alert users that there is a new and invisible and almost undetectable way of diverting them to what looks like a perfectly genuine site," he added. There are solutions. For instance, browsers could spot domains that use mixed characters and display them in different colours as a warning to users. Mr Dyer acknowledged that it would be a huge undertaking to update all the world's browsers. Another solution, to introduce IDN-disabled browsers could be a case of "throwing out the baby with the bath water," he said. CENTR, the Council of European National Top Level Domain Registries, agrees. "A rush to introduce IDN-disabled browsers into the marketplace is an overly-zealous step that will harm public confidence in IDNs - a technology that is desperately needed in the non-English speaking world," the organisation said in a statement.

Draghi praises Ireland for crisis efforts Draghi praises Ireland for crisis efforts Improvements made âon all frontsâ with structural reforms and risk management, ECB president says European Central Bank president Mario Draghi: âStructural reforms have been undertaken and financial stability risks have consistently, continuously and significantly been reduced in Ireland.â Photograph: Andrew Harrer/Online News European Central Bank president Mario Draghi praised Irelandâs efforts to repair its public finances and banking sector saying that the country has improved âon all frontsâ since the financial crisis. Mr Draghi declined to comment on whether Ireland would require a precautionary credit line, similar to an overdraft facility, when it exits the EU-IMF bailout programme at the end of the year. âI donât want to comment on this specific issue because it is just being discussed by the relevant authorities,â he told reporters at the annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank in Washington. Ireland had done âreally well all throughout this dramatic periodâ, he said in response to a question from The Online News. âIt has improved on all fronts, all fronts, and it shows, it has shown in the higher rate of growth, higher than in most countries in the euro area last year,â he said at a press conference on Saturday. Right things âIt is now slowing down a little but thatâs, I think to me, the largest evidence that the right things have been done. Structural reforms have been undertaken and financial stability risks have consistently, continuously and significantly been reduced in Ireland.â Irelandâs borrowing costs have fallen steadily and the Irish banks have dramatically reduced their reliance on cheap ECB funding over the past two years suggesting that the Government can fund itself without resorting to continued emergency external loans at the end of the bailout programme. On Friday Europeâs Economic and Monetary Affairs Commissioner Olli Rehn said that it was âprematureâ to say whether Ireland would need a precautionary facility to exit the three-year programme. Draft budget Ahead of tomorrowâs budget, Mr Rehnâs spokesman told The Online News that the European Commissionâs preliminary view of a draft budget was that it provided âa sound basis for taking forward the necessary fiscal consolidation in Ireland and paving the way for a successful programme exitâ. The progress made during Irelandâs programme could be seen in Washington by the fact the country did not figure in open discussions at the IMF- World Bank annual meetings. While speakers accepted that the financial crisis had dissipated in Europe , warnings were made about the return to growth. Comments are closed for this article.
Dublin Simon chief says homelessness policy now âin the worst of timesâ Dublin Simon chief says homelessness policy now âin the worst of timesâ Number of rough-sleepers in Dublin up 88% compared with same period last year Sam McGuinness of Dublin Simon Community: âThe only break point is organisations like ourselves trying to get more housing capacity, but itâs only a pee-hole in the snow.â Photograph: Frank Miller / The Online News There is âcurrently no chanceâ the Governmentâs target of eliminating long-term homelessness by 2016 will be met, the chief executive of the Dublin Simon Community has said. Sam McGuinness, speaking at the publication of the charityâs annual review, said the homelessness and rough sleeping crises were âworse than everâ. Number of rough-sleepers in Dublin up 88 per cent . The homeless fella on the street canât afford private-rented accommodation. Rents are going up, rent allowance caps are coming down all the time, thereâs no extra accommodation being provided. Itâs a complete logjam. âThe only break point is organisations like ourselves trying to get more housing capacity, but itâs only a pee-hole in the snow. Think about it â there are 1,400 people currently in emergency accommodation and 50 per cent of them have been there three, four or five years. About 80 per cent of them are there are over a year. So I canât see them ending long-term homelessness by 2016. Last year the most they housed in Dublin from the homeless list was 900.â In February, Minister of State for Housing Jan OâSullivan published a homelessness policy statement committing the Government to ending long-term homelessness by 2016. It was welcomed by housing organisations as a credible target, though they warned resources would have to be targeted at the goal without delay. Homeless helpline Mr McGuinness said yesterday: âIn the second quarter of this year nearly 10,000 people called the homeless helpline. Over 5,000 people presented at the central placement unit. So we have a picture for the State that it has become significantly worse and itâs getting worse again. âI would love to hear from the Minister how sheâs going to get those numbers down. [Homeless] people have wounded lives. The longer you are on the street the less nourishment you get. There is no consistency in what you eat, what you drink. The sleep youâre getting is not great. When some behave badly itâs because of all those things.â The Dublin Simon Community conducts weekly âstreet countsâ of the number of people sleeping rough in the city centre between Jervis Street, Amiens Street and Harcourt Street. The count has found a 66 per cent increase in the first half of this year (January to June) compared to the same period in 2012. The increase for July to September this year was a âstaggeringâ 88 per cent compared with the same period last year, said Mr McGuinness. âThe September count, carried out on September 3rd, of 85 people sleeping in one night is very frightening and the highest since we started our regular count some years ago.â Profoundly damaging He said the long-term impact of rough sleeping on a person was profoundly damaging, mentally and physically. He said in the absence of energetic policy on housing provision by Government, Dublin Simon had moved into âhousing developmentâ. Yesterdayâs event was hosted in a newly-refurbished home in the Cabra area of Dublin, which would provide a permanent supported home to over 20 people. Comments are closed for this article.
Dublin hi-tech labs to shut down Dublin hi-tech labs to shut down Dublin's hi-tech research laboratory, Media Labs Europe, is to shut down. The research centre, which was started by the Irish government and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, was a hotbed for technology concepts. Since its opening in 2000, the centre has developed ideas, such as implants for teeth, and also aimed to be a digital hub for start-ups in the area. The centre was supposed to be self-funded, but has failed to attract the private cash injection it needs. In a statement, Media Labs Europe said the decision to close was taken because neither the Irish Government nor the prestigious US-based Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) was willing to fund it. Prime Minister Bertie Ahern had wanted to the centre to become a big draw for smaller hi-tech companies, in an attempt to regenerate the area. About three dozen small firms were attracted to the area, but it is thought the effects of the dot.com recession damaged the Labs' long-term survival. The Labs needed about 10 million euros (US$13 million) a year from corporate sponsors to survive. "In the end, it was too deep and too long a recession," said Simon Jones, the Labs' managing director. Ian Pearson, BT's futurologist, told the Online News News website that the closure was a "real shame". BT was just one of the companies that had worked with the Labs, looking at RFID tag developments and video conferencing. "There were a lot of very talented, creative people there and they came up with some great ideas that were helping to ensure greater benefits of technology for society. "I have no doubt that the individuals will be quickly snapped up by other research labs, but the synergies from them working as a team will be lost." Noel Dempsey, the government's communications minister, said Mr Ahern had been "very committed" to the project. "He is, I know, very disappointed it has come to this. At the time it seemed to be the right thing to do," he said. "Unfortunately the model is not a sustainable one in the current climate." During its five years, innovative and some unusual ideas for technologies were developed. In recent months, 14 patent applications had been filed by the Labs. Many concepts fed into science, engineering, and psychology as well as technology, but it is thought too few of the ideas were commercially viable in the near-term. Several research teams explored how which humans could react with technologies in ways which were entirely different. The Human Connectedness group, for example, developed the iBand, a bracelet which stored and exchanged information about you and your relationships. This information could be beamed to another wearer when two people shook hands. Other projects looked at using other human senses, like touch, to interact with devoices which could be embedded in the environment, or on the body itself. One project examined how brainwaves could directly control a computer game. The Labs, set up in an old Guinness brewery, housed around 100 people, made up of staff, researchers, students, collaborators and part-time undergraduate students. It is thought more than 50 people will lose their jobs when the Labs close on 1 February. According to its latest accounts, Media Lab Europe said it spent 8.16 million euros (about US$10.6 million) in 2003 and raised just 2.56 million euros (US$3.3 million).

EU software patent law delayed EU software patent law delayed Controversial new EU rules for the patenting of computer-based inventions have been put on hold due to a last minute intervention from Poland. Poland - a large and therefore crucial EU member - has requested more time to consider the issue, especially as it relates to the patenting of software. Critics say the law would favour large companies over small, innovative ones. They say it could have massive ramifications for developments such as open source software. Polish ministers want to see the phrasing of the text of the Directive on the Patentability of Computer-Implemented Inventions changed so that it excludes the patenting of software. The planned law has ignited angry debate about whether the EU should allow the patenting of computer programs and internet business methods as currently happens in the US. So, for instance, US-based Amazon.com holds a patent on 'one-click shopping'. Critics claim the law, which the EU says is needed to harmonise with the US, is little more than a law on ideas. "Patent rights, it is claimed, protect inventors but in this case it is exclusively the interests of the big companies that are protected," Eva Lichtenberg, a Austrian Green member of the European Parliament said in a statement. "Smaller, innovative firms cannot afford the patenting and legal costs that the directive would inflict on them," she added. The European Parliament has already clashed with the European Union on the issue and there have been accusations that the process to decide the issue has been undemocratic. The directive has been subject to several previous delays. Return to results

Everton's Weir cools Euro hopes Everton's Weir cools Euro hopes Everton defender David Weir has played down talk of European football, despite his team lying in second place in the Premiership after beating Liverpool. Weir told Online News Radio Five Live: "We don't want to rest on our laurels and say we have achieved anything yet. "I think you start taking your eye off the ball if you make statements and look too far into the future. "If you start making predictions you soon fall back into trouble. The only thing that matters is the next game." He said: "We are looking after each other and hard work goes a long way in this league. We have definitely shown that. "Also injuries and suspensions haven't cost us too badly and we have a lot of self-belief around the place." Return to results
FA decides not to punish Mourinho FA decides not to punish Mourinho The Football Association will take no action against Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho following his sending-off in Sunday's Carling Cup final. Mourinho, who was sent from the touchline for appearing to taunt Liverpool fans, has been "reminded of his responsibilities to the game". But the FA confirmed: "There will be no further action taken in this matter." Mourinho claimed his 'silence' gesture was aimed at the media, although they were on the other side of the ground. The former Porto coach was forced to watch the climax of his side's 3-2 victory over Liverpool on television after being ushered away from the touchline by fourth official Phil Crossley. His gesture came after Chelsea's equaliser on 79 minutes courtesy of a Steven Gerrard own goal. Mourinho still faces an FA investigation into his allegation that Manchester United's players 'cheated' during January's Carling Cup semi-final at Stamford Bridge. And Uefa could also launch disciplinary action following Mourinho's failure to attend a compulsory post-match press conference after Chelsea's Champions League defeat at Barcelona last week. In addition, some time this month, Chelsea must also answer a charge of failing to control their players during the Premiership win at Blackburn in February. And a charge of failing to control their supporters following a Carling Cup meeting with West Ham earlier this season is still to be heard. The Premier League is also continuing investigations into allegations Chelsea officials tapped up Arsenal defender Ashley Cole in January. Return to results

Ferguson hails Man Utd's resolve Ferguson hails Man Utd's resolve Manchester United's Alex Ferguson has praised his players' gutsy performance in the 1-0 win at Aston Villa. "That was our hardest away game of the season and it was a fantastic game of football, end-to-end with lots of good passing," said the Old Trafford boss. "We showed lots of character and guts and we weren't going to lose. "I look at that fixture and think we've been there and won, while Arsenal and Chelsea have yet to come and Villa may have some players back when they do." Ferguson also hailed senior stars Ryan Giggs and Roy Keane, who came off the bench for the injured John O'Shea. "Roy came on and brought a bit of composure to the midfield which we needed and which no other player has got. "Giggs was a tremendous threat and he brings tremendous penetration. "All we can do is maintain our form, play as we are and we'll get our rewards." Comments are closed for this article.
Ferguson puts faith in youngsters Ferguson puts faith in youngsters Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson said he has no regrets after his second-string side lost 3-0 away at Fenerbahce in the Champions League. Ferguson said: "The good thing about being manager is that you are in control of which team to pick. "I care about United, that's important, so while I am disappointed at the result I am not at the team I selected. "This game was important for the young lads. They will remember it and next time they come they will be better." Ferguson admitted his side were well-beaten by the Turks, a result which meant they finished second in Group D behind Lyon. He added: "They'll know not to play like that again. We showed a lack of strength. But I have no complaints about the scoreline. "In the second half we had some good moments in attack. And in that situation, you have to take one chance. "But we didn't do that, so the game just petered out for us. "I didn't think it made much difference whether we won the group or finished second and I still don't. "We could get Inter, AC Milan and Juventus but Bayern, Barcelona and Real Madrid were among the runners-up. All we can do is let fate decide how it works out." Return to results
Five-a-day guide to keeping mind and body happy and healthy Five-a-day guide to keeping mind and body happy and healthy New evidence suggests key ways to support mental wellbeing, based on keeping brain and body active Gillian O'Brien The five-a-day for physical health which involves eating five portions of fruit and vegetables a day is a useful framework which we can borrow to help us in thinking about how we can be proactive in taking care of our mental health. The UK-based New Economics Foundation outlined five key ways to wellbeing based on up-to-date evidence about what promotes and supports our mental health and wellbeing. This is a five-a-day guide for minding our mental health. 1. Connect Our relationships with other people are fundamental to our sense of wellbeing and happiness. Our close relationships with family and friends can yield love, support and a sense of meaning in our lives. Our wider social networks create in us a sense of belonging. So it makes sense that we work on strengthening our relationships and on making new connections. For example, talking with others should be an everyday event. Conversations donât have to be all about the difficulties. We need to tell one other about the enjoyable events too. Knowing when to disconnect is vital too. Being fully present in the company we are in, without the distraction of phones, tablets and other devices, helps to deepen our sense of connection. The ever-growing number of ways in which we can connect with one another means that we are in danger of privileging the quantity of our connections over their quality. What helps you to grow healthy connections with people in your life? 2. Be active Experts have shown that exercising releases endorphins in our brains that make us feel good. Being active doesnât have to mean going to the gym, competing in triathlons or wearing Lycra. There are many ways to build activity into our daily lives and itâs about discovering something we enjoy doing and then building it into our routine. Engaging in exercise can present us with opportunities to meet new people, to engender a sense of belonging, to give us a much-needed break from a stressful day and, above all, to make us feel good about ourselves. Regular exercise is also linked to better sleep which, in turn, is important for helping us to maintain good mental health. Which ways of being active do you enjoy? 3. Take notice We can all get caught up in the relentless busy-ness of modern life. We can become intoxicated with the chatter of the mind. How often are we mind-full as opposed to mindful? Taking a few moments to focus our awareness on what is going on within us and what is going on in nature around us can work wonders for our mental health. It can free us up, even briefly, from dwelling on the past or worrying about the future. It can help us get more out of our day- to-day lives. What do you notice about where you are and how you feel right now? 4. Keep learning Learning exposes us to new ideas and helps us to stay curious and engaged. It may also give us a sense of accomplishment which, in turn, can boost our confidence. Learning does not necessarily have to involve lectures, books or traditional teaching methods. It can often take place through doing. For some, it might involve being shown how to Skype a loved one on the other side of the world, for others it is watching a documentary and for others still, it is experimenting with a new recipe. New learning can happen all the time if we are open to it. What have you learnt or tried out for the first time recently? 5. Give Doing good is good for us. Helping others makes us feel needed and valued; it can reinforce social connectedness and give us a sense of purpose â not to mention the benefits for those we help and the wider benefit to communities by contributing to a more compassionate society. Giving ranges from simple, spontaneous acts such as paying a compliment or holding open a door to more structured and significant commitments such as volunteering.

Gadget market 'to grow in 2005' Gadget market 'to grow in 2005' The explosion in consumer technology is to continue into 2005, delegates at the world's largest gadget show, in Las Vegas, have been told. The number of gadgets in the shops is predicted to grow by 11%, while devices which talk to each other will become increasingly important. "Everything is going digital," Kirsten Pfeifer from the Consumer Electronics Association, told the Online News News website. The Consumer Electronics Show (CES) featured the pick of 2005's products. "Consumers are controlling what they want and technologies like HDTVs [high-definition TVs], digital radio, and digital cameras will remain strong in 2005. "All the products on show really showed the breadth and depth of the industry." Despite showing diversity, some delegates attending complained that the showcase lacked as much "wow factor" as in previous years. The portable technologies on show also reflected one of the buzzwords of CES, which was the "time and place shifting" of multimedia content - being able to watch and listen to video and music anywhere, at any time. At the start of last year's CES, the CEA predicted there would be an average growth of 4% in 2004. That figure was surpassed with the rise in popularity of portable digital music players, personal video recorders and digital cameras. It was clear also that gadgets are becoming a lot more about lifestyle choice, with fashion and personalisation becoming increasingly key to the way gadgets are designed. Part of this has been the rise in spending power of the "generation X-ers" who have grown up with technology and who now have the spending power and desire for more devices that suit them. More than 57% of the consumer electronics market is made up of female buyers, according to CEA research. Hybrid devices, which combine a number of multimedia functions, were also in evidence on the show floor. "A lot of this is driven by just the ability to do it," said Stephen Baker, a consumer electronics analyst with retail research firm NPD Group. "Some of these functions cost next to nothing to add." As well as the show floor showcasing everything from tiny wearable MP3 players to giant high-definition TVs, several keynote speeches were made by industry leaders, such as Microsoft chief Bill Gates. Despite several embarrassing technical glitches during Mr Gate's pre-show speech, he announced several new partnerships - mainly for the US market. He unveiled new ways of letting people take TV shows recorded on personal video recorders and watch them back on portable devices. He disappointed some, however, by failing to announce any details of the next generation of the Xbox games console. Another disappointment was the lack of exposure Sony's new portable games device, the PSP, had at the show. Sony said the much-anticipated gadget would most likely start shipping in March for the US and Europe. It went on sale in Japan before Christmas. There were only two PSPs embedded in glass cabinets at the show though and no representatives to discuss further details. A Sony representative told the Online News News website this was because Sony did not consider it to be part of their "consumer technology" offering. Elsewhere at the show, there was a plethora of colour and plasma screens, including Samsung's 102-inch (2.6 metre) plasma - the largest in the world. Industry experts were also excited about high-definition technologies coming to the fore in 2005, with new formats for DVDs coming out which will hold six times as much data as conventional DVDs. With so many devices on the move there were a lot of products on show offering external storage, like Seagate's 5GB pocket sized external hard drive, which won an innovation for engineering and design prize. More than 120,000 trade professionals attended CES in Las Vegas, which officially ran from 6 to 9 January. Comments are closed for this article.
Games help you 'learn and play' Games help you 'learn and play' 'God games' in which players must control virtual people and societies could be educational, says research. A US researcher has suggested that games such as The Sims could be a good way to teach languages. Ravi Purushotma believes that the world of The Sims can do a better job of teaching vocabulary and grammar than traditional methods. The inherent fun of game playing could help to make learning languages much less of a chore, said Mr Purushotma. There must be few parents or teachers that do not worry that the lure of a video game on a computer or console is hard to resist by children that really should be doing their homework. But instead of fearing computer games, Ravi Purushotma believes that educationalists, particularly language teachers should embrace games. "One goal would be to break what I believe to be the false assumption that learning and play are inherently oppositional," he said. He believes that the "phenomenal ability" of games such as The Sims and others to capture the interest of adolescent audiences is ripe for exploitation. The hard part of learning any language, said Mr Purushotma, were the basic parts of learning what different words refer to and how they are used to build up sentences. Boring lessons drumming vocabulary into pupils couched in terms they do not understand has made many languages far harder to learn than they should be. "The way we often teach foreign languages right now is somewhat akin to learning to ride a bike by formally studying gravity," he said. By contrast, said Mr Purushotma, learning via something like The Sims may mean students do not feel like they are studying at all. This was because The Sims does not rely solely on words to get information across to players. Instead the actions of its computer controlled people and how they interact with their world often makes clear what is going on. The incidental information about what a Sim was doing could reinforce what a player or student was supposed to be learning, said Mr Purushotma. By contrast many language lessons try to impart information about a tongue with little context. For instance, he said, in a version of The Sims adapted to teach German, if a player misunderstood what was meant by the word "energie" the actions of a tired Sim, stumbling then falling asleep, would illustrate the meaning. If necessary detailed textual information could be called upon to aid players' or students' understanding. One of the drawbacks of The Sims, said Mr Purushotma, was the lack of spoken language to help people brush up on pronunciation. However, online versions of The Sims, in which people have to move in, meet the neighbours and get to know the local town, could be adapted to help this. Although not wishing to claim that he is the first to suggest using a game can help people learn, Mr Purushotma believes that educationalists have missed the potential they have to help. Getting a simulated person to perform everyday activities in a make-believe world and having them described in a foreign language could be a powerful learning aid, he believes. Before now, he said, educational software titles suffer by comparison with the slick graphics and rich worlds found in games. But, he said, using pre-prepared game worlds such as The Sims has never been easier because tools have been made by its creators and fans that make it easy to modify almost any part of the game. This could make it easy for teachers to adapt parts of the game for their own lessons. "I'm hoping now to re-create a well-polished German learning mod for the sequel by this summer," he told the Online News News website. "I'm encouraged to hear that others are thinking of experimenting with Japanese and Spanish." Earlier work with a colleague on using Civilisation III to teach students about history showed that it could be a powerful way to get them to realise that solving a society's problems can not always come from making a single change. A report on the experiment said: "Students began asking historical and geographical questions in the context of game play, using geography and history as tools for their game, and drawing inferences about social phenomena based on their play." Mr Purushotma's ideas were aired in an article for the journal Language Learning and Technology. Comments are closed for this article.
German business morale surges in November German business morale surges in November Morale at highest level since April 2012 in a sign that economy is steadily recovering Europeâs largest economy is showing signs of steadily recovering after a weak start to the year. Photograph: Francois Lenoir/Online News German business morale rose far more than forecast in November, reaching its highest level since April 2012, in a sign that Europeâs largest economy is steadily recovering after a weak start to the year. The Munich-based Ifo think tank said today its business climate index, based on a monthly survey of some 7,000 firms, rose to 109.3, beating the consensus forecast for a rise to 107.7 and surpassing even the highest estimate for a reading of 108.5. The November figure compared with a reading of 107.4 in October. The euro rose and German Bund futures extended losses after the index was published. (Online News) .

Google launches TV search service Google launches TV search service The net search giant Google has launched a search service that lets people look for TV programmes. The service, Google Video beta, searches closed caption information that comes with programmes. It only searches US channel content currently. Results list programmes with still images and text from the point where the search phrase was spoken. It should expand over time to include content from more channels, said a Google spokesperson. The first version of the service is part of Google's expanding efforts to be a ubiquitous search engine for people to find what they want on the web and beyond. "We think TV is a big part of people's lives," said Jonathan Rosenberg, Google's vice president of product management. "Ultimately, we would like to have all TV programming indexed." Google Video has been indexing US-based programmes from PBS, the NBA, Fox News, and C-SPAN since December. But there were few clues from Google about when more global broadcasters would be included. "Over time, we plan to increase the number of television channels and video content available via Google Video but don't have more product details to share with you today," a Google spokesperson told the Online News News website. The results thrown up by the search will also include programme and episode information like channel, date and time. It also lets people find the next time and channel where a programme will aired locally using a US zip code search function. Rival search engine Yahoo has been developing a similar type of video search for webcasts and TV clips which it promotes from its homepage. It offers direct links to websites with movies or other clips relevant to the search query, but does not pinpoint when the search query occurred. A spokeswoman told the Financial Times on Monday that Yahoo was adding captioning for Online News, Online News and BSkyB broadcasts. A smaller service, blinkx.tv, was launched last month. It searches for and links to TV news, film trailers, and other video and audio clips. Comments are closed for this article.
Gritty return for Prince of Persia Gritty return for Prince of Persia Still basking in the relatively recent glory of last year's Sands Of Time, the dashing Prince of Persia is back in Warrior Within, and in a more bellicose mood than last time. This sequel gives the franchise a grim, gritty new look and ramps up the action and violence. As before, you control the super-athletic prince from a third-person perspective. The time-travelling plot hinges on the Dahaka, an all-consuming monster pursuing our hero through the ages. The only way to dispel it is to turn back the clock again and kill the sultry Empress Of Time before she ever creates the Sands of Time that caused the great beast's creation. Studiously structured though this back story is, everything boils down to old-fashioned fantasy gameplay which proves, on the whole, as dependable as it needs to be. Ever since the series' then-groundbreaking beginnings on the Commodore Amiga, Prince of Persia has always been about meticulously-animated acrobatic moves, that provide an energetic blend of leaping preposterously between pieces of scenery and lopping off enemies' body parts. Those flashy moves are back in full evidence, and tremendous fun to perform and perfect. Combining them at speed is the best fun, although getting a handle of doing so takes practice and plenty of skill. Until you reach that point, it is a haphazard business. All too often, you will perform a stunning triple somersault, pirouette off a wall, knock out three enemies in one glorious swoop, before plummeting purposefully over a cliff to your doom. That in turn can mean getting set back an annoyingly long distance, for you can only save at the fountains dotted along the path. The expected fiendish puzzles are all present and correct, but combat is what is really been stepped up, and there is more of it than before. The game's developers have combined acrobatic flair with gruesome slaying techniques in some wonderfully imaginative ways. Slicing foes down the middle is one particularly entertaining method of seeing them off. Warrior Within is a very slick package; the game's intro movie is so phenomenally good that it actually does an ultimate disservice once the game itself commences. It is on a par with the jaw-dropping opening sequence of Onimusha 3 earlier this year, and when the game begins, it is something of an anti-climax. That said, the graphics are excellent, and indeed among the most striking and satisfying elements of the game. The music is probably the worst aspect - a merit-free heavy metal soundtrack that you will swiftly want to turn off. There is something strangely unsatisfying about the game. Perhaps precisely because its graphics and mechanics are so good that the story and overall experience are not quite as engaging as they should be. Somehow it adds up to less than the sum of its parts, and is more technically impressive than it is outright enjoyable. But that is not to say Warrior Within is anything other than a superb adventure that most will thoroughly enjoy. It just does not quite take the character to the new heights that might have been hoped for. Return to results
HIQA says thresholds, if implemented, will minimise number of people unnecessarily referred for surg... HIQA says thresholds, if implemented, will minimise number of people unnecessarily referred for surgery Dr MÃ¡irÃ­n Ryan, director of health technology assessment in Hiqa. Hiqa has recommended new thresholds for nine common hand and back conditions which it says, if implemented, will help tackle waiting lists for outpatient appointments and elective procedures. Reports, published on the Hiqa website yesterday, set out the minimum criteria a patient should meet before being referred for treatments or surgeries for conditions including carpal tunnel syndrome, trigger finger, degenerative lumbar spine disease and other back and hand injuries. Hiqa was asked to conduct the reports by the HSE, which will decide whether the recommendations contained in them will be implemented. Dr MÃ¡irÃ­n Ryan, director of health technology assessment in Hiqa, said the thresholds aimed to ensure that âthose with the greatest clinical need will have faster and more equitable access to surgical reviewâ, as well as reducing current waiting lists by minimising the number of people who were unnecessarily referred for surgery. She noted that, in August 2013 there were 52,000 people on orthopaedic waiting lists, a third of who were waiting for more than 12 months, while in April of this year about 300 patients were waiting for more than six months for back surgery. She said it was not anticipated that the thresholds would result in a drop in the number of procedures being carried and that the thresholds would instead streamline services. The complete list of procedures covered under the reports are: release of carpal tunnel; surgery for Dupuytrenâs contracture; ganglion cyst surgery; surgery for trigger finger/thumb; spinal injections for pain due to degenerative lumbar spine disease; surgery for adult degenerative lumbar spine disease; vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty for osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures; radiofrequency lesioning for chronic spinal pain and spinal cord stimulation for chronic pain.

HSE concerned at upsurge in gonorrhoea cases HSE concerned at upsurge in gonorrhoea cases Public health director says forms of infection may become untreatable in future False-colour transmission electron micrograph of Neisseria gonorrhoeae (gonococcus), the species of bacteria causing the sexually- transmitted infection gonorrhoea. The growing number of people being diagnosed with the sexually transmitted infection gonorrhoea in the State is a âcause for concernâ, the HSE has said. A total of 1,077 cases have been notified to date this year, compared to 1,110 for the whole of 2012. The HSE said the âmagnitude of the increaseâ in the Dublin , Wicklow and Kildare region was a particular worry with 817 cases diagnosed last year - 33 per cent more than in 2011. A similar trend is occurring in the UK. The development has prompted the HSE to establish a âan outbreak control teamâ which carried out âenhanced surveillance on all gonorrhoea cases notified during the first three months of 2013 in the East and South-East areasâ. It found that young heterosexuals and men who have sex with men were the two groups most at risk. The HSE said the proportion of cases seen in heterosexuals was âquite high at 44 per centâ of the totalâ. An information campaign targetting the groups is being run by the HSE over the coming weeks. âThis upsurge in gonorrhoea is a cause of concern, as untreated or inadequately treated gonorrhoea may lead to severe complications including infertility in men and women,â HSE East director of public health Dr Margaret Fitzgerald said. She said âemerging antimicrobial resistanceâ to gonorrhoea was a major concern and that it was possible some forms of the infection âmay become untreatable in the near futureâ. Dr Fitzgerald said some 50 per cent of women and 10 per cent of men with urogenital gonorrhoea may not be aware they have the infection. Unsafe sexual behaviour was a significant driver of the increase in cases of gonorrhoea and other STIs, the HSE said. On its website, the Health Surveillance Protection Centre recommends abstinence, a mutually monogamous relationship with an uninfected person and correct use of condoms as ways of avoiding gonorrhoea.

Half of UK's mobiles 'go online' Half of UK's mobiles 'go online' Multimedia mobile phones are finally showing signs of taking off, with more Britons using them to go online. Figures from industry monitor, the Mobile Data Association (MDA), show the number of phones with GPRS and MMS technology has doubled since last year. GPRS lets people browse the web, access news services, mobile music and other applications like mobile chat. By the end of 2005, the MDA predicts that 75% of all mobiles in the UK will be able to access the net via GPRS. The MDA say the figures for the three months up to 30 September are a "rapid increase" on the figure for the same time the previous year. About 53 million people own a mobile in the UK, so the figures mean that half of those phones use GPRS. GPRS is often described as 2.5G technology - 2.5 generation - sitting between 2G and 3G technology, which is like a fast, high-quality broadband internet for phones. With more services being offered by mobile operators, people are finding more reasons to go online via their mobile. Downloadable ringtones are still proving highly popular, but so is mobile chat. BandAid was the fastest ever-selling ringtone this year, according to the MDA, and chat was given some publicity when Prime Minister Tony Blair answered questions through mobile text chat. Multimedia messaging services also looked brighter with 32% of all mobiles in the UK able to send or receive picture messages. This is a 14% rise from last September's figures. But a recent report from Continental Research reflects the continuing battle mobile companies have to actually persuade people to go online and to use MMS. It said that 36% of UK camera phone users had never sent a multimedia message, or MMS. That was 7% more than in 2003. Mobile companies are keen for people to use multimedia functions their phones, like sending MMS and going online, as this generates more money for them. But critics say that MMS is confusing and some mobiles are too difficult to use. There have also been some issues over interoperability, and being able to send MMS form a mobile using one network to a different one. Return to results
Head of asset management John Mulcahy to retire Head of asset management John Mulcahy to retire John Mulcahy will retire from NAMA from the end of February next year.Photograph: Cyril Byrne / THE IRISH TIMES John Mulcahy , head of asset management and board member at the National Asset Management Agency (NAMA), is to retire from both positions from the end of February 2014. Mr Mulcahy will be succeeded as head of asset management by Mary Birmingham , currently a senior asset manager in the agency. The former chairman and CEO of Jones Lang LaSalle Ireland, Mr Mulcahy joined NAMA upon its establishment in December 2009 as head of portfolio management. He was appointed to the board of NAMA by the Minister for Finance in March 2012 for a five-year term and was appointed NAMAâs head of asset management in April 2012. Brendan McDonagh, chief executive of NAMA, said that Mr Mulcachy was a âpivotalâ presence at the property agency, and it would have been âvery much more difficult to deal with the scale of the challenge that we faced four years ago without the undoubted expertise of John who was, and is, widely respected in the property businessâ.

IMO considers invitation to LRC talks in doctorsâ dispute IMO considers invitation to LRC talks in doctorsâ dispute Kenny urges return to negotiating table as 3,000 doctors protest over working hours The Irish Medical Organisation has said it had received an invitation to attend talks at the Labour Relations Commission on the doctorâs strike tomorrow morning. A spokesman said the IMOâs non consultant hospital doctor committee would meet tomorrow to consider whether or not to accept the invitation. Doctors have called on health chiefs to see sense in the long-running dispute over working hours and avoid a second strike. Fifty-one hospitals were hit by a walk-out by 3,000 non-consultant hospital doctors with pickets placed outside at least eight hospitals for most of the day. Eric Young , IMO assistant director of industrial relations, said its members were united, strong and determined to see this campaign through to a successful conclusion. âWe will continue to try and minimise the impact of this dispute on patients but we must continue the campaign until the HSE sees sense and brings an end to this sorry chapter of the abuse of NCHDs and patients,â he said. The strike began at 7am and will continue until midnight tonight with hospitals operating at a Sunday standard. Scores of doctors picketed the Mater, Beaumont, St Vincentâs and Connolly hospitals in Dublin and outside the capital in Cork University, Tullamore, Portiuncula and the Mercy in Cork. The doctorsâ strike followed weeks of failed negotiations with the HSE over shifts that run for more than 24 hours. Taoiseach Enda Kenny urged the striking doctors to return to the negotiating table. âI would say the place to sort it out is at the Labour Relations Commission â not across the airwaves. Thatâs a tried and tested forum,â he said. Mr Kenny said the commission can resolve the dispute. âI do hope that this will be responded to in a positive fashion and hopefully can be resolved so that, understanding that we want to get to a point at the end of next year where the working time directive is fully implemented in respect of all the doctors and all the hospitals as should be many years ago,â he said. Doctors carried out any required transplant and dialysis service and the normal weekend palliative care and attended for patients undergoing active chemotherapy and radiotherapy which cannot be deferred. They maintained they had received exceptional support from the public and medical colleagues. Mr Young added: âI think everybody has seen that the responsibility for this sad state of affairs rests with the HSE and there has been huge support for our efforts to bring an end to the routine abuse of NCHDs.â Dr John Donnellan, of the Irish Medical Organisation (IMO), blamed the Health Service Executive (HSE) for the withdrawal of services. âResponsibility for this day of action rests fairly and squarely with the HSE who have abused the position of NCHDs for over a decade,â he said. âThroughout that time they have misled doctors, they have broken promises and commitments and they have ignored their obligations under EU law. âAs a result they are presiding over an unsafe working environment where the health of patients and that of our own NCHD colleagues is routinely put at risk.Today we are saying loud and clear â enough is enough we are not taking this any more.â About 12,000 outpatient appointments were cancelled as a result and about 3,000 operations postponed as a result of the strike.

Irelandâs âjunkâ status criticised amid second bailout warning Irelandâs âjunkâ status criticised amid second bailout warning Noonan says State cannot step in and out of aid programme âlike Laniganâs ballâ Former ECB president Jean-Claude Trichet has pre-empted any potential request to attend the Governmentâs banking inquiry. He told the Sunday Independent that the ECB made âcollegialâ decisions and it should be the governor of the Irish Central Bank, Patrick Honohan, who attended. Photograph: Hannelore Foerster/Online News Marie O'Halloran, Laura Slattery Trading in Irish Government debt will be boosted when bond markets open this morning following comments by credit ratings agency Moodyâs on Irelandâs fiscal progress and the Stateâs âdiminished susceptibilityâ to being cut off from the financial markets. However, the National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA) has criticised Moodyâs failure to lift Irish sovereign debt out of its âjunkâ status. Moodyâs changed its outlook on its Ba1 rating of Irish Government bonds from negative to stable, but did not give Ireland a credit ratings upgrade, in its latest report on Ireland, issued late on Friday. This prompted the NTMA to say it was âdisappointedâ that Moodyâs âdid not see fitâ to take Irish sovereign debt out of junk or âsub-investmentâ status, where it has languished since July 2011. Investment grade âMarket impliedâ ratings based on Irelandâs bond market pricing, also published by Moodyâs, suggest Irelandâs overall sovereign rating should be investment grade, the NTMA added in a statement. The Ba1 grade, one step below investment grade, compares with BBB+ rankings by the two other big credit ratings agencies, Standard and Poorâs and Fitch. However, certain classes of investors will only buy sovereign debt if it has been given an investment grade by all three agencies. Kristin Lindow, a senior analyst at Moodyâs in New York, told Online News that its outlook report applied to a 12- to 18-month time horizon, but that Irelandâs credit position would be continually monitored. âWe monitor ratings on an ongoing basis, so theyâre not subject to a specific cycle,â she said. Moodyâs report, which followed a meeting of its ratings committee last Monday, was published one day after Ireland officially emerged from recession. In outlining the reasons for its stable outlook, the agency also said it expected that there would be a âresumption of growth among Irelandâs major trading partners, particularly the UK and the euro area, along with continued expansion of the US economyâ. The credit ratings agency said this would support Irish growth, ârelative to its recent lacklustre performanceâ. An update on the health of the European economy will be published today, when the September purchasing managersâ indexes for the manufacturing and services sectors are released by Markit. The two gauges are expected to show an expansion in activity, according to a Online News survey of analysts. However, Fine Gael parliamentary party members were warned last week that the State may need a second bailout if Irelandâs major export markets suffer fresh economic slowdowns. Public debt Barclays Investment Bank chief economist Antonio Garcia Pascual told members at a private briefing that the sustainability of the Stateâs public debt of 125 per cent of gross domestic product was at risk if the EU, Britain or the US has to deal with a significant slowdown over the next two years. Moodyâs has said it expects that general government debt will level off relative to GDP. But it also includes the possibility of contagion from economic stresses elsewhere in the euro zone as a reason why Irelandâs credit rating might falter. Ireland must make a full and sustainable return to the money markets when it exits the troika programme, Minister for Finance Michael Noonan has reiterated. The Minister said Ireland cannot step out of a bailout and in again âlike Laniganâs ballâ. Meanwhile, former president of the European Central Bank Jean-Claude Trichet has pre-empted any potential request to attend the Governmentâs banking inquiry. He told the Sunday Independent that the ECB made âcollegialâ decisions and it should be the current governor of the Irish Central Bank, Patrick Honohan , who attended, although Mr Honohan had not been in place during part of the crisis. Mr Trichet said that âall our decisions being collegial, the president goes to the European parliament and the governors of Central Banks go to the national parliamentsâ. â (Additional reporting Online News) Comments are closed for this article.
Irish banks âwell-capitalisedâ, says Donohoe Irish banks âwell-capitalisedâ, says Donohoe Review of balance sheets seen as final major step for State as it seeks bailout exit Dutch Finance Minister and Eurogroup President Jeroen Dijsselbloem (L) and Luxembourgish Finance Minister Luc Frieden (R) prior to a Eurozone finance ministers meeting. Minister for European Affairs Paschal Donohoe insisted yesterday that Irish banks are âwell-capitalisedâ and âwell- scrutinised,â as euro zone authorities prepare to review balance sheet assessments of Irelandâs main banks. Speaking after the euro group meeting in Luxembourg yesterday evening, EU Commissioner Olli Rehn declined to speculate on the outcome of the tests, but said the Commission was working closely with the Irish Central Bank on the review. With discussions set to intensify between the Government and the troika following todayâs budget, the balance sheet assessments of Bank of Ireland , AIB and Permanent TSB are the main remaining milestone for the State as it seeks to exit its three-year bailout in December. Minister for Finance Michael Noonan is expected to meet with euro zone officials in Strasbourg and Frankfurt within the next few weeks before travelling to Washington for talks with the IMF. âWe need to see the outcome of the asset quality review in the coming weeks, to be 100 per cent sure about the exit mechanism,â a European Commission official told The Online News yesterday. The Government is expected to argue strongly that the results of the balance sheet assessment should be dealt with separately from a discussion on a possible precautionary credit line for Ireland , and that the State is well funded to deal with any potential capital issues arising in the banks from its own resources. Bank risk Earlier in the day, European Central Bank executive board member JÃ¶rg Asmussen said that the banks could be a risk for Ireland as it exits the bailout. Despite the success of the Irish bailout programme, the banking sector as well as the Irish deficit, which exceeds the European average, constitute âpending risksâ, he said. Speaking following the euro group meeting, the chairman of the euro group Jeroen Dijsselbloem said a final decision on an exit strategy for Ireland would be made at next monthâs euro group meeting. âAll options are open,â Mr Dijsselbloem said. âWe have a joint interest in making the access to market as successful and sustainable as possible.â Minister for European Affairs Paschal Donohoe said that discussions on a bailout exit strategy for Ireland would commence after the budget. âWhen that is complete the Government will then be engaging with the troika to evaluate all options in relation to exiting our bailout programme,â he said. He also stressed that the Taoiseach and TÃ¡naiste had already committed to making a âsustainable exitâ from the programme. Irish 10-year government bond yields fell to their lowest level in four months yesterday, following confirmation by Taoiseach Enda Kenny that Ireland would exit the bailout on December 15th, the day the IMF programme expires. Ireland is due to receive the last instalment of â¬2.3 billion from the EFSF by the end of the year, after the Troikaâs visit at the end of this month. Noting that Irelandâs bailout was due to come to an end in two months time, Commissioner Olli Rehn said that the programme for Ireland had contributed to its economic turnaround.

Irish exporters grow sales in 2013 Irish exporters grow sales in 2013 Weak domestic economy has forced firms to look further afield to sustain business Irish export firms reported a rise in sales for 2013, but warned that rising costs would hit business. Photograph: Michele Tantussi/Online News Almost two-thirds of Irish exporters grew their sales in 2013, a new report from the Irish Exporters Association has found. The report found that 62 per cent of firms selling outside the domestic Irish market had reported a rise in sales as companies sought to expand in territories such as China, Russia and Brazil. That compares with 58 per cent in 2012, with close to 80 per cent predicting a further rise in 2014 as Ireland leaves the bailout programme behind. The weak domestic economy has forced companies to look further afield, with 95 per cent of those surveyed claiming one of the main benefits of exporting was the ability to sustain their businesses. âMany Irish companies have learnt from the recession that they were over-reliant on a successful domestic economy. The sensible response to this has been to look overseas for new markets and thereby reduce vulnerability. Almost 70 per cent of the companies we spoke to have targeted new markets this year,â IEA president Colin Lawlor said. However, he warned there was no room for complacency âWe need to remain vigilant around our competitiveness, and access to finance remains an issue for many small businesses. We need to increase our efforts to encourage more Irish firms to export and to help them win business successfully overseas,â he said. One of the main concerns is around costs, with more than two thirds of respondents saying costs had risen in the past year, and 45 per cent claiming hikes in energy costs and other utilities will impair export capability. Some 62 per cent of exporters said access to finance has not improved since last year and 37 per cent said the lack of qualified staff was hindering business. Comments are closed for this article.
Keane returns to Republic squad Keane returns to Republic squad Manchester United skipper Roy Keane is back in the Republic of Ireland squad for the 9 February friendly against Portugal at Lansdowne Road. Keane was rested for the last game with Croatia in November but has been recalled as boss Brian Kerr prepares for a World Cup qualifier in Israel. Clinton Morrison, Stephen Carr, Andy O'Brien, Matt Holland, Andy Reid and Jon Macken are all back after injury. Chelsea winger Damien Duff is set to win his 50th international cap. Kerr has named a 27-man squad with the emphasis on getting the right blend between experience and youth. "This match is the perfect preparation for our next World Cup game against Israel in Tel Aviv on 26 March," said Kerr. "The likes of Stephen Elliott and Aiden McGeady have made excellent progress with Sunderland and Celtic in the last few months. "It is good to have players like them around to fit into the squad system if there are any injuries or suspensions."

Kenyan school turns to handhelds Kenyan school turns to handhelds At the Mbita Point primary school in western Kenya students click away at a handheld computer with a stylus. They are doing exercises in their school textbooks which have been digitised. It is a pilot project run by EduVision, which is looking at ways to use low cost computer systems to get up-to-date information to students who are currently stuck with ancient textbooks. Matthew Herren from EduVision told the Online News programme Go Digital how the non-governmental organisation uses a combination of satellite radio and handheld computers called E-slates. "The E-slates connect via a wireless connection to a base station in the school. This in turn is connected to a satellite radio receiver. The data is transmitted alongside audio signals." The base station processes the information from the satellite transmission and turns it into a form that can be read by the handheld E-slates. "It downloads from the satellite and every day processes the stream, sorts through content for the material destined for the users connected to it. It also stores this on its hard disc." The system is cheaper than installing and maintaining an internet connection and conventional computer network. But Mr Herren says there are both pros and cons to the project. "It's very simple to set up, just a satellite antenna on the roof of the school, but it's also a one-way connection, so getting feedback or specific requests from end users is difficult." The project is still at the pilot stage and EduVision staff are on the ground to attend to teething problems with the Linux-based system. "The content is divided into visual information, textual information and questions. Users can scroll through these sections independently of each other." EduVision is planning to include audio and video files as the system develops and add more content. Mr Herren says this would vastly increase the opportunities available to the students. He is currently in negotiations to take advantage of a project being organised by search site Google to digitise some of the world's largest university libraries. "All books in the public domain, something like 15 million, could be put on the base stations as we manufacture them. Then every rural school in Africa would have access to the same libraries as the students in Oxford and Harvard" Currently the project is operating in an area where there is mains electricity. But Mr Herren says EduVision already has plans to extend it to more remote regions. "We plan to put a solar panel at the school with the base station, have the E-slates charge during the day when the children are in school, then they can take them home at night and continue working." Maciej Sundra, who designed the user interface for the E-slates, says the project's ultimate goal is levelling access to knowledge around the world. "Why in this age when most people do most research using the internet are students still using textbooks? The fact that we are doing this in a rural developing country is very exciting - as they need it most." Comments are closed for this article.
Long life promised for laptop PCs Long life promised for laptop PCs Scientists are working on ways to ensure laptops can stay powered for an entire working day. Building batteries from new chemical mixes could boost power significantly, say industry experts. The changes include everything from the way chips for laptops are made, to tricks that reduce the power consumption of displays. Ever since laptops appeared the amount of time they last between recharges has been a frustration for users. A survey carried out in 2000 by Forrester Research found that the shortness of battery life was the most complained about feature of laptops. "The focus back then was more on performance and features," said Mike Trainor, chief mobile technology evangelist for chip giant Intel. "For most of the 90s battery life was stuck on two to 2.5 hours." But now, he said, laptops can last much longer. It was not just a case of improving battery life by squeezing more out of the lithium ion power packs, he explained. Other changes are needed to get to the holy grail of a laptop running for about eight hours before needing a recharge. "Lithium ion is never going to get there by itself," he said. "The industry has done a great job of wringing all possible energy storage out of that technology that they can." Some new battery chemistries promise to cram more power into the same space, said Mr Trainor, though work still needed to be done to get them successfully from the lab to manufacturing. He was sceptical that fuel cells would develop quick enough to take over from solid batteries even though they have the potential to produce several times more energy than lithium ion power packs. "In fuel cells you need to have pumps and separators and evaporation chambers," he said. "It's a mini energy plant that needs to be shrunk and shrunk and shrunk." Intel has been working with component makers to test energy consumption on all the parts inside a laptop and find ways to make them less power hungry. This work has led to the creation of the Mobile PC Extended Battery Life (EBL) Working Group that shares information about building notebooks that are more parsimonious with power. Some of the improvements in power use come simply because components on chips are shrinking, said Mr Trainor. Intel has also changed the way it creates transistors on silicon to reduce the power they need. On a larger scale, said Mr Trainor, improvements in the way that voltage regulators are made can reduce the amount of power lost as heat and make a notebook more energy efficient. Also, said Mr Trainor, research is being done on ways to cut energy consumption on displays - currently the biggest power guzzler on a laptop. Many laptop makers have committed to creating 14 and 15 inch screens that draw only three watts of power. This is far below the power consumption levels of screens in current notebooks. "If we can get close to eight hours that's a place that people see as extraordinarily valuable that's what the industry has to deliver," Mr Trainor said. Return to results
Microsoft co-founder bets on construction; Investment in FCC sees its shares rise sharply Microsoft co-founder bets on construction; Investment in FCC sees its shares rise sharply Bill Gates: JosÃ© Manuel Soria, Spainâs industry minister, told Spanish radio yesterday that the Gatesâ investment demonstrated that the countryâs economy now generated âgreater confidence and credibilityâ Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates has made a big bet on the recovery of Spainâs construction sector by becoming the second-largest shareholder in FCC , a Spanish builder hit hard by the collapse of a decade-long property bubble five years ago. Shares in FCC, whose main shareholder is the heiress and philanthropist Esther Koplowitz , rose almost 10 per cent yesterday to â¬17.20 after the company said it had sold 6 per cent of its treasury shares to funds connected to Mr Gates for â¬113.5 million. Spainâs government was quick to link the investment with rising confidence in the countryâs economy, with Madrid having recently raised its growth forecasts for next year in an expected exit from recession. JosÃ© Manuel Soria, Spainâs industry minister, told Spanish radio yesterday that the Gatesâ investment demonstrated that the countryâs economy now generated âgreater confidence and credibilityâ. The shares were sold at â¬14.86 each, a discount of 4.5 per cent to Mondayâs closing price of â¬15.56. Mr Gates, through a spokesman, confirmed the investment but declined to comment further. Spainâs large construction groups became symbols of their countryâs crisis after expanding rapidly during a decade of cheap credit and a building boom that collapsed from 2008 onwards. With Spainâs total spending on public works tumbling from â¬39.8 billion in 2008 to â¬7 billion last year these companies have been forced to refinance large debts and sell assets, while at the same time moving quickly to internationalise their businesses to compensate for the collapse of their domestic market. â Return to results
Microsoft releases patches Microsoft releases patches Microsoft has warned PC users to update their systems with the latest security fixes for flaws in Windows programs. In its monthly security bulletin, it flagged up eight "critical" security holes which could leave PCs open to attack if left unpatched. The number of holes considered "critical" is more than usual. They affect Windows programs, including Internet Explorer (IE), media player and instant messaging. Four other important fixes were also released. These were considered to be less critical, however. If not updated, either automatically or manually, PC users running the programs could be vulnerable to viruses or other malicious attacks designed to exploit the holes. Many of the flaws could be used by virus writers to take over computers remotely, install programs, change, and delete or see data. One of the critical patches Microsoft has made available is an important one that fixes some IE flaws. Stephen Toulouse, a Microsoft security manager, said the flaws were known about, and although the firm had not seen any attacks exploiting the flaw, he did not rule them out. Often, when a critical flaw is announced, spates of viruses follow because home users and businesses leave the flaw unpatched. A further patch fixes a hole in Media Player, Windows Messenger and MSN Messenger which an attacker could use to take control of unprotected machines through .png files. Microsoft announces any vulnerabilities in its software every month. The most important ones are those which are classed as "critical". Its latest releases came the week that the company announced it was to buy security software maker Sybari Software as part of Microsoft's plans to make its own security programs. Return to results
Millions to miss out on the net Millions to miss out on the net By 2025, 40% of the UK's population will still be without internet access at home, says a study. Around 23 million Britons will miss out on a wide range of essential services such as education and medical information, predicts the report by telecoms giant BT. It compares to 27 million, or 50%, of the UK, who are not currently online. The idea that the digital divide will evaporate with time is "wishful thinking", the report concludes. The study calls on the government and telecoms industry to come up with new ways to lure those that have been bypassed by the digital revolution. Although the percentage of Britons without home access will have fallen slightly, those that remain digital refuseniks will miss out on more, the report suggests. As more and more everyday tasks move online and offline services become less comprehensive, the divide will become more obvious and more burdensome for those that have not got net access, it predicts. The gap between "have-nets" and "have-nots" has been much talked about, but predictions about how such a divide will affect future generations has been less discussed. BT set out to predict future patterns based on current information and taking account of the way technology is changing. Optimists who predict that convergence and the emergence of more user-friendly technology will bridge the digital divide could be way off mark, the report suggests. "Internet access on other devices tends to be something taken up by those who already have it," said Adrian Hosford, director of corporate responsibility at BT. Costs of internet access have fallen dramatically and coverage in remote areas have vastly improved over the last year but the real barrier remains psychological. "There is a hard rump of have-nots who are not engaging with the net. They don't have the motivation or skills or perceive the benefits," said Mr Hosford. As now, the most disadvantaged groups are likely to remain among low income families, the older generation and the disabled. Those on low incomes will account for a quarter of the digital have-nots, the disabled will make up 16% and the elderly nearly a third by 2025, the report forecasts. Organisations such as BT have a responsibility to help tackle the problem, said Mr Hosford. The telco has seen positive results with its Everybody Online project which offers internet access to people in eight deprived communities around Britain. In one area of Cornwall with high levels of unemployment, online training helped people rewrite CVs and learn skills to get new jobs, explained Mr Hosford. Such grassroot activity addressing the specific needs of individual communities is essential is the problem of the digital divide is to be overcome, he said. "If we don't address this problem now, it will get a lot worse and people will find it more difficult to find jobs, education opportunities will be limited and they'll simply not be able to keep up with society," he said. The Alliance for Digital Inclusion, an independent body with members drawn from government, industry and the voluntary sector has recently been set up to tackle some of the issues faced by the digital refuseniks.

Minister due to dine with IMF managing director Christine Lagarde tonight Minister due to dine with IMF managing director Christine Lagarde tonight Eoin Burke-Kennedy, Arthur Beesley Minister for Finance Michael Noonan will meet International Monetary Fund (IMF) officials in Washington this evening amid uncertainty over whether the Government will seek a precautionary credit line when it leaves the bailout programme in December. With only seven weeks to go before Irelandâs official exit from the EU-IMF bailout, there is still no consensus in the troika or among European leaders about what sort of backstop might be provided to cushion Irelandâs return to the markets. The Government is keen to ensure any conditions attached to a credit facility should go no further than existing EU budgetary commitments. However, European sources doubt that would satisfy the European Stability Mechanism fund or the IMF. Mr Noonan was due to hold talks in the Washington headquarters of the IMF with its first deputy managing director, David Lipton. IMF managing director Christine Lagarde will meet the Minister for dinner this evening at Irelandâs embassy to the US. This follows Mr Noonanâs negotiations last week in Strasbourg with EU economics commission Olli Rehn, as well as discussions in Frankfurt with the European Central Bank and the Taoiseach Enda Kennyâs engagement with EU leaders at a summit in Brussels. With troika inspectors due in Merrion Street tomorrow for their 12th and final mission before the bailout ends in mid-December, the focus now is the terms on which any emergency credit line is granted. At issue is whether the Government can secure access to a credit line without accepting fiscal policy conditions which go beyond existing obligations under new EU budget rules. However, this is unlikely to satisfy either the IMF or the EU powers. While there is speculation in political circles that the Coalition will not accept a precautionary loan programme if the conditions are too onerous, Mr Noonan has kept all options in play. Having indicated during the summer that the Government would be seeking such a programme, it has rowed back from this position. The Government has large cash reserves in place anyway, so it could argue that access to an emergency safety net is not strictly necessary. To avoid any lack of clarity in the immediate run-up to December 15th, the Coalition expects to make a public declaration of its intentions some time in November. This timetable allows for the Cabinet to assess Mr Noonanâs talks, the troikaâs mission and the outcome of ongoing stress tests on Irelandâs banks. Safety net The aim in any declaration would be to provide certainty both to financial markets and the Irelandâs international sponsors, with whom any precautionary credit line would have to be agreed. The IMF and the ECB are keen for the Government to take on a programme precautionary credit line but they are insisting on compliance with tough policy conditions in return. Dublin would be obliged to submit to such conditions even if it never drew down money from this credit facility. Still, the EU commission sees no âobviousâ need for such a programme. Its concern is to avoid undermining the âsuccess storyâ of Irelandâs return to private debt markets at the end of the bailout. Any precautionary programme from the European Stability Mechanism fund would necessitate parliamentary approval in Germany and other euro zone countries. If proceeding in this manner, there would also be a separate IMF Return to results
Minister for Social Protection says revelations about CRC âextremely disturbingâ Minister for Social Protection says revelations about CRC âextremely disturbingâ The clinicâs fundraising literature states that although it is largely State-funded, it has a âsignificant annual shortfall which must be made up through voluntary donations and fundraisingâ. Steven Carroll, Pamela Duncan Charitable donations should not be used to fund âlavish salariesâ, Minister for Social Protection Joan Burton has said. Speaking at the Labour Party National Conference in Killarney tonight, Ms Burton said revelations about the use of donated funds to top-up salaries at the Central Remedial Clinic were âextremely disturbingâ. She said it was âvery importantâ that the organisation came out and clarified the issues that have been disclosed so far. Ms Burton said the CRC needed to provide details of its fundraising and additional sources of income and explain how that money is spent. âWhat happens after that depends on what they have to tell us,â she said. âI think they need to produce full accounting details and records and information in relation to it. Where it is inappropriate I would hope to see them change or modify that practice.â The organisation yesterday admitted that money raised by a charitable company had been used to top up the salaries of staff including its former chief executive. Five senior staff at the Central Remedial Clinic (CRC) are still in receipt of top-up payments. The organisationâs then chief executive Paul Kiely, who was on a State salary of â¬106,900 prior to his retirement, received a further â¬136,000 supplemented by the clinic. Ms Burton said the public needed assurances that their generous donations to charities were being used for the purpose they hoped when selecting a charity to give money to. This was particularly important in the lead up to Christmas, which was an important fundraising period, she added. âIâm sure there is a huge amount of concern about the revelations because charity donations are not meant to fund lavish salaries way in excess of what the Taoiseach of the country is earning.â The Taoiseach receives a salary of â¬185,350 annually. Earlier, Fundraising Ireland , an umbrella organisation for professional fundraisers including a number of well-known Irish charities, said its membersâ were reporting people cancelling their charitable donations as a result of the top up revelations. Chief executive Anne Hanniffy said the revelations were having a âdisproportionate and unfair impact on the funding efforts of charities and critically, people reliantâ on such charities âThis is concerning for hard-pressed organisations so openly reliant on public generosity and support,â she said. âIt is doubly concerning when the source of peopleâs frustration is an issue which has absolutely nothing to do with the way in which the vast majority of high quality not-for-profit organisations are funded and operated.â She said Fundraising Ireland believed transparency, accountability and regulation were vital to any healthy institution: âWe owe it to donors that their money goes where they expect it to go,â she said. .

Minister says Irish banks are âwell-capitalisedâ and have been âwell-scrutinisedâ Minister says Irish banks are âwell-capitalisedâ and have been âwell-scrutinisedâ Executive board member of the European Central Bank (ECB), JÃ¶rg Asmussen said Irelandâs bailout has been a âclear success story.â Photograph: Ralph Orlowski/Online News ECB executive board member Jorg Asmussen has said there are âpending risksâ for Ireland as it prepares to exit the EU-IMF bailout programme. Speaking ahead of a meeting of euro zone finance ministers in Luxembourg the senior ECB figure said it will be up to Ireland to decide whether to request a precautionary credit line to help its exit from the programme. However, there were pending risks, he said, specifically in the banking sector and in terms of its deficit, which is still âvery highâ compared to the European average. He said while Ireland, as well as the other programme countries, will be discussed at this eveningâs meeting, no decisions will be taken. The Government has indicated that it may not need to use a precautionary credit line when it exits the bailout at the end of the year. However, a decision on whether Ireland needs support will take into account the results of balance sheet assessments of Irish banks that are currently being undertaken by the Irish Central Bank and will be submitted to euro zone authorities by the end of the month. Addressing reporters on his way into the meeting, Minister for European Affairs Paschal Donohue said that Irish banks were âwell-capitalisedâ and âwell-scrutinisedâ. âThe government is participating in a very credible process in relation to this,â the Minister said. âWe have our asset quality review which is underway and will be concluding later on in the year to look at the quality of assets on the balance sheets of our banks. We will then be participating in a stress test in proximity to the European wide process next year. Our banks are well capitalised, theyâve been well-scrutinised. We will be participating fully in the process that is underway.â The Minister said that discussions on a bailout exit strategy would commence after tomorrowâs budget. âWhen that is complete the Government will then be engaging with the Troika to evaluate all options in relation to exiting our bailout programme,â stressing that the strategy was to make a âsustainable exitâ from the programme. While euro zone authorities are believed to be in favour, in principle, of Ireland exiting the bailout without a precautionary credit line, the results of ongoing balance sheet assessments of Bank of Ireland, AIB and Permanent TSB will be taken into account when negotiations on an exit strategy intensify later this month. Dublin is expected to argue the State is well-funded to deal with any potential capital issues from its own resources. It wants any negotiations on a precautionary credit line to be decoupled from the Irish bank stress tests, and is expected to reiterate that the review of the bank loans should run in line with the Europe-wide stress tests. This eveningâs meeting of euro zone finance ministers will discuss possible âbackstopâ options that are available to countries, ahead of next yearâs euro-wide banking stress tests. With EU finance ministers still locked in discussions about banking union, concerns are growing about how countries will deal with any capital holes revealed by stress tests. European finance ministersâ plans for a common resolution and recovery directive will not be implemented until 2015 at the earliest, while the European Commissionâs proposal for a single resolution mechanism, with a common fund to deal with resolved banks, is meeting staunch resistance from Germany.

Mobiles 'not media players yet' Mobiles 'not media players yet' Mobiles are not yet ready to be all-singing, all-dancing multimedia devices which will replace portable media players, say two reports. Despite moves to bring music download services to mobiles, people do not want to trade multimedia services with size and battery life, said Jupiter. A separate study by Gartner has also said real-time TV broadcasts to mobiles is "unlikely" in Europe until 2007. Technical issues and standards must be resolved first, said the report. Batteries already have to cope with other services that operators offer, like video playback, video messaging, megapixel cameras and games amongst others. Bringing music download services based on the success of computer-based download services will put more demands on battery life. Fifty percent of Europeans said the size of a mobile was the most important factor when it came to choosing their phone, but more power demands tend to mean larger handsets. "Mobile phone music services must not be positioned to compete with the PC music experience as the handsets are not yet ready," said Thomas Husson, mobile analyst at Jupiter research. "Mobile music services should be new and different, and enable operators to differentiate their brands and support third generation network launches." Other problems facing mobile music include limited storage on phones, compared to portable players which can hold up to 40GB of music. The mobile industry is keen to get into music downloading, after the success of Apple's iTunes, Napster and other net music download services. With phones getting smarter and more powerful, there are also demands to be able to watch TV on the move. In the US, services like TiVo To Go let people transfer pre-recorded TV content onto their phones. But, the Gartner report on mobile TV broadcasting in Europe suggests direct broadcasting will have to wait. Currently, TV-like services, where clips are downloaded, are offered by several European operators, like Italy's TIM and 3. Mobile TV will have to overcome several barriers before it is widely taken up though, said the report. Various standards and ways of getting TV signals to mobiles are being worked on globally. In Europe, trials in Berlin and Helsinki are making use of terrestrial TV masts to broadcast compressed signals to handsets with extra receivers. A service from the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation lets people watch TV programmes on their mobiles 24 hours a day. The service uses 3GP technology, one of the standards for mobile TV. But at the end of 2004, the European Telecommunications Institute (Etsi) formally adopted Digital Video Broadcasting Handheld (DVB-H) as the mobile TV broadcasting standard for Europe. Operators will be working on the standard as a way to bring real-time broadcasts to mobiles, as well as trying to overcome several other barriers. The cost and infrastructure needs to set up the services will need to be addressed. Handsets also need to be able to work with the DVB-H standard. TV services will have to live up to the expectations of the digital TV generation too, which expects good quality images at low prices, according to analysts. People are also likely to be put off watching TV on such small screens, said Gartner. Digital video recorders, like Europe's Sky+ box, and video-on-demand services mean people have much more control over what TV they watch. As a result, people may see broadcasting straight to mobiles as taking away that control. More powerful smartphones like the XDA II, Nokia 6600, SonyEricsson P900 and the Orange E200, offering web access, text and multimedia messaging, e-mail, calendar and gaming are becoming increasingly common. A report by analysts InStat/MDR has predicted that smartphone shipments will grow by 44% over the next five years. It says that smartphones will make up 117 million out of 833 million handsets shipped globally by 2009. Comments are closed for this article.
Mobiles double up as bus tickets Mobiles double up as bus tickets Mobiles could soon double up as travel cards, with Nokia planning to try out a wireless ticket system on German buses. Early next year travellers in the city of Hanau, near Frankfurt, will be able to pay for tickets by passing their phone over a smart-card reader already installed on the buses. Passengers will need to own a Nokia 3220 handset which will have a special shell attached to it. The system would reduce queues and make travelling easier, said Nokia. Transport systems around the world are seeing the advantage of using ticketless smartcards. Using a mobile phone is the next step, said Gerhard Romen, head of market development at Nokia. The ticketless trial will start early in 2005 and people will also be able to access transport information and timetables via their phones. Nokia has worked with electronics giant Philips to develop a shell for the mobile phone that will be compatible with Hanau's existing ticketing system. The system opens up possibilities for mobile devices to be interact with everyday environments, said Mr Romen. "It could be used in shops to get product information, at bus-stops to get information about the next bus or, for example, by being passed over an advert of a rock star to find out details of concerts or get ringtones," he told the Online News News website. He is confident that the trial being run in Germany could be extended to transport systems in other countries. "The technology offers access to a lot of services and makes it easy to get the information you want," he said. Comments are closed for this article.
More power to the people says HP More power to the people says HP The digital revolution is focused on letting people tell and share their own stories, according to Carly Fiorina, chief of technology giant Hewlett Packard. The job of firms such as HP now, she said in a speech at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES), was to ensure digital and physical worlds fully converged. She said the goal for 2005 was to make people the centre of technology. CES showcases 50,000 new gadgets that will be hitting the shelves in 2005. The tech-fest, the largest of its kind in the world, runs from 6 to 9 January. "The digital revolution is about the democratisation of technology and the experiences it makes possible," she told delegates. "Revolution has always been about giving power to the people." She added: "The real story of the digital revolution is not just new products, but the millions of experiences made possible and stories that millions can tell." Part of giving people more control has been about the freeing up of content, such as images, video and music. Crucial to this has been the effort to make devices that speak to each other better so that content can be more easily transferred from one device, such as a digital camera, to others, such as portable media players. A lot of work still needs to be done, however, to sort out compatibility issues and standards within the technology industry so that gadgets just work seamlessly, she said. Ms Fiorina's talk also touted the way technology is being designed to focus on lifestyle, fashion and personalisation, something she sees as key to what people want. Special guest, singer Gwen Stefani, joined her on-stage to promote her own range of HP digital cameras which Ms Stefani has helped design and which are heavily influenced by Japanese youth culture. The digital cameras, which are due to go on sale in the US by the summer, are based on the HP 607 model. The emphasis on personalisation and lifestyle is a big theme at this year's CES, with tiny, wearable MP3 players at every turn and rainbow hues giving colour to everything. Ms Fiorina also announced that HP was working with Nokia to launch a visual radio service for mobiles, which would launch in Europe early this year. The service will let people listen to radio on their mobiles and download relevant content, like a track's ringtone, simultaneously. The service is designed to make mobile radio more interactive. Among the other new products she showcased was the Digital Media Hub, a big upgrade to HP's Digital Entertainment Centre. Coming out in the autumn in the US, the box is a networked, high-definition TV, cable set-top box, digital video recorder and DVD recorder. It has a removable hard drive cartridge, memory card slots, and Light Scribe labelling software which lets people design and print customised DVD labels and covers. It is designed to contain all a household's digital media, such as pre-recorded TV shows, pictures, videos and music so it can all be managed in one place. The hub reflects the increasing move to re-box the PC so that it can work as part of other key centres of entertainment. Research suggests that about 258 million images are saved and shared every day, equating to 94 billion a year. Eighty per cent of those remain on cameras. Media hubs are designed to encourage people to organise them on one box. Ms Fiorina was one of several keynote speakers, who also included Microsoft chief Bill Gates, to set out what major technology companies think people will be doing with technologies and gadgets in the next 12 months. In a separate announcement during the keynote speech, Ms Fiorina said that HP would be partnering MTV to replace this year's MTV Asia music award. MTV's Asia Aid will be held in Bangkok on 3 February, and is aimed at helping to raise money for the Asian tsunami disaster. Comments are closed for this article.
Morocco 5-1 Kenya Morocco 5-1 Kenya Morocco thrashed Kenya 5-1 in a 2006 World Cup qualifier on Wednesday in Rabat.

Moving mobile improves golf swing Moving mobile improves golf swing A mobile phone that recognises and responds to movements has been launched in Japan. The motion-sensitive phone - officially titled the V603SH - was developed by Sharp and launched by Vodafone's Japanese division. Devised mainly for mobile gaming, users can also access other phone functions using a pre-set pattern of arm movements. The phone will allow golf fans to improve their swing via a golfing game. Those who prefer shoot-'em-ups will be able to use the phone like a gun to shoot the zombies in the mobile version of Sega's House of the Dead. The phone comes with a tiny motion-control sensor, a computer chip that responds to movement. Other features include a display screen that allows users to watch TV and can rotate 180 degrees. It also doubles up as an electronic musical instrument. Users have to select a sound from a menu that includes clapping, tambourine and maracas and shake their phone to create a beat. It is being recommended for the karaoke market. The phone will initially be available in Japan only and is due to go on sale in mid-February. The new gadget could make for interesting people-watching among Japanese commuters, who are able to access their mobiles on the subway. Fishing afficiandos in South Korea are already using a phone that allows them to simulate the movement of a rod. The PH-S6500 phone, dubbed a sports-leisure gadget, was developed by Korean phone giant Pantech and can also be used by runners to measure calorie consumption and distance run.
New nationalâs childrenâs hospital in Dublin may have âthemeâ New nationalâs childrenâs hospital in Dublin may have âthemeâ Architects interested in tendering for the project are to be asked to suggest themed designs Eilish Hardiman, chief executive of the Childrenâs Hospital Group, said research has shown a fundamental clinical benefit and better outcomes for children who are treated in this environment. Photograph: Eric Luke / The Online News Visits to the national childrenâs hospital in Dublin will take on an entirely different character if proposals to incorporate evidence-based design in the new structure are adopted. Architects interested in tendering for the project are to be asked next week to suggest themed designs similar to those adopted by hospitals in New Zealand , Australia and the US. The proposals will not only have to meet the demanding requirements of a state-of-the-art hospital but will also incorporate design elements not typically associated with medicine. Citing the example of Aucklandâs Starship hospital, Eilish Hardiman , chief executive of the Childrenâs Hospital Group (CHG), said research has shown a fundamental clinical benefit and better outcomes for children who are treated in this environment. âIt is about engaging them, involving them, curiosity, imagination and all of those things. âIt is evidence-based. It has been demonstrated through evidence-based design that if you create this environment the children are healing faster and they have better outcomes. Starship hospital features a rainforest theme while Melbourneâs award-winning Royal Childrenâs Hospital boasts a two-storey coral reef aquarium, installations by Australian artists and a meerkat enclosure managed by Melbourne Zoo. Ms Hardiman was speaking at the launch of a report commissioned by Ombudsman for Children Emily Logan on identifying how child-friendly healthcare and a culture for childrenâs rights can be developed across Ireland . Ms Logan said the complaints received by her office are often not about primary resources. âThey are often about interaction, they are about communication. They are about the experience of perhaps being treated not in a very respectful way or people not understandingâ. She said poor communication can quickly lead to conflict when the substantive issue is in fact âvery small.â The research, undertaken by University College Cork , identifies âbuilding blocksâ such as raising awareness of childrenâs rights in healthcare, developing and implementing standards on the rights of children in healthcare settings and listening to and using the views and experiences of children as the basis for action. The National Healthcare Charter for Children, also published today, identifies ten key principles aimed at ensuring that children receive high quality healthcare that is appropriate and acceptable to them and their families.

Newry to fight cup exit in courts Newry to fight cup exit in courts Newry City are expected to discuss legal avenues on Friday regarding overturning their ejection from the Nationwide Irish Cup. The IFA upheld its original decision to throw Newry out of the cup following the Andy Crawford registration row. ''A law firm will put a case forward for Newry FC, and see what the legal implications of all this is are,'' said Newry boss Roy McCreadie. ''This is a big issue, now that we have an appeal pending,'' On Wednesday, a fresh IFA hearing into Crawford registration saga, ruled that last week's original verdict had been correct. It meant that Bangor, beaten 5-1 by Newry on the field, will take on Portadown in the sixth round. Newry had claimed they had uncovered "fresh evidence", in respect of the dates relating to the registration. But McCreadie is not further annoyed that full details of Wednesday's meeting was not relayed to the club. ''Even to this day, we have as much information about what happened during the meeting on Wednesday as that told to the media. We are being kept in the dark,'' McCreadie told the News Letter . ''We want an explanation. There is no good sending us the same fax message the press people received. ''It's a real sad case. If we are not back in the Irish Cup after our appeal, and guided by our legal advise, we will seek to lodge an injunction in the courts to stop Bangor playing Portadown.''

No EU enthusiasm for banking union, says former Lenihan aide Ahearne No EU enthusiasm for banking union, says former Lenihan aide Ahearne Economist says banks do not want a banking union, because they feel governments protect their national banks Economist Alan Ahearne says governments do not want a banking union, because their banks buy their bonds, tend to lend into their economies and sometimes give low rates to politically popular domestic projects. Photograph: Dara Mac DÃ³naill Neither the governments nor the major banks in the euro zone are in favour of a banking union, the annual Dublin Economics Workshop, held in Limerick at the weekend, was told by a former government adviser. Economist Dr Alan Ahearne , who was an adviser to the Department of Finance during the last Fianna FÃ¡il-led government, said the banks donât want a banking union because they feel that governments protect their national banks. And governments donât want a banking union because their banks buy their bonds, tend to lend into their economies, and sometimes give low rates to politically popular domestic projects. He was speaking after a paper from Karl Whelan of UCD on Resolving Europeâs Banking Crisis, during which data was shown illustrating the low amount of credit being made available by banks across Europe to businesses and households. Prof Whelan queried whether stress testing Europeâs banks would be done in an objective way in a context where no one was sure what would happen if the results were too negative. The International Monetary Fundâs resident representative to Ireland for the past two years, Peter Breuer , said youth unemployment had âgone off the chartâ in many countries and there was a rise in negative attitudes towards the European Union . Yet political buy-in was needed if the reforms needed to deal with Europeâs problems, including the creation of a single resolution mechanism for banks, were to be processed. He pointed to the sharp fall in bilateral bank exposures between EU jurisdictions illustrating a reversal in the process of financial integration. Interest rates were highest in countries that were in the deepest difficulties, which was a major challenge to restarting growth. The key challenge to dealing with the crisis in which Europe found itself was to restore the health of its banking system. If the banks were to be restored to health, then a stringent asset quality review of the banks was needed. The quality of the review would be very important. He said the ECB has done a lot to try to alleviate the crisis and may have to do more, âespecially in relation to lending rates to SMEsâ. Economist Colm McCarthy said that designing a banking union when the issue of allocating the losses arising from the current crisis had yet to be dealt with, was at the heart of the problem.

Noonan postpones change to pay and file deadline Noonan postpones change to pay and file deadline Minister had proposed bringing forward the date due to requirement to frame an earlier budget Minister for Finance Michael Noonan who said the goal of introducing an earlier pay and file deadline remained. Photograph: Bryan OâBrien/The Online News Plans to bring forward the pay and file deadline for self-employed business and individuals have been postponed for at least a year by Minister for Finance Michael Noonan . In a brief statement today Mr Noonan said after consulting he had decided not to introduce changes for 2014. He said the intention to bring forward the deadline from the current date of October 31st remained, with the aim of providing more clarity around the annual tax take and to help with Budget Day moving to October. Mr Noonan said any changes would not now be made until the Finance Bill 2014 meaning the earliest they could take effect would be from 2015. Bringing forward the deadline had faced growing opposition among senior politicians from all parties. For many years, the pay and file deadline for the self-employed has been October 31st for manual returns, and three weeks later for online returns. Mr Noonan has indicated he wanted to move the date forward to either June or September, largely as a result of the earlier budget. TDs from Government parties, from the Opposition, and a number of professional bodies expressed strong concerns about the move, arguing that it would have caused cash-flow problems for self-employed individuals and small companies and caused disruption, as well as reducing the high level of accuracy of Revenue data on this cohort. The decision has been welcome by ISME which also called for a comprehensive consultation process before any changes were made. .

Noonan says decision on exit strategy remains âfinely balancedâ Noonan says decision on exit strategy remains âfinely balancedâ Minister for Finance Michael Noonan held his final meeting with senior figures from the EU and IMF yesterday in the Netherlands Sources in Brussels now expect Ireland to exit the bailout without a backstop in place. Officials believe that if Ireland deploys a one-year credit line, it will confront the same issue of market confidence when that credit line expires in a yearâs time. With market conditions currently favourable, and Irish bond yields hovering at 3.5 per cent, it is seen as preferable for Ireland to return to fully fledged market financing now rather than at a later juncture. A final decision on a request for a precautionary credit line may be made as early as next week, amid increasing signs that Brussels is prepared to back Ireland if it decides to exit its EU-IMF programme unaided. Hour-long meeting Both finance ministers described the hour-long meeting at the Dutch finance ministry as âconstructive.â While Mr Noonan said yesterday evening the decision on an exit strategy remained âfinely balancedâ. Unlike three years ago, at the time of the Irish bailout when contagion across peripheral countries was a primary concern, the decoupling of Irish government bond yields from the yields of other programme countries such as Greece and Portugal over the last year is assuaging concerns about contagion should Irelandâs return to full private funding spark market unrest. The fact that a request to draw down a precautionary credit line from the euro zone rescue fund, the European Stability Mechanism (ESM), would need parliamentary approval from a number of countries, including Germany , is also weighing on the decision. EU commissioner Olli Rehn said yesterday that while the decision on an exit strategy was âby and large for the Irish Governmentâ, Ireland was well-funded. âThe Irish sovereign is now well-funded with quite significant cash reserves that serve as a buffer,â the commissioner for economic and monetary affairs said, adding that Ireland was seen as âan economic turnaround,â with growth returning and improvements in the unemployment rate. Mr Rehn said last month that Ireland had a âvery good chanceâ of exiting the bailout without a precautionary credit line. Mr Noonan took some analysts by surprise last month when he told the Fine Gael annual conference that Ireland may exit the bailout without a backstop mechanism. Sentiment in Washington He repeated the sentiment in Washington last week following a meeting at IMF headquarters. Since then Irish bond spreads have narrowed, suggesting the prospect of Ireland exiting unsupported may not trouble investors. While Ireland is the first country to exit a joint euro zone-IMF rescue package â a landmark for the euro zone â a number of countries have exited IMF programmes without the use of a precautionary credit line. With the final troika visit to Dublin due to finish tomorrow, Mr Noonan may make a decision before next Thursdayâs meeting of all 17 euro zone finance ministers, in Brussels. Any decision on a precautionary credit line will be first brought to Cabinet in Dublin before being discussed by the euro group of finance ministers.
Northern exposure not so bad for Nama Northern exposure not so bad for Nama Nama has still quite a few cards to play regarding its assets in the North Michael Noonan believes that, while Nama is focused on shrinking its daunting balance sheet and honouring its commitment to Irish taxpayers, it is also very aware of the responsibilities it has in the North. âOnly buy something that youâd be perfectly happy to hold if the market shut down for 10 years...â That, according to Warren Buffett , is one of his golden rules when it comes to investments. But it might not be one that Minister for Finance Michael Noonan subscribes to when it comes to assets held by the National Asset Management Agency in the North. In fact, Noonan may be considering whether an opportunity might arise in the very near future for Nama to look at selling some of the property associated with its Â£3.35 billion loan portfolio locally. Nama has a difficult line to tread in Northern Ireland, one that is very politically sensitive at the best of times.It is fundamentally a vehicle designed to achieve the best results for the State on the assets it has acquired. Its objective is to get the best return for the Irish taxpayer. Therein lies the cause of some initial wariness about the role it would play north of the Border. There were perfectly natural concerns that it might be willing to sacrifice some assets to make a quick return without any regard to the impact on the local economy. To be fair to Nama, that has not happened. There have not been any of the feared fire sales and the agency has, if anything, adopted a more modest approach to asset sales than it has in other territories. Less distrust There is less distrust now but still a reluctance among certain members of the business community to embrace it fully. For a start, it has quite incredible leverage in the property market. That it is also providing vendor finance to potential buyers of commercial property has only served to strengthen its hand. The agency says it has approved in the region of Â£123 million to local debtors and is actively looking for other projects to fund. Noonan believes that, while Nama is focused on shrinking its daunting balance sheet and honouring its commitment to Irish taxpayers, it is also very aware of the responsibilities it has in the North. Speaking during a visit to Belfast last week,he said: âWe have a Northern Ireland Advisory Committee who advise the [Nama] board, who are very aware of the situation in Northern Ireland and who represent Northern Irelandâs best interests. No-one should have any concerns about how Northern Ireland is represented. I am very confident that Nama will make the right decisions.â Noonan was in Belfast to address the business community directly for the first time at a Confederation of British Industry event attended by nearly 400 people. He told local businesspeople that the plan all along was for Nama to proceed with phased asset sales in the North. But Noonan also said that, if âthe economy is rightâ, Nama could increase the pace of those sales. It is a move that would appear to be welcomed given what one local commercial property group, CBRE Belfast, has recently described as the upturn in âdemand for property investmentsâ. It believes demand for property investments is being driven by pricing âthat is below replacement cost in many cases and the comparative gap between property yields and interest ratesâ. Strong hand Either way, Nama has quite a few cards still to play if and when it decides to start releasing further assets in the North. Noonanâs message in Belfast regarding, not just Nama, but also other key issues, such as the local campaign to secure a lower rate of corporation tax, suggested business here has a friend just across the Border â one that will provide support and, in the case of Nama, potentially much needed finance that could help get Northern Irelandâs economy back on its feet again. .

Officials brief all-party Oireachtas committee Officials brief all-party Oireachtas committee The Department of Finance is of the view that the unemployment rate will continue to fall in 2014, down to slightly under 13 per cent from a high of 14.7 per cent in 2012. Photograph: Frank Miller The Department of Finance has revised its projections for Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth next year down from 2.4 per cent to 1.8 per cent, the Oireachtas Committee on Finance has been told. A senior official also said last night that Prof John McHale, chair of the Irish Fiscal Authority Council (IFAC), had written to the department last Friday saying its projections fell within an âendorsable rangeâ. The IFAC has a statutory and independent role in deciding whether or not it endorses the departmentâs forecasts. Fiscal assumptions It means the council is likely to endorse the economic and fiscal assumptions underlying the budget. Officials on the departmentâs macro economic side briefed the all-party committee on its assessment of the economic outlook that will underpin next weekâs budget. Minister for Finance Michael Noonan gave an undertaking to the committee that it would be privy to the same information that had been given to IFAC. John McCarthy, a finance official, told the committee that the projections for 2013 had fallen from 1.8 per cent at the time of last Decemberâs budget to 0.2 per cent as of mid-September. He also confirmed that the growth rate for 2013 now looked likely to be 0 per cent. On a positive note, it was noted that the exports of services, such as information technology, had shown growth. Household savings While household savings rates remains high, the department officials told the committee that there was some evidence it was beginning to fall. The department is also of the view that the unemployment rate will continue to fall in 2014, down to slightly under 13 per cent from a high of 14.7 per cent in 2012. .

Organisation set up to help businesses drive economic recovery in Cork Organisation set up to help businesses drive economic recovery in Cork Glen Dimplex chairman Sean OâDriscoll, Minister for Agriculture Simon Coveney and Quintas partner Yvonne Barry, who is chairwoman of the Cork Foundation The first two beneficiaries of the Cork Foundation fund will be announced at the organisationâs inaugural Foundersâ Dinner this Friday. The non-profit organisation was set up earlier this year to help Cork-based businesses that canât get finance elsewhere, and this week it will announce the first beneficiaries of its fund. The foundation, whose supporters include Glen Dimplex chairman Sean OâDriscoll, Vodafone Ireland chief executive Anne OâLeary, EMC general manager Bob Savage and Arthur Cox partner Padraig OâRiordain, aims to contribute to job creation and help businesses drive economic recovery in Cork. Chairwoman and Quintas partner Yvonne Barry said the foundation has a target to raise â¬5 million by connecting contributors from home and abroad directly to Cork businesses and community enterprises. âWe have been very surprised by the support and financial contributions coming in. We are targeting not just business leaders and companies in Cork for contributions, but also the Cork diaspora in America.â She said SMEs, entrepreneurs and community enterprises could apply for financial support through the foundationâs website. The Foundersâ Dinner will be held this Friday at the Rochestown Park Hotel in, you guessed it, Cork. The night will include key-note speeches from Minister for Social Protection Joan Burton , with global philanthropy guru Kingsley Aikins acting as MC. The Foundersâ Dinner will take place in conjunction with two key events in America which will be hosted by the Cork Foundation in Chicago and Boston. Return to results
PC ownership to 'double by 2010' PC ownership to 'double by 2010' The number of personal computers worldwide is expected to double by 2010 to 1.3 billion machines, according to a report by analysts Forrester Research. The growth will be driven by emerging markets such as China, Russia and India, the report predicted. More than a third of all new PCs will be in these markets, with China adding 178 million new PCs by 2010, it said. Low-priced computers made by local companies are expected to dominate in such territories, Forrester said. The report comes less than a week after IBM, a pioneer of the PC business, sold its PC hardware division to China's number one computer maker Lenovo. The $1.75bn (Â£900m) deal will make the combined operation the third biggest PC vendor in the world. "Today's products from Western PC vendors won't dominate in those markets in the long term," Simon Yates, a senior analyst for Forrester, said. "Instead local PC makers like Lenovo Group in China and Aquarius in Russia that can better tailor the PC form factor, price point and applications to their local markets will ultimately win the market share battle," he said. There are currently 575 million PCs in use globally. The United States, Europe and Asia-Pacific are expected to add 150 million new PCs by 2010, according to the study. The report forecast that there will be 80 million new PC users in India by 2010 and 40 million new users in Indonesia. Return to results

Photograph: Niall Carson/PA Previous Image Next Image Previous Images More Images About 100 people braved the cold and wet conditions in Eyre Square, Galway yesterday evening to pay their respects to Savita Halappanavar on the first anniversary of her death. They staged a candlelight vigil in memory of the Indian dentist who had moved to Galway with her husband but who died at University College Hospital last year a few days after presenting with signs of miscarriage. Her husband Praveen did not attend the vigil and spent the anniversary with friends. The Mayor of Galway, Cllr Padraig Conneely , attended and said that Savita would always be remembered in Galway. âThis is the city Savita had lived in, both she and her husband had made their homes here and it is important that we donât forget her,â he said. Show support Most of the people who gathered to honour her had never met her, but wanted to show their support. They lit candles around a photograph of Savita, and listened while a performer sang Nancy Spain, ending it with the words: âSavita, we will never forget your name.â A good friend of Savitaâs, Sunil Koppuri , said that friends and members of the Indian community in Galway were still trying to come to terms with her death. âIt is difficult today but we are always thinking of Savita. It is not easy, sometimes it feels like she is not gone but then we know it is true. We came today to remember our friend,â he said. Another close friend, Vishali Valluri, said Savita was an incalculable loss to all who knew her. âI still think she canât be gone. She was my very good friend and I miss her every day. We thought she would make it, I never thought she would die. Itâs still very hard every day but especially today,â she said. Cork vigil A separate vigil outside Cork Opera House was attended by more than 40 people. Maureen Considine , co-founder of Cork Feminista, who handed out candles at the vigil, said the passing of Savita had had a profound impact on Irish society. âWhen the first vigil was organised last year I turned to my partner and said âWe are going.â I felt that what happened to Savita could have happened to any of us.â Ms Considine described Praveen Halappanavar as an âamazing manâ. âHe has made the effort to continue to speak about this publicly at a time of great difficulty. He has been a profound gift to us all. This vigil is about remembering Savita and honoring the Halappanavar family. We want to show solidarity with them.â Joe Moore said Savita lost her life in a shocking and senseless manner. âPraveen has shown such strength and courage over the last 12 months.â Return to results
Poles play with GameBoy 'blip-pop' Poles play with GameBoy 'blip-pop' A group of artists in Poland has taken the cacophony of blips, boops and beeps created as players bash buttons on Nintendo's handheld GameBoy console to a new level. The Gameboyzz Orchestra Project has taken the game sounds to put together music tunes they have dubbed "blip-pop." Think of it as Donkey Kong meets Norman Cook, or maybe Tetris takes on Kraftwerk. Any way you slice it, the sound is distinct. All the sounds are made by six Nintendo GameBoys, with a mixture of older models and newer Advance SP handhelds. The Gameboyzz Orchestra Project tweaks the software a bit, and then connects the units through a mixing board. Jarek Kujda, one of the project's founding members has been into electronic music and video games, for a while now. "I was playing some experimental music and three, four years ago when I first used a GameBoy in my band as a drum machine," said Kujda. He realised that the console could be used as a rudimentary synthesizer. He wondered, if one GameBoy can make music, what would happen if he put six of them together? Kujda found five other people who were interested and the Gameboyzz Orchestra Project was born. "Gameboyzz Orchestra Project is more of an improvisational project," said Kudja. "We prepare some patterns before a concert, and then improvise during the concert." The group plays maybe four or five shows a year. Malgorzata Kujda, Jarek's younger sister and a fellow band member, describes a Gameboyzz Orchestra Project concert as a lot of noise. "For example, I make music with more hard beats and noises," she said. "But each of us makes another music, a different sound. And then in the concert we just improvise, and that I think is more fun for us." The Gameboyzz Orchestra Project admits they get mixed reactions from audiences. Some love the group's music, and others are not quite sure what to make of it. In the world of electronic music, these purveyors of blip-pop are not unique. But Jarek Kujda says they try to be unique. "We have lots of people making music on old school stuff, electronic old school stuff like Commodore, Atari, Spectrum," he said. "We want to play only experimental music, not cover songs. We're something like an electronic jam session." The Gameboyzz Orchestra Project's tracks are available online and the group hopes to make a CD next year. And they have sponsorship, courtesy of the Polish distributor of Nintendo products. The members of the Gameboyzz Orchestra Project do not expect serious competition anytime soon. A GameBoy Advance costs about US $200 in Poland these days, which is still way beyond the reach of most Polish gamers, or musicians.

Psychiatric nurse was abusive to colleague and slept while on duty Psychiatric nurse was abusive to colleague and slept while on duty Five other nurses were censured for their behaviour in the latest batch of published decisions and another had conditions attached to her licence to practise A nurse who was verbally abusive to a colleague and failed to care properly for patients while under the influence of drink and/or drugs has been struck off by the High Court. The Nursing and Midwifery Board of Irelandâs fitness-to-practise committee found duty psychiatric nurse Mary Maura Cremer OâBrien (Pin 88983) was incapable of performing her duties due to the effects of alcohol and/or drugs while working on the night of December 21st/22nd, 2009. She was confused and/or disorientated and verbally abusive to a staff nurse. That night, she failed to give patients their medication and âwent to bed and slept on dutyâ. Requested loan The committee ruled her name be removed from the nursesâ register, a decision later confirmed by the High Court. Five other nurses were censured for their behaviour in the latest batch of published decisions and another had conditions attached to her licence to practise. The board, when publishing the results of fitness-to-practise committee inquiries, identifies nurses only by name and unique Pin (personal identification number), and does not provide an address or place of work. Carina Girona Padua DeGuzman (Pin 88127) was found guilty of professional misconduct after she talked to a hospital patient about her personal and financial circumstances and requested a loan in February 2010. The following month, she went to the patientâs house and accepted a â¬200 loan from the woman. Mary Teresa Cummins (Pin 48422) was found to have taken Valium tablets on one or more occasions while working as a staff nurse from March 2007 to May 2009. The committee ordered that conditions be attached to her name in the nursesâ register. Falsified CV Joel Raja (Pin 106709) was censured after the committee found he falsified his CV and concocted an email purporting to come from a member of staff at the hospital where he wrongly claimed to be still employed. Marlon Galvez Picarzo (Pin 83837) was censured for failing to give patients insulin and to record their blood sugar levels on two dates in June 2011. Rezel M Deang Mara (Pin 93254), a clinical nurse manager at a nursing home, failed to monitor and supervise staff and failed to ensure staff were discharging their duties âadequately or at allâ. The committee ruled she be censured. Comments are closed for this article.
Reilly gives health officials more time on cuts plan Reilly gives health officials more time on cuts plan HSE officials given extra 10 days to finalise details of massive health cuts for next year Minister for Health James Reilly who today decided to give HSE officials an extra 10 days to draw up a service plan detailing where cuts will be made to meet a spending reduction of â¬666 million next year. Photograph: Alan Betson/The Online News Minister for Health James Reilly has given HSE officials an extra 10 days to draw up the service plan detailing the areas of the health service where cuts will be made to meet a spending reduction of â¬666 million next year. Dr Reilly said he will be informing the HSE about the time extension granted in a letter to be sent later today. He said he was granting the extra time in view of the âcomplexity of the situationâ and the fact that the plan is being drawn up earlier in the year than normal and wonât have to be implemented until the start of 2014. The Minister had a formal meeting with HSE bosses last week, at which they sought extra time to draw up the plan. The HSE is legally required to prepare a plan for the Minister within 21 days of the Budget, which meant it was due to be ready next Tuesday. The Minister has the power to reject any plan prepared by the HSE, which he did in 2011. This would trigger a further 21-day period during which the plan is revised. Dr Reilly said there was âabsolutely no questionâ of capital expenditure in health being cut in order to meet the savings target for next year. He said he was proud to be presiding over some of the biggest capital projects the Government was undertaking, including the new national childrenâs hospital, the relocation of the National Maternity Hospital from Holles Street to St Vincentâs Hospital campus and the planned move of the Central Mental Hospital from Dundrum to Portrane. Asked whether the planned upgrading of radiotherapy facilities in Galway and Cork would be affected by budget cuts, Dr Reilly said the service plan would set out precisely which items of expenditure were going ahead and which âmight be slower for other technical reasonsâ. Dr Reilly welcomed the communications campaign launched by the HSE earlier today to provide more information on the issue of medical card eligibility. He said the campaign had been devised at his request in response to public concern on the issue. Dr Reilly insisted there has been no slowing down in the issuing of medical cards, though he accepted there had been âteething problemsâ associated with the centralisation of the processing of applications. Asked why far fewer cards have been issued this year compared to last year, he said this was because a âhuge numberâ of cards were given out last year when a backlog of over 50,000 applications was cleared. âPeople need full information around medical cards. They are naturally worried and become anxious when they canât get full access to all the facts they need. I welcome this major campaign being rolled out by the HSE over the coming weeks which I hope will help explain clearly peopleâs entitlements and may ease the fears of those who have been worried unnecessarily. âNo one who is entitled to a medical card need worry. Despite the significant savings to be made by the HSE in the year ahead, nobody who is entitled to a medical card will lose it or be refused one.â The HSEâs plan includes extra resources for the national call centre dealing with medical card enquiries, media advertisements, a new information leaflet, improved support on the HSE website and more training for frontline staff.

Researchers examine 30,000 women at Irish hospital between 2008 and 2011 Researchers examine 30,000 women at Irish hospital between 2008 and 2011 Researchers examined 30,000 women who gave birth at a hospital in Ireland which caters for both private and public-funded patients between 2008 and 2011. Around one in five of the women paid for their treatment themselves. Photograph: Katie Collins/PA Wire Private patients are twice as likely to have pre-planned Caesarean sections as women whose treatment is publicly funded, according to new figures that lend support to the theory that some mothers are âtoo posh to pushâ. Twenty-one per cent of private patients have a scheduled C-section compared to just 8.9 per cent of publicly funded ones, the study found. Researchers examined 30,000 women who gave birth at a hospital in Ireland which caters for both private and public-funded patients between 2008 and 2011. Around one in five of the women paid for their treatment themselves. The research, published in the journal BMJ Open, found that, overall, 34.4 per cent of privately paying mothers had a C-section compared to 22.5 per cent of public patients. âGreatest disparityâ The âgreatest disparityâ noted between the mothers was the rates of scheduled C-sections, the study found. For first-time mothers, 11.9 per cent of private patients had pre-planned surgery compared to just 4.6 per cent of those whose care was paid for by the public purse. âWe found that private patients are more likely than public patients to have an operative vaginal delivery or a Caesarean section. âThe greatest disparity is for scheduled Caesarean sections, and two-fold differences persist even after adjustment for socio-demographic, medical and obstetric factors. âWe found that the differences observed in relation to operative deliveries were not explained by higher rates of medical or obstetrical complications among private patients, although like other studies some of the disparity could be attributed to differences in maternal age and socio-economic status.â The authors said it was not possible to determine whether the decision to give birth via C-section was driven by the expectant mother or the doctors caring for them. Like any surgery, a Caesarean section carries a certain amount of risk - such as the wound becoming infected or the baby developing breathing difficulties. It also takes longer to recover from than a vaginal birth. The UKâs Royal College of Midwives (RCM) said the study highlights the need to avoid âunnecessaryâ Caesarean sections. Janine Stockdale , research fellow at the RCM, said: âThis is interesting research that may throw a spotlight on the high rates of Caesarean sections that we are seeing in western Europe including the UK, a number that we would like to see falling. âThe findings also underline the need to avoid unnecessary Caesarean sections, as this is a major surgical operation that has the potential for increased complications every time a woman has the procedure carried out. âThe RCM therefore supports National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidelines which encourage women to have a thorough discussion with their obstetricians and midwives about the implications of having a Caesarean section, especially in circumstances where other options remain open to them.â Press Association
Rings of steel combat net attacks Rings of steel combat net attacks Gambling is hugely popular, especially with tech-savvy criminals. Many extortionists are targeting net-based betting firms and threatening to cripple their websites with deluges of data unless a ransom is paid. But now deep defences are being put in place by some of the UK's biggest net firms to stop these attacks. Increasing numbers of attacks and the huge amounts of data being used to try to bump a site off the web are prompting firms to adopt the measures. "Net firms are realising that it's not just about anti-virus and firewalls," said Paul King, chief security architect at Cisco. "There are more things that can be done in the network to protect data centres." Mr King said the only way to properly combat these so-called Distributed Denial-of-Service attacks was with intelligent net-based systems. Many of the gambling sites suffering DDoS attacks are in offshore data and hosting centres, so any large scale data flood could knock out access to many more sites than just the one the criminals were targeting, said Mr King. This overspill effect was only likely to grow as attacks grow in size and scale. Malcolm Seagrave, security expert at Energis, said the most common types of attacks hit sites with 10 megabytes of data over short periods of time. Bigger attacks sending down 200 megabytes of traffic or more were rarely seen, he said. "It does feel like they are turning the dial because you see this traffic gradually growing," he said. So far there have been no attacks involving gigabytes of data, said Mr Seagrave. However, he added that it was only a matter of time before such large attacks were mounted. Maria Capella, spokeswoman for net provider Pipex, said that when DDoS attacks were at their height, customers were getting hit every four to five days. The defences being put in place constantly monitor the streams of data flowing across networks and pluck out the traffic destined for target sites. "It's about understanding what's genuine traffic and keeping attack traffic from going to the site," she said. "We study the profile of their traffic and as soon as we see an anomaly in the profile that's when we start to get the backbone engineering boys to see if we are going to sustain an attack," said Ms Capella. This traffic can be hard to spot because DDoS attacks typically use thousands of computers in many different countries, each participating machine only sends a small part of the entire data flood. Typically these computers have been infected by a virus or worm which reports its success and the net address of compromised machines back to the malicious hacker or hi-tech criminal that set off the virus. Hijacked computers are known as zombies or 'bots and collections of them are called 'bot nets. Many spammers rent out 'bot nets to help them anonymously send junk mail. Most of the zombies are based outside the country that hosts the target site so getting the attacking PCs shut off can be difficult. Often Pipex and other net suppliers do get advance notice that an attack is about to happen. "The serious players tend to precede an attack with some kind of ransom e-mail," said Ms Capella. "We ask, as part of the service we provide, that customers notify us of anything they have in advance that would give us forewarning." Once an attack is spotted dedicated net hardware takes over to remove the attack traffic and ensure that sites stay up. Energis took a similar approach, said Mr Seagrave. "We have technology out there that allows us to detect attacks in minutes rather than let network engineers spend hours pulling the information together," said Mr Seagrave. Also net firms were starting to work more closely together on the problem of DDoS attacks and pool information about where they are coming from. Information gathered on attacks and where they originated has led to some arrests. He said Energis also did its own intelligence work to get in insight into which sites criminal gangs plan to target. "We have people in places where they shouldn't be, monitoring tech sites," he said. Sometimes though, he said, spotting the next victim was easy. "You can see them going alphabetically through the list with the gambling sites, trying one after another," said Mr Seagrave. Return to results
Rivals back anti-racism campaign Rivals back anti-racism campaign Manchester United and Arsenal players will wear black and white wristbands when they face each other on Tuesday as part of a new anti-racism initiative. Launching the 'Stand Up, Speak Up' scheme with Thierry Henry, United's Rio Ferdinand said football's ruling bodies should do more to tackle racist abuse. "If an offence is committed, they should make a stand against it before the players do," Ferdinand said. "It should be up to the authorities to come forward." Ferdinand added: "It is a massive issue that needs to be jumped on and addressed. "It is a bit sad that it has taken the initiative of a player to push this issue forward." Henry became involved with the campaign following comments directed at him last year by Luis Aragones. Ferdinand claimed he was surprised by the lack of action taken against the Spain coach, saying: "I think if it had been the England manager who had said something like that, he wouldn't be in a job now."

Robertson out to retain Euro lure Robertson out to retain Euro lure Hearts manager John Robertson hopes a place in the knock-out stages of the Uefa Cup could help keep some of his out-of-contract players at the club. "It could help. If we get through and have another European tie it may encourage players to stay at least until the end of the season," he said. "If we manage to get through it shows how well the club's progressing. "They have to think whether they are going to get other clubs like that should they decide to move on." A win for Robertson's side against Ferencvaros would put them through to the last 32 if Basle fail to beat Feyenoord. "It's very much the player's prerogative but the fact that we've been playing European football for the last three or four years is obviously an incentive," added Robertson. "But we want players who want to play for the football club, who are committed and a run in Europe always helps a little bit." With the game being played at Murrayfield instead of Tynecastle because of Uefa regulations, Robertson sees both positive and negative aspects to the change of venue. "The pitch is not in the greatest condition. The Heineken Cup game was there at the weekend and the pitch is a bit threadbare," he said. "It's not ideal but it's the same for both teams so we just have to go out and there and perform. That's the most important thing." But he added: "If Tynecastle could have hosted 30,000 it would have been fantastic but that's one of the benefits of Murrayfield - it allows us to bring even more of our supporters into it. "There will be a good atmosphere and the Hearts fans have an important role to play. "We need their encouragement, we need them to get right behind the side and make it as good an atmosphere as possible. "Hopefully the players will respond to that and I know they will because it's a fantastic European night for the club." Return to results
Robotic pods take on car design Robotic pods take on car design A new breed of wearable robotic vehicles that envelop drivers are being developed by Japanese car giant Toyota. The company's vision for the single passenger in the 21st Century involves the driver cruising by in a four-wheeled leaf-like device or strolling along encased in an egg-shaped cocoon that walks upright on two feet. Both these prototypes will be demonstrated, along with other concept vehicles and helper robots, at the Toyota stand at the Expo 2005 in Aichi, Japan, in March 2005. The models are being positioned as so-called personal mobility devices, which have few limits. The open leaf-like "i-unit" vehicle is the latest version of the concept which the company introduced last year. Built using environmentally friendly plant-based materials, the single passenger unit is equipped with intelligent transport system technologies that allow for safe autopilot driving in specially equipped lanes. The model allows the user to make tight on-the-spot turns, move upright amongst other people at low speeds and can be easily switched into a reclining position at higher speeds. Body colours can be customized to suit individual preferences and a personal recognition system offers both information and music. Also on display at the show will be the egg-shaped "i-foot". This is a two-legged mountable robot like device that can be controlled with a joystick. Standing at a height of well over seven feet (2.1 metres), the unit can walk along at a speed of about 1.35km/h (0.83mph) and navigate staircases into the bargain. Mounting and dismounting is accomplished with the aid of the bird-like legs that bend over backwards. "They are clearly what we call concept vehicles, innovative ideas which have yet to be transformed into potential products and which are a few years away from actual production," said Dr David Gillingwater from the Transport Studies Group at Loughborough University. "They clearly have eye-catching appeal, which is in part the name of the game here, and are linked to the iMac and iPod-type niche which Apple have been responsible for developing and leading in recent years - new, different, hi-tech, image conscious products. "As always with these concept vehicles, it is difficult to see 'who' they would appeal to and what their role would be in the 'personal transport' marketplace." The personal transport arena is taking on a new dimension though with futuristic devices that augment human capabilities. Toyota's prototypes represent the latest incarnation of wearable exoskeletons in a vehicular form that is specially focused on transport. Powered robotic exoskeletons have been the focus of much US military research over the years and Japan seems to have jumped onto the bandwagon with a wave of products being developed for specific applications. With an emerging range of devices targeted towards the ageing world population, care giving and the military, wearable exoskeletons seem to represent a new line of future technologies that meet an individual's particular mobility needs. While Toyota's prototypes are geared towards mass transport, the company says that the vehicles will allow the elderly and the disabled to achieve independent mobility. Experts, though, are a bit sceptical of their acceptance in this area. "Those with arguably the greatest needs for this sort of assistance, now and certainly in the future, are the elderly and infirm people," Dr Gillingwater told the Online News News website. "You have to ask whether these sorts of vehicles will appeal to these groups." Design considerations also exist. Dr Erel Avineri, of the Centre for Transport and Society at the University of the West of England in Bristol said: "The design of the introduced mobility devices is not completely adjusted to the specific needs of the elderly and the disabled. "For example, one problem that many older passengers experience is limited ability to rotate the neck and upper body, making it difficult to look to the side and back when backing up. "It looks like the visual design of the device interior does not consider this need. This and other human-factors related issues in the design of such devices are not the only issues that should be considered," said Dr Avineri. "In general, introducing a new technology requires the passenger to change behaviour patterns that have served the older passenger for decades. Elderly users might not necessarily accept such innovation. "This may be another barrier to the commercial success of such a vehicle." Such single-person vehicles may find a relatively small market niche and may be more suited towards specialised applications rather than revolutionising the face of mass transport. "The concept of personal mobility behind these sorts of innovations is great but they beg a huge number of questions," said Dr Gillingwater. "What's their range? How user-friendly will they really be? What infrastructure will be required to allow these vehicles to be used. "Overall I think these vehicles pose a number of important questions than provide answers or solutions." Comments are closed for this article.
Rovers reject third Ferguson bid Rovers reject third Ferguson bid Blackburn have rejected a third bid from Rangers for Scotland captain Barry Ferguson, Online News Sport has learnt. It is thought Blackburn want Â£6m for the midfielder but chief executive John Williams has confirmed the club are still "in dialogue" with Rangers. The 26-year-old has already handed in a transfer request at Ewood Park as he seeks a return to Ibrox. But the clubs have been unable to reach agreement over a fee for Ferguson, who moved to Lancashire in 2003 for Â£6.5m. On Thursday Rangers said they would not be increasing their offer of Â£4m. Blackburn have said all along that they want Â£6m for the midfielder and Williams has rejected proposals from Rangers over a player-swap deal. Williams said: "We are in dialogue with Glasgow Rangers but we have no agreement." The negotiations will have to be concluded by midnight on Monday, when the winter transfer window shuts. Williams conceded any deal for Ferguson was looking "unlikely" before the close of the transfer window but Rangers still had a chance to seal the deal. "We have no comment to make other than we have not got an agreement with Glasgow Rangers," he added. "The way things are looking, I think it is unlikely we are going to. "The ball is in their court but we have not got an offer that is acceptable at this moment." It is understood that Blackburn accepted a Â£5m offer for Ferguson from Everton at the weekend. But the player is determined to return to Scotland and rejected a move to Goodison Park. Ferguson did not play in the FA Cup win over Colchester on Saturday despite recovering from a groin injury with Rovers boss Mark Hughes claiming it had been an "emotional and difficult time" for the player.

SPD finance ministers used letter-box companies for pension fund securitisation SPD finance ministers used letter-box companies for pension fund securitisation Peer Steinbrueck: both he and his Social Democratic Party have been particularly vocal critics of Irelandâs tax laws. Photograph: Johannes Eisele/AFP/Getty Images German politician Peer SteinbrÃ¼ck â one of the fiercest critics of Irelandâs tax regime â used Irish letter box companies when finance minister to try to balance the German budget through financial engineering. Mr SteinbrÃ¼ck â an unsuccessful candidate in the recent German election â and his Social Democratic Party (SPD) have been particularly vocal critics of Irelandâs tax laws. He used the recent election campaign to attack failed finance market alchemy and condemn âtax oasesâ such as Ireland and the Netherlands. According to this morningâs Der Spiegel magazine, Berlin began doing business in Ireland to tap into pension funds of Germanyâs post office, which was privatised and broken up in 1995 into three companies for telecoms, post and post office bank. Pension obligations At the time of the privatisation, the German federal government agreed to shoulder the companiesâ existing looming pension obligations while the three newly privatised companies were obliged to pay some â¬20 billion until 2042. This deal was forgotten for a decade until 2005, when Mr SteinbrÃ¼ckâs predecessor as finance minister, SPD man Hans Eichel , struggled to reduce Germanyâs deficit below the prescribed EU ceiling of 3 per cent of gross domestic product. Investment bankers hired by Berlin identified the future income to the pension fund from the privatised companies as an asset and recommended selling it off â a process known as securitisation â through an Irish letter box firm. Pensions contribution The company was set up, the asset sold and Berlin used some â¬8 billion earned to replace its own pensions contribution from 2005 to 2007. Its hope of reducing its outgoings â and deficit â fell foul of the European Commission . Brussels ruled the deal had moved, but not reduced, Berlinâs own liabilities to the postal pension fund. Germanyâs federal court of auditors was similarly critical, accusing Berlin of creative accounting to âpush liabilities into the futureâ. The juggling failed to reduce Berlinâs deficit, though the advising investment bankers still earned â¬83 million on the deal. Further Irish companies Despite this, Mr Eichelâs successor, Mr SteinbrÃ¼ck, continued the practice â covering the stateâs pension liabilities with securitised pension obligations. To save taxes on the transactions, Berlin set up further companies in Ireland, named German Postal Pensions Securitisation 1 and 2. With the securitisation income now paid up-front, Berlin now has to shoulder â alone â the remaining cost of 275,000 pensioners. Worse, the pension fund members were told that some â¬2.8 billion in income from the Irish-based companies was invested in special-purpose vehicles including those of Dexia , the failed Belgian-French bank nationalised in 2011 with â¬90 billion of public money. The SPDâs use of Irish firms to juggle pensions payments and save taxes could be an interesting point of discussion when TÃ¡naiste Eamon Gilmore visits Berlin this week. On Mr Gilmoreâs last visit to Berlin, in October last year, Mr SteinbrÃ¼ck used a public discussion forum to criticise Irelandâs tax rate. âIf Germany is making available its creditworthiness to others, we expect others to improve their own revenue base,â said Mr SteinbrÃ¼ck.

Search sites get closer to users Search sites get closer to users Search sites want to get to know you better. Not content with providing access to the millions of websites, many now offer ways that do a better job of remembering, cataloguing and managing all the information you come across. Some of the latest to update their search systems are Ask Jeeves and Blinkx, which have both released a series of utilities that try to help people get more from the web. "The future is all about developing your own personal web," said Tony Macklin, spokesman for Ask Jeeves. Mr Macklin said that too often when people use a search engine it was like the first time they ever used it, because there was no memory of what they had searched for before. "Each time you go back in you have to start all over again," he said. The series of updates to its service, collected under the My Ask Jeeves banner, would help people remember where they had been before. Ask Jeeves has added the ability to "save" websites of interest so the next time a users visits the site they can search through the sites they have previously found. Sites saved in this way can be arranged in folders and have notes attached to them to explain why they were saved. Mr Macklin said many people wanted to save sites they had seen but did not want to add them to their bookmarks or favourites not least because such lists cannot be easily searched. On average, said Mr Macklin, users conduct between five and 10 searches per day and the tools in My Ask Jeeves should stop them having to do searches twice and get to what they want much more easily. Under My Ask Jeeves users can search the web or through the results they have already noted as interesting. "It's about finding again what you found before," he said. The My Ask Jeeves service lets people store up to a 1000 web links or 5000 if they sign up to the free service. By way of comparison Google's Desktop search tool catalogues search histories informally and lets people look through the sites they have visited. At the same time, search start-up Blinkx has released a second version of its eponymous software. Blinkx is desktop search software that watches what someone is working on, be it a document or e-mail, and suggests websites, video clips, blogs or documents on a PC that are relevant to it. Since Blinkx launched it has faced increased competition from firms such as Google, Copernic, Enfish, X1 and Apple all of whom now have programs that let people search their PC as well as the web. "The competition has validated the problem we tackle," said Suranga Chandratillake, co-founder of Blinkx. In the latest release of Blinkx, the company has added what it calls smart folders. Once created the folders act as persistent queries that automatically sweep the web for pages related to their subject and catalogues relevant information, documents or incoming e-mails, on hard drives too. What users do with Blinkx and other desktop search engines shows that people tend to be very promiscuous in their use of search engines. "Blinkx users do not stop using other web search systems," he said. "They might use Google to look up a company, or Yahoo for travel because they know they are good at that," he said. "The classic thing we have seen recently, is people using Blinkx to look at the things they have searched on," he said. The variety of ways to search data was only helping users, said Mr Chandratillake and that it was likely that in the future people would use different ones for different tasks. Return to results
Security software firm Symantec is to establish a European customer support base alongside its exist... Security software firm Symantec is to establish a European customer support base alongside its existing facility in Blanchardstown which will create 400 new jobs. The company, which produces a range of content and network security software, said the new centre would provide a Europe-wide sales and support function to its customers. Some 200 of the jobs will be created immediately, while a further 200 positions will be created over the next two years, the company said. Symantec said it would be seeking highly skilled, multilingual staff to fill the roles. The companyâs Dublin base, which was established in 1991, employs just over 600 people and houses Symantecâs global security operations centre, as well as operations in business authentication, software development and testing. The companyâs new European customer management centre will be located alongside these existing functions, the company said today. The expansion is supported by the Department of Jobs, Enterprise, and Innovation through IDA Ireland . âSymantec is part of a thriving cluster of world leading security software companies operating in Ireland , â IDA Ireland chief executive Barry OâLeary said. Taoiseach Enda Kenny said: âSymantecâs establishment of its European Customer Management Centre in Dublin is a signal of its continuing commitment to Ireland and contribution to our economic recovery.â Minister for Jobs, Enterprise, and Innovation, Richard Bruton said: âThis announcement by Symantec, that it is to expand its operations and create 400 new high quality jobs, is a fantastic example of our ambition to grow the ICT sector which has already seen substantial employment growth since we took office.â Symantecâs Matthew Ellard said: âThese new jobs offer the opportunity for talented and driven individuals to join a high-performing company, which is focused on enabling its employees to develop their skills and enhance their career.â Latest Economy Comments are closed for this article.
Smith keen on Home series return Smith keen on Home series return Scotland manager Walter Smith has given his backing to the reinstatement of the Home International series. Such a plan is to be proposed by the new chief executive of the Northern Irish FA, Howard Wells, at the next meeting of the four home countries. The English FA has expressed doubt as to whether the fixtures could be accommodated at the end of each season. But Smith said: "Bringing it back would add meaning to friendly games and that's something that's needed." The Home International series was done away with in 1984, with the traditional Scotland-England fixture continuing until 1989. That game is one Smith would be delighted to see reinstated. "The Scotland v England match was a highlight of the end of the season," he added. "I was in Italy for their friendly with Russia last week and they made seven substitutions while only around 20,000 fans turned up to watch. "England were criticised for the 0-0 draw against Holland - the way Scotland were slammed in the past for poor results in friendlies. "You have to put a performance on in friendly games. If you don't, they can be de-motivating. "It can be a dangerous road to go down, if players don't apply themselves in the manner they should. "So I would support the return of the home internationals - the only problem would be fitting them in to the fixture schedule." Comments are closed for this article.
Sombre mood on Main St is not reflected on Wall St Sombre mood on Main St is not reflected on Wall St Charlie Fell William McChesney Martin, who served as chairman of the Federal Reserve for the best part of two decades from April 1951 to January 1970, told the New York Group of the Investment Bankers Association of America in the autumn of 1955 that a central bankâs decision to begin a cycle of tighter or less accommodative monetary policy put it âin the position of the chaperone who has ordered the punch bowl removed just when the party was really warming upâ. More than half a century later, Martinâs words seemed apt as, during the early-summer, various members of the Federal Open Market Committee signalled the central bankâs intention to take the first step on the long road back to monetary normalisation before the end of the year. Not surprisingly, the Fedâs forward guidance saw most market participants assume that a tapering of the Federal Reserveâs asset purchase programme was almost certain to be announced in September, and the resulting repositioning of portfolios contributed to a notable increase in financial market volatility through the summer months. Market expectations were frustrated however, as the Federal Reserve decided to keep the pace of quantitative easing unchanged and âawait more evidence that the recoveryâs progress will be sustainedâ. The central bankâs unexpected decision reflected the fact that hard economic data confirm there were few if any signs that âthe party was really warming upâ on Main Street, and fears that the increase in long-term interest rates which followed the Fedâs forward guidance earlier in the year might derail the tentative recovery. The sombre mood on Main Street stands in sharp contrast to the atmosphere on Wall Street, where the yields on credit market debt hover close to all-time lows, while stock prices remain within touching distance of record highs. Importantly, the Federal Reserveâs decision not to reduce the extraordinary level of monetary accommodation would appear to suggest that the central bank will not tolerate nominal yields on 10-year Treasury debt in excess of 3 per cent, which could lead to the propagation of dangerous asset bubbles as investors mistakenly believe they can safely move out the risk spectrum in their search for incremental returns. It is important to appreciate that quantitative easingâs positive impact on real economic activity and inflation stems primarily from the âportfolio balance effectâ. The large-scale asset purchases undertaken by a central bank as a result of quantitative easing will reduce the duration of private sector portfolios as the monetary authority exchanges a short-dated asset, bank deposits or freshly-created bank reserves, for a long-dated asset â Treasury bonds or mortgage-backed securities. Most investors are likely to use the proceeds of their asset sales to restore the duration of their portfolios and, since the central bankâs asset purchases reduces the quantity of long-dated assets and thus duration risk available to the private sector, investors are likely to require less compensation â lower prospective returns â to hold long-dated securities. In other words, term premiums and yields are likely to decline. .

Spain coach faces racism inquiry Spain coach faces racism inquiry Spain's Football Federation has initiated disciplinary action against national coach Luis Aragones over racist comments about Thierry Henry. If found guilty Aragones could lose his job or face a fine of about Â£22,000. The federation had initially declined to take action against Aragones after comments he made during a national team training session in October. But its president Angel Maria Villar changed his mind after a request by Spain's anti-violence commission. Aragones insisted the comments, made to Henry's Arsenal club-mate Jose Antonio Reyes, were meant to motivate the player, and were not intended to be offensive. "I never intended to offend anyone, and for that reason I have a very easy conscience," he said at the time. "I'm obliged to motivate my players to get the best results. "As part of that job, I use colloquial language, with which we can all understand each other within the framework of the football world. " England's players made a point of wearing anti-racism t-shirts when training before their friendly against Spain in Madrid last month. But the storm increased following racist chanting by Spanish fans at England's black players during the game, which Spain won 1-0. Spain's minister of sport Jaime Lissavetzky was quick to give his backing to the Federation's decision. "Everyone who has a public function has to consider their declarations, and make sure they do not give a negative image," he said. "We are going to have zero tolerance in questions of racism."

Supercomputer breaks speed record Supercomputer breaks speed record The US is poised to push Japan off the top of the supercomputing chart with IBM's prototype Blue Gene/L machine. It is being assembled for the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, a US Department of Energy (DOE) lab. DOE test results show that Blue Gene/L has managed speeds of 70.72 teraflops. The current top machine, Japan's NEC Earth Simulator, clocks up 35.86. Due next week, the Top 500 list officially charts the fastest computers in the world. It is announced every six months and is worked out using an officially recognised mathematical speed test called Linpack which measures calculations per second. The speeds will most likely make it the fastest computer system on the planet, yet the chip technology powering the machine is the kind which can be found in familiar devices such as games consoles. The US Secretary of Energy Spencer Abraham confirmed that the machine had reached the breakneck speed, according to the Linpack benchmark. Until the official list is published, however, Blue Gene/L's position will not be confirmed, and there are expected to be some other new entries. But the test results raise the bar of supercomputing enormously and signal a remarkable achievement. Surpassing the 40 trillion calculations per second (teraflop) mark has been considered a landmark for some time. The IBM Blue Gene/L is only a prototype and is one 5th the speed of the full version, due to be completed for the Livermore labs in 2005. Its peak theoretical performance is expected to be 360 teraflops, and will fit into 64 full racks. It will also cut down on the amount of heat generated by the massive power, a big problem for supercomputers. The final machine will help scientists work out the safety, security and reliability requirements for the US's nuclear weapons stockpile, without the need for underground nuclear testing. The Earth Simulator has held on to the top spot since June 2002. It is dedicated to climate modelling and simulating seismic activity. But in September, IBM said that another Blue Gene/L machine clocked up 36.01 teraflops, marginally surpassing the Earth Simulator's performance. This was achieved during internal testing at IBM's production facility in Rochester, Minnesota, though, so was not an official record. Another giant to enter the fray is Silicon Graphics' Columbia supercomputer based at Nasa's Ames Research Center in California. It would be used to model flight missions, climate research, and aerospace engineering. The Linux-based machine was reported to have reached a top speed of 42.7 teraflops in October. Supercomputers are hugely important for working out very complex problems across science and society. Their massive simulation and processing power means they can improve the accuracy of weather forecasts, help design better cars, and improve disease diagnosis. IBM's senior vice president of technology and manufacturing, Nick Donofrio, believes that by 2006, Blue Gene will be capable of petaflop computing. This means it would be capable of doing 1,000 trillion operations a second. "When you get a computer as large as a petaflop, you can start to think of simulations that might complement the physical world," Mr Donofrio recently told the Online News News website. "You can start to be more proactive, more interactive and more innovative." One area where Mr Donofrio sees supercomputing - and Blue Gene machines in particular - as crucial is health. He believes the machines can help scientists understand one of the greatest challenges of the 21st Century: protein folding. "Health is one of the most important problems, not just mapping the human genome, but also protein structures. "We are a great believer in simulation. It gives you another tool," he said. Once the structures of proteins are understood fully, then drugs can be tailor-made to fight diseases more effectively. Compared with the current fastest supercomputers, Blue Gene is designed to consume one 15th the power and be 10 times more compact. Since the first supercomputer, the Cray-1, was installed at Los Alamos National Laboratory in 1976, computational speed has leaped 500,000 times. The Cray-1 was capable of 80 megaflops (80 million operations a second). The Blue Gene/L machine that will be completed next year will be five million times faster. Started in 1993, the Top 500 list is decided by a group of computer science academics from around the world. It is presented at the International Supercomputer Conference in Pittsburgh.

Taoiseach stresses need to reduce deficit in address to business leaders Taoiseach stresses need to reduce deficit in address to business leaders Kenny says Governmentâs main objective is to fix public finances Dan Doctoroff, ceo and president of Online News, at the Convention Centre, Dublin where he addressed the Dublin Chamber of Commerce Annual Dinner, with Bernard Byrne of AIB, Liam Kavanagh, president of the Dublin Chamber of Commerce, and Gina Quinn, CEO of the Dublin Chamber of Commerce. Photograph: Brenda Fitzsimons Charlie Taylor Restoring Irelandâs reputation for prudent financial management is key to getting more investment and jobs into the country, Taoiseach Enda Kenny has said. Addressing more than 1,600 business leaders at the annual Dublin Chamber of Commerce dinner in the Convention Centre last night, Mr Kenny also said that while agreement has been reached to ensure that spending cuts and tax increases will be less than previously forecast, next weekâs Budget will still be difficult for many. Mr Kenny said the Governmentâs main objectives in the Budget is to continue the job of fixing the public finances in order to exit the bailout later this year and to invest in the creation of jobs. The Taoiseach said the Government remains committed to reducing the deficit to below 5 per cent next year and below 3 per cent by 2015. âThe gap between day-to- day Government spending and tax receipts is still one of the highest in the euro zone. It is also unsustainable,â he said. Mr Kenny used his speech to highlight the role that Dublin plays in driving the national economy. Claiming that the cityâs best days are still to come, he said much work has been done in recent years to transform the capital from âan underdeveloped resource to a modern, cosmopolitan and creative cityâ. âDublin has become a true international city. And as such Dublin is now competing for investment and jobs with competitor cities all over the world,â he said. The greatest way to commemorate Dublin in 1916 will be for our capital city, 100 years on in 2016, to be a vibrant, attractive, and successful city.â The chief executive and president of Online News Dan Doctoroff said Irelandâs decision to make difficult decisions and keep investing during recessionary times will help it to recover. Mr Doctoroff, who also served as deputy mayor for economic development and rebuilding of New York following the September 11th attacks in 2001, said constant investment, radical self-awareness and the ability to think big are key skills needed to rebuild economies. Praising the decisions taken over the past five years to bolster the economy, he said Ireland would emerge stronger than before. âThe challenge of thinking big is that it doesnât always show up in the next quarterly GDP report,â he said. âIn Ireland your determination to keep investing in the things that really matter has allowed you to become a place where Irish entrepreneurs are building and creating jobs and taking ideas to the world.â âBad tasteâ Director of personal, business and corporate banking at AIB Bernard Byrne told business leaders the excesses of the past, both within the banking industry and further afield, had âleft us with a bad taste and a strong desire for the opposite regime to prevail.â He added that the banking system was close to being back on track. âWhile the work is not completed, the significant restructuring of the industry that has seen â¬70 billion of loans delivered across the industry and massive shrinkage of headcount are more in the past than a future prospect,â he said. âThe signs of the return to profitability are strong and 2013 will prove to have been the watershed year where the debate about credit provisions is finally laid to rest with the pillar banks seeing 2014 as the year when profits exceed provisions for the first time. We are within touching distance of the self-financing viable banks that are so badly needed.â Grounds for optimism President of Dublin Chamber of Commerce Liam Kavanagh said there were grounds for optimism about the economy but that more needed to be done to get the country back on track. Calling for the retention of the 9 per cent Vat rate, he also stressed the need to retain the current corporation tax rate to attract foreign investment. Mr Kavanagh also stressed the need for a directly elected mayor for the capital. âDublin needs its own âpolitical championâ. The Chamber believes that Dublin should have a directly elected Mayor. But that office must have real executive power and authority to drive the promotion of enterprise, innovation, tourism and transport for the city,â he said. Return to results
Tax revenues up 2.9%, exchequer returns show Tax revenues up 2.9%, exchequer returns show Minister for Finance Michael Noonan and Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform Brendan Howlin at a press conference today outlining the third quarter exchequer returns. Photograph: Frank Miller / The Online News Minister for Finance Michael Noonan has said the budgetary adjustment will be âsomewhat lessâ than the â¬3.1 billion recommended by the troika. However, he said he would only reveal by how much on Budget day. âWe think we can do it somewhat less than the â¬3.1 billion, but we still have a lot of number crunching to do to see where we come in.â Mr Noonan was speaking as the exchequer returns for first nine months of the year showed tax revenues were exactly on target, while spending was running below expectations. The figures, which are expected to be central to the Cabinetâs budgetary deliberations, suggest the Government will realise its main fiscal targets for 2013. The exchequer deficit at the end of September now stands at â¬7.1 billion, some â¬4 billion lower than at the same stage last year. The figures showed that tax revenues were up 2.9 per cent (or â¬768 million) on last year. Income tax, the largest single source of revenue for the exchequer, raised â¬10.8 billion in the first nine months of the year. This was â¬81 million (or 0.7 per cent) below target. However, the department attributed the slight underperformance to weaker-than-expected receipts from the Deposit Interest Retention Tax (Dirt), linked to lower interest being earned on cash on deposit in banks. VAT receipts for the period totalled â¬8.4 billion, which represents a shortfall of â¬165 million (1.9 per cent) against target, reflecting weak retail sales. However, the department said VAT receipts had picked up substantially in July and August on account of the good weather and the new seasonal pattern of car sales. VAT receipts for September were â¬1.6 billion, which was â¬80 million or 5.2 per cent ahead of the departmentâs monthly target. The shortfall in income tax and VAT was largely offset by a better-than-expected performance in corporation tax, which came in â¬239 million (10 per cent) ahead of the â¬2.4 billion target for the nine-month period. Local Property Tax receipts also boosted Government coffers, netting the exchequer â¬ 200 million so far this year, which was â¬ 80 million or 66.6 per cent ahead of target. Net voted expenditure was 2.7 per cent below target, at â¬31.6 billion, at the end of the period, and 4.9 per cent down year-on-year. The Government is committed to ensuring Budget 2014 delivers a general government deficit of no greater than 5.1 per cent of GDP next year. âAs well as implementing the bailout programme, we have to politically manage it and grow the economy at the same time,â Mr Noonan said.

The European Union today proposed rule changes that would force companies to pay taxes on cross-bord... The European Union today proposed rule changes that would force companies to pay taxes on cross-border hybrid loan payments, so that firms donât use accounting loopholes to avoid taxation. EU Tax Commissioner Algirdas Semeta said changes to the EUâs parent-subsidiary directive would make sure companies pay tax in at least one country on hybrid-loan payments. The EU also wants countries to adopt a âcommon anti-abuse ruleâ to discourage aggressive tax planning. Hybrid-loan arrangements are financial instruments that have both debt and equity characteristics and can be used to minimize or avoid taxes, the European Commission said. European laws currently allow subsidiaries in some countries to take tax deductions on loan payments to their parent companies, and EU law lets parent companies avoid taxes on dividends that they receive from their subsidiaries. Todayâs plan would require companies to pay taxes on an incoming payment if it has been deducted elsewhere as a debt repayment, the EU said. âThese businesses need to make their fair contribution to public finances,â Semeta said in a statement. âWe can no longer afford freeloaders who reap huge profits in the EU without contributing to the public purse.â Semeta also said he will travel to Australia this week to discuss that countryâs upcoming presidency of the Group of 20 nations.

The Irish business community in Asia gathered last week in the Park Royal Hotel in the Malaysian cap... The Irish business community in Asia gathered last week in the Park Royal Hotel in the Malaysian capital Kuala Lumpur for the Asia Pacific Irish Business Forum, an annual gathering to promote Ireland in the worldâs most populous continent. Up to 400 attendees from across the Gulf and Asia Pacific gathered for the meeting, the seventh such gathering. âItâs a wonderful network,â said Paraic McGrath, director of ESB International and a co-founder of the APIBF. âWeâll probably revamp it next year, to freshen it up and get more people from Ireland coming out. We also hope to get more people from the chambers in the region involved.â Established in 2007, the APIBF takes place in tandem with the Asian GAA Games , and aims to leverage the GAA network in Asia by using the fact that so many Irish are visiting the city for the games. âIt was a great opportunity for the businesses that travelled with us from Ireland to meet successful Irish businesses in the region like Steripack and Openet and to learn from their experience,â said Ashley Beston of the Irish Exporters Association, which brought a number of companies to the event. GAA star Dublin GAA star Bernard Brogan was also at the event to promote his recently established sports management and professional services company Legacy and to meet Irish businesses in Asia. âThe GAA offers a new parish for Irish people and a link to home â there is a great opportunity to build on this event promoting Brand Ireland in Asia,â said Brogan. This was the second year the meeting has been hosted in Kuala Lumpur, and the meeting has been hosted successively in Penang (2008), Bangkok in 2009, Hong Kong in 2010 and Seoul in 2011.

Three in five teens eat fast food every week Three in five teens eat fast food every week Survey shows teeenage boys consume more junk food, soft drinks than girls Irish teenagers crave junk food but donât feel they are eating badly or are overweight, according to a new survey. Irish teenagers crave junk food but donât feel they are eating badly or are overweight, according to a new survey. Three in five young people eat fast food at least weekly and almost one-third say they eat âa lotâ of junk food, the survey of 500 teenagers shows. One in three teenagers have soft drinks at least daily while only half eat the recommended five servings of fruit and vegetables each day. Boys were slightly more likely than girls to consume junk food and soft drinks but they were more active physically. Three-quarters of boys take part in team sports compared to half of girls, while 46 per cent of boys take daily physical exercise, against 39 per cent of girls. For many girls, their physical exercise is confined to walking, with only hockey, camogie, GAA and basketball being participated in by girls to any great extent. Virtually all teenagers say they are happy and feel great mentally, with 88 per cent saying they feel great physically. When asked whether they would prefer to look good or feel healthy, 16 per cent opted for looking good. Some 14 per cent of teenagers said they were concerned about their heart health. The survey was released to coincide with the second year of the Pumped Schoolsâ Video Awards by Leinster rugby player Fergus McFadden and Olympic pentathlete Natalya Coyle . Mr McFadden said it was important to get the message out to young people about the need to look closely at what they are eating and how much exercise they are taking.

US export prices fall in sign of poor global economy US export prices fall in sign of poor global economy Export prices dropped 0.5 per cent last month, the seventh decline in eight months The decline in US export prices suggests that consumers in crisis-stricken Europe and other major trading partners are struggling so much that American producers have little leverage to raise prices. Photograph: Scott Eells/Online News Prices for US exports unexpectedly fell in October, a worrisome sign of global economic weakness, while the cost of imports into America declined due to a sharp drop in the price of oil. Export prices dropped 0.5 per cent last month, the seventh decline in eight months, the Labor Department said today. Analysts polled by Online News had expected a slight increase in export prices. The decline suggests that consumers in crisis-stricken Europe and other major trading partners are struggling so much that American producers have little leverage to raise prices. The European Central Bank , which is struggling to support a recovery, cut interest rates earlier this month in part over concerns the regionâs weak economy is weighing too much on prices. The Labor Departmentâs report also showed that prices for US imports fell 0.7 per cent in October, which was a sharper decline than expected. A 3.6 per cent fall in petroleum imports, which was the sharpest decline in over a year, drove the drop in overall prices. However, there were signs that weakness abroad was also fueling price declines. Prices for imports from Japan dropped 0.2 percent last month, a possible sign that Japanâs extremely accommodative monetary policy was putting downward pressure on its exchange rate and making its exports more competitive abroad. In a possible sign of Japanese competitiveness, prices for auto imports fell 0.1 percent and were down 1.4 per cent in the year through October. The 12-month decline is the biggest drop since the Labor Department began tracking it in 1981. (Online News) Comments are closed for this article.
Unemployment rate falls to 12.8%, lowest since 2009 Unemployment rate falls to 12.8%, lowest since 2009 CSO says numbers out of work fell by 41,700 in the year to the end of September Unemployment fell by 12.8 per cent or 41,700 in the year to September. A graphic showing the change in unemployment in the Republic between 1998 and the third quarter of 2013. Graphic: Online News studio Previous Image Next Image The Government has claimed a turnaround in the rate of unemployment is evidence of the strengthening Irish economy. Figures released by the Central Statistics Office today show that The numbers unemployed fell by 41,700 in the year to the end of September, reducing the total number of people out of work to 282,900. As a result the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate decreased from 13.6 per cent to 12.8 per cent over the July to September quarter while the number of people unemployed fell by 18,000. This is the fifth quarter in succession where unemployment has declined on an annual basis and has led to the lowest rate of unemployment since 2009. Taoiseach Enda Kenny said over 1,000 new jobs were being created per week in the economy and there were âpositive signs that business confidence is risingâ There was an annual increase in employment of 3.2 per cent or 58,000 in the year to the end of September, bringing total employment to 1,899,300. This compares with an annual increase in employment of 1.8 per cent in the previous quarter. On a seasonally adjusted basis there were 22,500 more jobs in the economy in the July-September period. The figures also show a decline in long term unemployment from 8.9 per cent to 7.6 per cent over the year. âMore than 1,000 people a week are returning to work, proof that the measures taken by the Government to stabilise the economy and address the unemployment crisis which we inherited are paying off,â Minister for Social Protection Joan Burton said. The latest figures follow separate data published by the CSO showing that the Live Register in October fell below 400,000 for the first time in four years. Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation Richard Bruton took to Twitter to welcome the increasing employment figures. âPrivate sector adding 1,200 jobs a week. Very encouraging. Testament to Irish workforce and entrepreneurial spirit. Real base to build on,â he said. Tanaiste Eamon Gilmore highlighted the decline in the long-term unemployment rate which he said had fallen from 8.9 per cent to 7.6 per cent over the past year. However, the amount of people classed as long-term unemployed - out of work for a year or more - accounts for 58 per cent of the total - only down about 1 per cent from a year earlier. The total number of people in the labour force is 2,182,100 - up 16,300 over the year. Minister for Social Protection Joan Burton said: âThere are still far too many people out of work, and tackling unemployment will remain the Governmentâs number one priority, but these figures demonstrate that we are making steady progressâ. .

Virgin Radio offers 3G broadcast Virgin Radio offers 3G broadcast UK broadcaster Virgin Radio says it will become the first station in the world to offer radio via 3G mobiles. The radio station, in partnership with technology firm Sydus, will broadcast on selected 2G and high-speed 3G networks. Later this year listeners will be able to download software from the Virgin website which enables the service. James Cridland, head of new media at Virgin Radio, said: "It places radio at the heart of the 3G revolution." Virgin Radio will be the first station made available followed by two digital stations, Virgin Radio Classic Rock and Virgin Radio Groove. Mr Cridland said: "This application will enable anyone, anywhere to listen to Virgin Radio simply with the phone in their pocket. "This allows us to tap into a huge new audience and keep radio relevant for a new generation of listeners." Saumil Nanavati, president of Sydus, said, "This radio player is what the 3G network was built for, giving consumers high-quality and high-data products through a handset in their pocket." Virgin says an hour's listening to the station via mobile would involve about 7.2MB of data, which could prove expensive for people using pay as you download GPRS or 3G services. Some networks, such as Orange, charge up to Â£1 for every one megabyte of data downloaded. Virgin says radio via 2G or 3G mobiles is therefore going to appeal to people with unlimited download deals. There are 30 compatible handsets available from major manufacturers including Nokia and Samsung while Virgin said more than 14.9 million consumers across the globe can use the service currently.

Weidmann tells Germans to stop complaining Weidmann tells Germans to stop complaining Jens Weidmann: the president of the Bundesbank played down his interest rate row with ECB president Mario Draghi Bundesbank president Jens Weidmann has told his fellow Germans to stop complaining about low interest rates on their savings â now even lower after the last ECB rate cut. Mr Weidmann opposed last weekâs cut, preferring to postpone a final decision until December, but he told Die Zeit yesterday the negative reaction in the German media was overblown and shortsighted. The Bundesbank chief played down his interest rate row with ECB president Mario Draghi , saying it was âgood that we struggleâ over monetary policy decisions. But he had unusually strong words for his fellow Germans and their allergic reaction, amplified by the domestic media, that the interest rate cut punished savers. âEveryone who wants to invest their money safely feels the low interest rate, that applies as much to an Italian saver as a Germany , â said Mr Weidmann. âThe saver has to be able to count on interest rates being increased at the right time if the inflation risks increase.â The ECBâs mandate, he added, was to preserve the euroâs price stability ânot to guarantee yieldsâ. âItâs important to remember that weâre not just savers. We are also employees, perhaps we want to buy a property, we are taxpayers,â he added. âIn these roles we profit from the low interest rates because perhaps they secure our job, make it cheaper to take out a mortgage and reduce the burden on the state budget.â The ECB reduced its main refinancing rate by a quarter of a percentage point to 0.25 per cent on November 7th.Inflation in the euro area slowed to its lowest level in four years last month at just 0.7 per cent, less than half the ECBâs stated target of at or just below 2 per cent.

Wenger signs new deal Wenger signs new deal Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger has signed a new contract to stay at the club until May 2008. Wenger has ended speculation about his future by agreeing a long-term contract that takes him beyond the opening of Arsenal's new stadium in two years. He said: "Signing a new contract just rubber-stamps my desire to take this club forward and fulfil my ambitions. "I still have so much to achieve and my target is to drive this club on. These are exciting times for Arsenal." The 55-year-old Frenchman told Arsenal's website www.arsenal.com: "My intention has always been clear. I love this club and am very happy here." Wenger has won the title and the FA Cup three times each during his reign. Chairman Peter Hill-Wood said: "We are absolutely delighted that Arsene has signed an extension to his contract. "Since his arrival in 1996, he has revolutionised the club both on and off the pitch. "As well as the six major honours he's won during his time here, Arsene has been a leading influence behind all the major initiatives at the club including the construction of our new training centre and also our new stadium. "The club has continued to reap the benefits of Arsene's natural eye for unearthing footballing talent. "We currently have a fantastic crop of young players coming through the ranks together with a number of world-class players who are playing a wonderful brand of football." Meanwhile, Arsenal director Danny Fiszman is looking for Wenger to stay beyond 2008. "When we come towards the end of his contract we will both review the situation. I'm sure we will want him to stay on and I hope he will too," said Fiszman. Comments are closed for this article.
Why long-term recession might be the new normal Why long-term recession might be the new normal What if depression-like conditions are on track to persist, not for another year or two, but for decades? A trader on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange yesterday. âThe case for âsecular stagnationâ â a persistent state in which a depressed economy is the norm, with episodes of full employment few and far between â was made forcefully recently at the most ultra-respectable of venues, the IMFâs big annual research conference.â Photograph: Andrew Burton/Getty Images Spend any time around monetary officials and one word youâll hear a lot is ânormalisationâ. Most though not all such officials accept that now is no time to be tight-fisted, that for the time being credit must be easy and interest rates low. Still, the men in dark suits look forward eagerly to the day when they can go back to their usual job, snatching away the punch bowl whenever the party gets going. But what if the world in which we have been living in for the past five years is the new normal? What if depression-like conditions are on track to persist, not for another year or two, but for decades? You might imagine that speculations along these lines are the province of a radical fringe. They are indeed radical â but fringe, not so much. A number of economists have been flirting with such thoughts for a while. And now theyâve moved into the mainstream. In fact, the case for âsecular stagnationâ â a persistent state in which a depressed economy is the norm, with episodes of full employment few and far between â was made forcefully recently at the most ultra-respectable of venues, the IMFâs big annual research conference. And the person making that case was none other than Larry Summers. Yes, that Larry Summers. Summers began with a point that should be obvious but is often missed: the financial crisis that started the Great Recession is now far behind us. Indeed, by most measures it ended more than four years ago. Yet our economy remains depressed. He then made a related point: Before the crisis we had a huge housing and debt bubble. Yet even with this huge bubble boosting spending, the overall economy was only so-so â the job market was okay but not great, and the boom was never powerful enough to produce significant inflationary pressure. Summers went on to draw a remarkable moral: We have, he suggested, an economy whose normal condition is one of inadequate demand â of at least mild depression â and which only gets anywhere close to full employment when it is being buoyed by bubbles. Bubbles Iâd weigh in with some further evidence. Look at household debt relative to income. That ratio was roughly stable from 1960 to 1985, but rose rapidly and inexorably from 1985 to 2007, when crisis struck. Yet even with households going ever deeper into debt, the economyâs performance over the period as a whole was mediocre at best, and demand showed no sign of running ahead of supply. Looking forward, we obviously canât go back to the days of ever- rising debt. Yet that means weaker consumer demand â and without that demand, how are we supposed to return to full employment? Again, the evidence suggests that we have become an economy whose normal state is one of mild depression, whose brief episodes of prosperity occur only thanks to bubbles and unsustainable borrowing. Why might this be happening? One answer could be slowing population growth. A growing population creates a demand for new houses, new office buildings, and so on; when growth slows, that demand drops off. Americaâs working-age population rose rapidly in the 1960s and 1970s, as baby boomers grew up, and its workforce rose even faster, as women moved into the labour market. Thatâs now all behind us. And you can see the effects: even at the height of the housing bubble, we werenât building nearly as many houses as in the 1970s. Another important factor may be persistent trade deficits, which emerged in the 1980s and since then have fluctuated but never gone away. Easy money should, and probably will, be with us for a very long time. This, in turn, means we can forget all those scare stories about government debt, which run along the lines of âIt may not be a problem now, but just wait until interest rates rise.â More broadly, if our economy has a persistent tendency toward depression, weâre going to be living under the looking-glass rules of depression economics â in which virtue is vice and prudence is folly, in which attempts to save more (including attempts to reduce budget deficits) make everyone worse off â for a long time. I know that many people just hate this kind of talk. It offends their sense of rightness, indeed their sense of morality. Economics is supposed to be about making hard choices (at the expense of others, naturally). Itâs not supposed to be about persuading people to spend more. But as Summers said, the crisis âis not over until it is overâ and economic reality is what it is. And what that reality appears to be right now is one in which depression rules will apply for a very long time. .

A&E at St Columcilleâs hospital in Loughlinstown to close at end of month A&E at St Columcilleâs hospital in Loughlinstown to close at end of month Closure seen as inevitable since concerns raised by Hiqa several years ago St Columcilleâs, Loughlinstown The emergency department at St Columcilleâs hospital in Loughlinstown is to close at the end of the month, the HSE has confirmed. From next month, a local injuries unit will operate at the hospital seven days a week from 8am to 6pm. It will treat minor injuries such as broken bones and burns, while emergency cases will be sent to St Vincentâs hospital. A medical assessment unit will also operate for long-term conditions such as asthma and diabetes. Staff and patients are being informed this week of the closure of the emergency department as part of a change of the hospital to level 2 status. A HSE spokeswoman said work on the reconfiguration of clinical services had been ongoing to bring service provision in line with best practice as outlined in the national clinical care programmes. âUtterly unacceptableâ She said more than 80 per cent of patients currently attending the hospital would continue to receive treatment in the local injuries unit, the medical assessment unit or by direct admission to the medical ward. Overall, patient attendances would rise, with a planned increase in day surgery and outpatient services. The closure of the emergency department has been seen as inevitable since concerns were raised by Hiqa several years ago about safety issues at a number of smaller hospitals, including Loughlinstown. People before Profit TD Richard Boyd Barrett said it was utterly unacceptable to shut down the 24-hour emergency service at Loughlinstown. âIf there is a serious accident on the N11, the extra distance to St Vincentâs could mean the difference between life and death,âhe added.

Agency responded to criticism from Ms Justice Mary Irvine Agency responded to criticism from Ms Justice Mary Irvine A spokesman for the agency was responding to queries from The Online News after Ms Justice Mary Irvine said the case of the family of Dhara Kivlehan against the HSE was the third in a week whereby the HSE had admitted liability â but had âheld out almost to the bitter endâ. Colin Gleeson The State Claims Agency has said long delays in relation to admissions of liability are due to the nature of assessing âexpert medical evidenceâ in relation to cases. A spokesman for the agency was responding to queries from The Online News after Ms Justice Mary Irvine said the case of the family of Dhara Kivlehan against the HSE was the third in a week whereby the HSE had admitted liability â but had âheld out almost to the bitter endâ. He said he did not wish to comment on any of the specific cases âother than to note that Judge Irvine said in court this afternoon that she would withdraw any criticism that she had made earlier today regarding the late concession of liability in the case Michael Kivlehan versus the HSEâ. âThe policy of admitting liability in medical negligence cases is to admit liability when the expert medical evidence indicates that there has been a breach of duty in any particular case. âThe commissioning of such expert medical evidence may take considerable time and may involve commissioning multiple reports from experts in different specialties, having regard to the complexity of individual cases.â He added that the High Court medical negligence working group, on which the agency is represented, has produced two recent reports âadvocating changes to the rules of superior courts and the adoption of pre-action protocols with the specific aim to significantly reduce the period of time to resolve medical negligence casesâ.

Announcement follows creation of â¬125m investment fund for medium-sized business Announcement follows creation of â¬125m investment fund for medium-sized business Rory Brooks , founder partner MML Capital , and Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation Richard Bruton , at the launch of a fund of â¬125 million, managed by MML Growth Capital Partners Ireland. Thirty start-up companies will create 218 jobs over the next 12 months, Taoiseach Enda Kenny is expected to announce tonight. Details of the jobs at companies backed by the Dublin Business Innovation Centre will emerge at a function to mark the centreâs 25th anniversary. The new jobs will be created across a range of some 30 entrepreneurial firms, including Davra Networks, EmpowerTheUser, iCabbi, Learnosity, MMSOFT Design, OpenJaw Technologies, Point of Care, Stratus5 and SafeFood 360. They come a day after Enterprise Ireland agreed to stump up a quarter of the equity for a new â¬125 million investment fund for more established, medium-sized businesses. The rest of the cash will be provided by AIB, which has committed â¬20 million, and three foreign investors. Action plan The initiative, which forms part of the Governmentâs Action Plan for Jobs, was launched yesterday by Minister for Jobs Richard Bruton , and Julie Sinnamon , chief executive of Enterprise Ireland. Executives from London-headquartered MML Capital partners, which will manage the fund, were also at the announcement. In addition to the cash committed by AIB and Enterprise Ireland, â¬80 million will be invested by the EU-backed European Investment Fund, GoldPoint Partners, which is owned by New York Life Insurance , and US healthcare investor Cigna . Irish businesses The fund will invest between â¬2 million and â¬12 million in growth-oriented, medium-sized Irish businesses. Richard Brooks , a founding partner of MML, said yesterday the fund would be âsector agnosticâ, although he indicated it would not invest in retail, property or start-up companies. It also will not buy distressed loans or assets. Mr Brooks said the money would be used to take majority and minority stakes â mostly in exporting companies â to fund organic growth, acquisitions, debt restructurings and shareholder restructurings. Mr Bruton said the State would adopt a âhands offâ approach to the fund, although MML said yesterday it still expected to work closely with Enterprise Ireland. MML, which is 25 years old this week, operates similar funds in central and eastern Europe and has previously worked with the EIF, GoldPoint and Gigna. MML also has operations in the US, London and Paris. Latest Economy Comments are closed for this article.
Arsenal through on penalties Arsenal through on penalties Arsenal win 4-2 on penalties The Spanish goalkeeper saved from Alan Quinn and Jon Harley as Arsenal sealed a quarter-final trip to Bolton with a 4-2 victory on penalties. Lauren, Patrick Vieira, Freddie Ljungberg and Ashley Cole scored for Arsenal, while Andy Gray and Phil Jagielka were on target for the Blades. Michael Tonge and Harley wasted chances for the underdogs, but Paddy Kenny was inspired to keep Arsenal at bay. Arsenal, stripped of attacking talent such as Thierry Henry and Dennis Bergkamp, partnered 17-year-old Italian striker Arturo Lupoli with Ljungberg up front. It was a revamped Arsenal line-up, and they were almost a goal behind within seconds as Tonge wasted a glorious chance. Gray ran free down the right flank, and his cross left Tonge with the simplest of chances, but he blazed over the top from six yards. Arsenal were barely seen as an attacking force in the opening 45 minutes, although Ljungberg turned a half-chance wide after good work by Cesc Fabregas. Arsene Wenger introduced Quincy Owusu-Abeyie for the ineffective Lupoli at half-time, and the pacy Dutch youngster had an immediate impact. He ran clear after good work by Mathieu Flamini, but his finish was tame and Kenny saved easily. Owusu-Abeyie then fired in a testing cross, which was met by Fabregas, and it needed a desperate clearance by Kenny's legs to save the Blades. Arsenal were now totally dominant, and were desperately unlucky not to take the lead after 62 minutes when Fabregas crashed a rising drive against the bar from 20 yards. It then took a brilliant tackle by Jagielka to deny Ljungberg as he was poised to strike. Arsenal continued to press, and once again Kenny was called into action with eight minutes left, diving low to clutch another close-range effort from Fabregas. Neil Warnock's side almost snatched victory in the dying seconds when Derek Geary's cross found Harley at the far post, but his diving header was brilliantly turned over by Almunia. Owusu-Abeyie's pace was causing all sorts of problems for the Blades, and as extra-time began, another surging run into the penalty area almost set up a chance for Ljungberg. Pascal Cygan missed Arsenal's best chance after 106 minutes, blazing across the face of goal when he was unmarked at the far post. Arsenal sent on Jeremie Aliadiere with seven minutes of extra-time left, and he almost broke the deadlock with his first touch. Kolo Toure's misplaced free-kick landed at his feet, but Kenny once again blocked from a tight angle. Arsenal laid siege to Sheffield United's goal in the dying minutes, but they somehow held on to force penalties. Almunia was then Arsenal's hero as another brave Blades cup campaign came to a losing end. Kenny, Geary, Morgan, Bromby, Harley, Liddell, Montgomery, Jagielka, Thirlwell, Tonge (Quinn 97), Gray.

Augmentin is prescribed for chest infections, including bronchitis and pneumonia Augmentin is prescribed for chest infections, including bronchitis and pneumonia Augmentin is prescribed for chest infections, including bronchitis and pneumonia. There will be a shortage of the widely used antibiotic Augmentin in Ireland from next month, according to the Department of Health . The department said a shortage of the lower strength 375mg tablet was expected in a couple of weeks. A shortage of the higher strength 625mg tablet is being forecast from January. Augmentin is prescribed for chest infections, including bronchitis and pneumonia. The HSE said that while there appeared to be a supply issue in relation to Augmentin and similar generics, it did not see this as something which should be a cause of concern amongst patients. In response to a DÃ¡il question , Minister of State at the Department of Health Alex White said the shortages were due to a combination of manufacturing problems at two UK sites of manufacturer GlaxosmithKline, coupled with an increase in demand. Mr White said he expected the shortage to last until at least September next year. The Minister said the HSE and the Irish Medicines Board were trying to identify alternative sources of supply, including from the manufacturer of a generic version of the product. He said the HSE was also working with doctors to develop prescribing guidelines for alternative treatment regimes if Augmentin is not available. Mr White said the issue would evolve over the coming months and said it was extremely important all stakeholders work together âto ensure that there is no panic buying which would accelerate the problemâ. In a statement, the HSE confirmed it had received notification from GlaxoSmithKline of âan international long-term problem with availability of co-amoxiclav (Augmentin) 250mg/125mg (375mg) tabs and 500mg/125mg (625mg) tabsâ. It said it was working with the Department of Health, the Irish Medicines Board and the Irish College of General Practitioners. âWhile there appears to be a supply issue in relation to Augmentin and similar generics we do not see this as something which should be a cause of concern amongst patients,â the executive said in a statement. âThe IMB has been engaging with Irish manufacturers of co-amoxiclav to see if products manufactured for other markets can be made available on the Irish market or indeed if products manufactured outside of Ireland could also be made available for the Irish market.â The HSE said that although co -amoxiclav was a commonly prescribed antimicrobial in primary care, it was ârarely recommended as the first choice antibioticâ. âThere are a range of alternative and less expensive forms of antibiotic used which are more appropriate as the first line of defense in situations where Augmentin is prescribed.â It said this was also an opportunity to emphasise to prescribers that antiobiotics may not be an appropriate treatment, depending on the infection - for example in the case of viral infections. Based on current stock, the Irish market can be supplied with Augmentin 625mg tablets until the end of November, and with 375mg tablets until the end of January. .

Autumn statement outlines plan to use lower borrowing to reduce debt Autumn statement outlines plan to use lower borrowing to reduce debt Britainâs chancellor of the exchequer George Osborne and chief secretary to the treasury Danny Alexander leave for the House of Commons ahead of the dilivery of the annual autumn financial statement. George Osborne has forecast that Britain will run a budget surplus by 2018 for the first time since the millennium as he declared in his autumn statement that âBritainâs economic plan is workingâ. However the UK chancellor also promised more âdifficult decisionsâ to repair the public finances. Shadow chancellor Ed Balls responded by claiming the government had taken on more debt in the past three years than Labour did during its previous 13 years in power and that a tiny minority was experiencing the recovery. In stark contrast to his budget in March â which came just after the weak economy was stripped of its triple-A credit rating â Mr Osborne unveiled the biggest upgrade to official growth forecasts since the millennium. The office for budget responsibility has raised its growth forecast for this year from 0.6 per cent to 1.4 per cent, and for next year from 1.8 per cent to 2.4 per cent. It also revised the following three years a touch lower, to 2.2 per cent, 2.6 per cent and 2.7 per cent in 2017. Unemployment drop The office now expects unemployment to fall to 7 per cent in 2015. In March it did not expect this to happen until 2017. The Bank of England has said it will not think about raising interest rates until this threshold is reached. Britainâs unexpectedly strong recovery over the past six months has also filtered through into much better forecasts for the public finances. The government will borrow Â£111 billion (â¬133 billion) this year according to the office for budget responsibility, down from the Â£120 billion forecast in March, and will run a small cash surplus in 2018-19 after almost a decade of austerity. The forecast for the structural deficit is little changed since March, however, because the office for budget responsibility has deemed the latest upgrades to be the result of a cyclical upswing. Mr Osborne is also failing to meet his fiscal rule to see the burden of public debt start to fall in 2015-16. Lower borrowing The economic judgment he has made is to use lower borrowing to reduce debt rather than to offer tax cuts or spending increases. To pay for some of the measures in the autumn statement, the chancellor cut government spending by Â£1 billion this year and in the following two years. Mr Osborne had already trailed many of yesterday policy announcements, including free school meals for all infants, more generous income tax allowances for some married couples and limits on energy bill rises. He has also announced a higher state pension age for young people. He said working pensioners would be allowed to make voluntary national insurance contributions and in return would receive a higher state pension. Mr Osborne confirmed that rises in the state pension age would come forward to 68 in the mid-2030s and 69 in the mid 2040s. He also unveiled a new set of tax avoidance measures, which he said would raise Â£9 billion over the next five years. Housing On the housing market, he said that from April 2015, foreigners who sell residential property in the UK would have to pay capital gains tax. Jobless young people who have left school at 16 without many qualifications will have to take training courses if they want to keep benefits. He promised to remove employersâ national insurance contributions for young people under 21 from April 2015. Mr Osborne also abolished stamp duty for shares traded on exchange traded funds. Mr Balls said the government had no right to be pleased with its performance because it was rewriting economic history. âYou used to say that you would balance the books in 2015, now you want us to congratulate you for saying you will do it in 2019,â he said in his Commons speech. â Return to results
Barwick calls for Highbury calm Barwick calls for Highbury calm New Football Association chief Brian Barwick pleaded with Arsenal and Manchester United to show calm ahead of their Highbury showdown. "When these two great teams meet it should represent all that is good about our domestic game," said Barwick, who started at the FA on Monday. "It shouldn't be the subject of recrimination and revenge for weeks and months following. "That doesn't set the right example for the rest of the game." Barwick also underlined his determination to clamp down on diving - or "cheating" as he unequivocally called it - in his bid to clean up the game. He said: " "There are always issues in the game and there always will be. "One that concerns me personally is technically termed 'simulation', but let's get real - this is diving. Cheating, in fact. "We've all got to show more honesty here. Every week, referees are coming under intense scrutiny when making split-second judgement calls in this area. "It's impossible to get them all right and everyone has got to take a greater level of responsibility." Barwick is determined to get more respect for referees at all levels of the game. He said: "I've always been impressed at the way in which the player-referee relationship in rugby union is based on mutual respect. "I want to see this type of relationship at every level of football, from the Premier League to the Sunday League." Return to results
Bates seals takeover Bates seals takeover Ken Bates has completed his takeover of Leeds United. The 73-year-old former Chelsea chairman sealed the deal at 0227 GMT on Friday, and has bought a 50% stake in the club. He said: "I'm delighted to be stepping up to the mantel at such a fantastic club. I recognise Leeds as a great club that has fallen on hard times. "We have a lot of hard work ahead to get the club back where it belongs in the Premiership, and with the help of our fans we will do everything we can." Bates bought his stake under the guise of a Geneva-based company known as The Forward Sports Fund. He revealed that part of his plan is to buy back Leeds' Elland Road stadium and Thorp Arch training ground in due course. "It's going to be a tough jon and the first task is to stabilise the cash flow and sort out the remaining creditors," Bates added. "But there is light at the end of a very long tunnel. For the past year it has been a matter of firefighting - now we can start running the club again." Outgoing Leeds chairman Gerald Krasner said: "This deal ensures the medium to long term survival of the club and I believe Mr Bates' proposals are totally for the benefit of the club. "We are content that under Mr Bates, Leeds United will continue to consolidate and move forward. "When we took over Leeds United in March 2004, the club had a debt of Â£103m, since that date, my board has succeeded in reducing the debt to under Â£25m. "We worked tirelessly to solve all of the problems at Leeds United. "Eighty percent of the problems have already been overcome and we came to this agreement with Mr Bates to secure its ongoing success." Krasner revealed that his consortium has been asked to remain in the background at the club for an undisclosed period to help ensure a smooth hand-over. He will stay on in an unpaid capacity while Peter Lorimer will continue in his role as director and point of contact for the fans and Peter McCormick will serve as a consultant to the incoming board. The other outgoing directors have agreed to leave their loans of Â£4.5m in the company for the next four years. On Leeds' new-look board it is understood that Lorimer will be joined by former Chelsea finance director Yvonne Todd and Bates' lawyer Mark Taylor. Krasner refused to give any details of the finances involved in the takeover. He told Online News Five Live: "I am not going into the figures. If Ken wants to give them up that is up to him. I can not tell you what the money will be used for. "This dea l is not about money for the current board. In the last four months I never saw any cheques until this week from one person. I am not stretching figures, we don't discuss internal arrangements." Bates stepped down as Chelsea chairman in March last year following Roman Abramovich's Â£140m takeover at Stamford Bridge. In May, he made a proposal to invest Â£10m in Sheffield Wednesday, but this was rejected by the club. Sebastien Sainsbury had been close to a takeover of Leeds but withdrew his Â£25m offer last week. His efforts failed after he revealed it would take Â£40m to stage a takeover, and that the club will also lose Â£10m over the next six months. The club was on the brink of administration - and the deduction of 10 points by the Football League - before Bates' arrival but his investment has spared them that prospect.

Blog reading explodes in America Blog reading explodes in America Americans are becoming avid blog readers, with 32 million getting hooked in 2004, according to new research. The survey, conducted by the Pew Internet and American Life Project, showed that blog readership has shot up by 58% in the last year. Some of this growth is attributable to political blogs written and read during the US presidential campaign. Despite the explosive growth, more than 60% of online Americans have still never heard of blogs, the survey found. Blogs, or web logs, are online spaces in which people can publish their thoughts, opinions or spread news events in their own words. Companies such as Google and Microsoft provide users with the tools to publish their own blogs. The rise of blogs has spawned a new desire for immediate news and information, with six million Americans now using RSS aggregators. RSS aggregators are downloaded to PCs and are programmed to subscribe to feeds from blogs, news sites and other websites. The aggregators automatically compile the latest information published online from the blogs or news sites. Reading blogs remains far more popular than writing them, the survey found. Only 7% of the 120 million US adults who use the internet had created a blog or web-based diary. Getting involved is becoming more popular though, with 12% saying they had posted material or comments on other people's blogs. Just under one in 10 of the US's internet users read political blogs such as the Daily Kos or Instapundit during the US presidential campaign. Kerry voters were slightly more likely to read them than Bush voters. Blog creators were likely to be young, well-educated, net-savvy males with good incomes and college educations, the survey found. This was also true of the average blog reader, although the survey found there was a greater than average growth in blog readership among women and those in minorities. The survey was conducted during November and involved telephone surveys of 1,324 internet users. Return to results
Board member hopes controversy around top-up payments will not impact on fundraising Board member hopes controversy around top-up payments will not impact on fundraising The audit found that Our Ladyâs Hospital, Crumlin, was one of 13 agencies collectively paying about â¬900,000 to senior managers in top-up payments and benefits from non-State sources. A board member of the Stateâs largest childrenâs hospital, Our Ladyâs in Crumlin, has said the Health Service Executive salary scale for chief executives is not appropriate and needs to be changed. Cllr Ruairi McGinley, who sits on the board of Our Ladyâs Childrenâs Hospital and St Jamesâs Hospital Dublin, also said he would be dismayed if the controversy around top-up payments for senior executives impacted on fundraising. According to Department of Health files the chief executive of Our Ladyâs Hospital, Lorcan Birthistle , was receiving total remuneration of â¬140,808 of which â¬30,000 was described as a âprivately funded allowanceâ. The income stream used to fund this allowance is generated from profits from shops on the hospital campus. âIn terms of the commercial revenue being used to top it up to a reasonable rate, and a reasonable rate is a rate that would have applied to other CEOs of Dublin hospitals, I donât have an issue with that myself,â he told RTÃâs Morning Ireland . He described the HSEâs salary scale as inappropriate. âMy first point of call would be to change the HSEâs scale, but my second point would be to make a business case that says the current salary is justified.â Mr McGinley said he was certain ââ¬110,000 is not an appropriate salary for a chief executive of a national childrenâs hospital.â He said no one in the public service should earn more than the Taoiseachâs salary of â¬185,000 and added that the salary of the chief executive at Crumlin hospital was at was âat the lowest end of any of the numbers that have appearedâ. Mr McGinley said he hoped the publicity around top-up payments would not negatively impact on fundraising. âThe salaries have been approved by the board, it is a limited company we do have responsibilities totally separate to the Minister,â he said. Mr McGinley said he would not support trying to recoup top up payments paid to the chief executive. He added that the board would not have dealt with the chief executiveâs salary and said it would have been appointed before his term on the board. âThe issue I would have is people in the public service earning more than the Taoiseach salary at â¬185,000 and I would reduce all salaries above this level.â Details of the payment emerged in confidential Department of Health files obtained by The Online News which set out publicly for the first time the total amount, including top-up payments, made to individual members of senior management across State-funded voluntary hospitals and health agencies. .

Broadband challenges TV viewing Broadband challenges TV viewing The number of Europeans with broadband has exploded over the past 12 months, with the web eating into TV viewing habits, research suggests. Just over 54 million people are hooked up to the net via broadband, up from 34 million a year ago, according to market analysts Nielsen/NetRatings. The total number of people online in Europe has broken the 100 million mark. The popularity of the net has meant that many are turning away from TV, say analysts Jupiter Research. It found that a quarter of web users said they spent less time watching TV in favour of the net The report by Nielsen/NetRatings found that the number of people with fast internet access had risen by 60% over the past year. The biggest jump was in Italy, where it rose by 120%. Britain was close behind, with broadband users almost doubling in a year. The growth has been fuelled by lower prices and a wider choice of always-on, fast-net subscription plans. "Twelve months ago high speed internet users made up just over one third of the audience in Europe; now they are more than 50% and we expect this number to keep growing," said Gabrielle Prior, Nielsen/NetRatings analyst. "As the number of high-speed surfers grows, websites will need to adapt, update and enhance their content to retain their visitors and encourage new ones." The total number of Europeans online rose by 12% to 100 million over the past year, the report showed, with the biggest rise in France, Italy, Britain and Germany. The ability to browse web pages at high speed, download files such as music or films and play online games is changing what people do in their spare time. A study by analysts Jupiter Research suggested that broadband was challenging television viewing habits. In homes with broadband, 40% said they were spending less time watching TV. The threat to TV was greatest in countries where broadband was on the up, in particular the UK, France and Spain, said the report. It said TV companies faced a major long-term threat over the next five years, with broadband predicted to grow from 19% to 37% of households by 2009. "Year-on-year we are continuing to see a seismic shift in where, when and how Europe's population consume media for information and entertainment and this has big implications for TV, newspaper and radio," said Jupiter Research analyst Olivier Beauvillian.

CSO report shows growing stock of international investment CSO report shows growing stock of international investment Public Affairs Correspondent Foreign direct investment into Ireland in 2012 was â¬30 billion, up from â¬17 billion the previous year, according to a report published yesterday by the Central Statistics Office . The report, which outlines the amount of investment abroad by Irish-based entities and the amount invested here from abroad by foreign-based entities, gives details of how money going from and coming into Ireland travels via such locations as the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Bermuda and the Cayman Islands. The report follows one published on Thursday by the American Chamber of Commerce in Ireland which said that US investment into Ireland in 2012, at $22.8 billion, was of a similar scale to all of the investment by US companies last year into developing Asia. The stock or level of foreign direct investment into Ireland increased during 2012, to â¬258 billion from â¬225 billion, with the main contributors to the incresae being from the Netherlands (â¬22 billion) and Asia (â¬5 billion), with the net figure being in part offset by decreased investment of almost â¬8 billion from the US. Annette Hayes of the CSO explained that the figures in the report show the immediate source of the money rather than the nationality of the parent company that might be involved. So an investment in an Irish subsidiary by a Dutch subsidiary of the same US multinational, is recorded as an investment from the Netherlands. While the flow of direct foreign investment into Ireland in 2012 was â¬30 billion, the difference between the stock or level of foreign direct investment in Ireland at the beginning and end of the year, is the product of the net inflow/outflow as well as revaluations and currency changes that occurred. The stock or level of foreign direct investment abroad that originated from Irish based entities increased during 2012 to â¬288 billion, from â¬256 billion at the beginning of the year. The stock of outward direct investment included â¬241 billion of equity capital and reinvested earnings. The net stock position at the end of last year was â¬31 billion, unchanged from the position at the end of last year. Direct investment flow abroad from Irish entities was â¬14 billion, a change from the â¬1 billion disinvestment the previous year. Investment abroad by Irish based entities was mainly into services, with 64 per cent of this being into the EU. The largest sector for inward investment was financial intermediation, which at the end of the year represented 44 per cent of the total. Foreign-owned direct investment enterprises earned â¬43 billion in 2012, a similar figure to the previous year. Income earned abroad by entities based here was â¬17 billion, up â¬2 billion on the previous year. The immediate sources of these earnings were: offshore centres (â¬5.5 billion); Luxembourg (â¬3 billion); the US (â¬3 billion); and the Netherlands (â¬2 billion). Flows of capital that are in the financial intermediation category often have minimal impacts on employment in the receiving jurisdictions, according to Professor Frank Barry from the Trinity College School of Business. The CSO data shows that â¬15.5 billion of the â¬30 billion direct investment flow into Ireland in 2012 fell into this category. Information and communication was â¬8 billion while total manufacturing was â¬2.19 billion. Return to results
Challenge of jobless figures flagged by IMF Challenge of jobless figures flagged by IMF Fund official notes unemployment down to 13.2% from above 15% at start of bailout IMF mission chief for Ireland Craig Beaumont: âThe most important challenge we see coming out of this programme is the high level of unemployment.â Photograph: Mark Stedman/Photocall Ireland High unemployment is the biggest challenge facing Ireland as it prepares to exit the EU-IMF troika bailout programme next month, according to the fundâs head of mission to this country. âThe most important challenge we see coming out of this programme is the high level of unemployment,â said IMF official Craig Beaumont yesterday. âIt remains high and three-fifths of the unemployed have been out of work for over a year. Some of them will find it quite difficult to regain work even as employment starts to recover.â Mr Beaumont noted that Irelandâs rate of unemployment has dropped from more than 15 per cent when the bailout commenced in late 2010 to 13.2 per cent and acknowledged that âbetter services and trainingâ were now available to the jobless. But he added that these need to be implemented âvigorouslyâ and should involve âmore resourcesâ. While stating that good progress had been made in repairing the economy, Mr Beaumont said the Government still has work to do to repair our public finances fully. âPublic debt is over 120 per cent of GDP and the deficit is still quite high. So the Government will need to continue its fiscal consolidation efforts in the next few years,â he warned. Mr Beaumont said the IMFâs preference is that broadening the tax base would be preferable to raising income tax rates, along with a tight rein on public spending. He added that our resources should be carefully targeted. âFor example, in social protection, you can focus your efforts on the lowest income members of society rather than necessarily generally providing benefits to the whole population.â This could be a reference to the Governmentâs decision in last monthâs budget to offer free GP care to all aged five and under. State raised â¬7.5bn Mr Beaumont said a âkey achievementâ of the programme was Ireland regaining access to capital markets, highlighting how we had raised â¬7.5 billion this year, including the issuance of a 10-year bond at a rate of 4.15 per cent. However, he said risks remain to Irelandâs access to markets and growth in terms of the euro areaâs strength. Mr Beaumont said âthereâs still work to be doneâ to tackle mortgage arrears and non-performing loans in the financial sector although the banks were showing improved profits this year. On mortgage arrears he said âeach case needs its own appropriate lasting remedy . . . [while there was] also a need for borrowers to work with their banksâ. He welcomed the announcement this week of a pilot scheme between AIB and the Irish Mortgage Holders Organisation to help people in arrears with the bank to engage with it via the lobby group. He said Ireland could be held up as a poster boy on how country bailouts should operate in the future. âFor us, itâs been an enormously positive experience because the authorities have shown such a strong commitment to addressing the underlying problems and strong leadership in developing the policies needed to tackle these challenges. Irelandâs progress will become an example that we will learn from in the future.â Comments are closed for this article.
Cole faces lengthy injury lay-off Cole faces lengthy injury lay-off Aston Villa's Carlton Cole could be out for six weeks with a knee injury. The striker, who is on a season-long loan from Chelsea, picked up the knock in an England Under-21 match against Holland earlier this month. "Carlton will be out of action for four to six weeks after a bad challenge," said Villa boss David O'Leary. "I won't be able to tell you whether he will need an operation until maybe next week. Whether he has an operation has got to be left to Chelsea." Cole, who also struggled with an ankle problem earlier in the season, was unable to rest because O'Leary had a shortage of strikers. The return to fitness of Darius Vassell after four months out with a broken ankle and the emergence of Luke Moore has alleviated some of the Villa's manager's problems in that department.

Cyber crime booms in 2004 Cyber crime booms in 2004 The last 12 months have seen a dramatic growth in almost every security threat that plague Windows PCs. The count of known viruses broke the 100,000 barrier and the number of new viruses grew by more than 50%. Similarly phishing attempts, in which conmen try to trick people into handing over confidential data, are recording growth rates of more than 30% and attacks are becoming increasingly sophisticated. Also on the increase are the number of networks of remotely controlled computers, called bot nets, used by malicious hackers and conmen to carry out many different cyber crimes. One of the biggest changes of 2004 was the waning influence of the boy hackers keen to make a name by writing a fast-spreading virus, said Kevin Hogan, senior manager in Symantec's security response group. Although teenage virus writers will still play around with malicious code, said Mr Hogan, 2004 saw a significant rise in criminal use of malicious programs. The financial incentives were driving criminal use of technology, he said. His comment was echoed by Graham Cluley, senior technology consultant from anti-virus firm Sophos. Mr Cluley said: "When the commercial world gets involved, things really get nasty. Virus writers and hackers will be looking to make a tidy sum." In particular, phishing attacks, which typically use fake versions of bank websites to grab login details of customers, boomed during 2004. Web portal Lycos Europe reported a 500% increase in the number of phishing e-mail messages it was catching. The Anti-Phishing Working group reported that the number of phishing attacks against new targets was growing at a rate of 30% or more per month. Those who fall victim to these attacks can find that their bank account has been cleaned out or that their good name has been ruined by someone stealing their identity. This change in the ranks of virus writers could mean the end of the mass-mailing virus which attempts to spread by tricking people into opening infected attachments on e-mail messages. "They are not an efficient way of spreading viruses," said Mr Hogan. "They are very noisy and they are not technically challenging." The opening months of 2004 did see the appearance of the Netsky, Bagle and MyDoom mass mailers, but since then more surreptitious viruses, or worms, have dominated. Mr Hogan said worm writers were more interested in recruiting PCs to take part in "bot nets" that can be used to send out spam or to mount attacks on websites. In September Symantec released statistics which showed that the numbers of active "bot computers" rose from 2,000 to 30,000 per day. Thanks to these "bot nets", spam continued to be a problem in 2004. Anti-spam firms report that, in many cases, legitimate e-mail has shrunk to less than 30% of messages. Part of the reason that these "bot nets" have become so prevalent, he said, was due to a big change in the way that many viruses were created. In the past many viruses, such as Netsky, have been the work of an individual or group. By contrast, said Mr Hogan, the code for viruses such as Gaobot, Spybot and Randex were commonly held and many groups work on them to produce new variants at the same time. The result is that now there are more than 3,000 variations of the Spybot worm. "That's unprecedented," said Mr Hogan. "What makes it difficult is that they are all co-existing with each other and do not exist in an easy to understand chronology." The emergence of the first proper virus for mobile phones was also seen in 2004. In the past, threats to smart phones have been largely theoretical because the viruses created to cripple phones existed only in the laboratory rather than the wild. In June, the Cabir virus was discovered that can hop from phone to phone using Bluetooth short-range radio technology. Also released this year was the Mosquito game for Symbian phones which surreptitiously sends messages to premium rate numbers, and in November the Skulls Trojan came to light which can cripple phones. On the positive side, Finnish security firm F-Secure said that 2004 was the best-ever year for the capture, arrest and sentencing of virus writers and criminally-minded hackers. In total, eight virus writers were arrested and some members of the so-called 29A virus writing group were sentenced. One high-profile arrest was that of German teenager Sven Jaschen who confessed to be behind the Netsky and Sasser virus families. Also shut down were the Carderplanet and Shadowcrew websites that were used to trade stolen credit card numbers. Comments are closed for this article.
DS aims to touch gamers DS aims to touch gamers The mobile gaming industry is set to explode in 2005 with a number of high-profile devices offering a range of gaming and other features such as movie and music playback. Market leader Nintendo, however, is releasing a handheld console that it says will revolutionise the way games are played. The first striking thing about the DS is how retro it looks. Far from looking like a mould-breaking handheld, it looks more like Nintendo dug out a mould from a 1980s handheld prototype. The lightweight clam shell device opens up to reveal two screens, and when switched on it instantly reveals its pedigree. Both screens are crisp and clear while the bottom of the two is touch sensitive. Nintendo has given developers free rein to utilise the dual screens and ability to control the action by simply touching the screen. The Japanese gaming giant hopes the DS will maintain the firm's pre-eminence in an increasingly-competitive mobile gaming market. Nintendo first launched its GameBoy console in 1989 and has dominated the market ever since. But its lead can no longer be taken for granted. Sony will enter the market later this year with its PlayStation Portable, while start-up companies Gizmondo and Tapwave Zodiac are also offering hybrid devices. "We believe the DS will appeal to all ages, both genders and gamers of any skill," said David Yarnton, Nintendo Europe's general manager said at the recent press launch for the handheld. With its two screens, wireless connectivity and backwards compatibility with the GameBoy Advance, the DS certainly has a number of unique selling points. It went on sale in the US in mid-November priced $150 and Nintendo says sales have exceeded expectations, without giving detailed figures. Japan and Europe will have to wait until the first quarter of 2005 to get the device. With more than two million pre-orders for the device in Japan, Nintendo is confident it will keep its number one spot. But will the device prove to be as revolutionary as claimed? The game ships with a demo of Metroid Hunters - a 3D action title which can be played alone or with a group of friends using the machine's wireless capabilities. It certainly looks impressive on the small machine and plays smoothly even with a group of people. The game can be controlled by using the supplied stylus to aim. The top screen is used to navigate the action while the bottom screen offers a top-down map and the ability to switch weapons. It is certainly a unique control method and while it makes aiming more controlled it can be a little disorientating. Super Mario 64 DS is a faithful re-creation of the Nintendo 64 classic with a host of new mini-games and new levels. The game looks stunning on the portable machine and the sound too is impressive for such a small machine. One thing is for certain. Hardened gamers will have to learn to adapt to a new way of playing while it could prove to be an accessible way in to gaming for novices, Ultimately the success or failure of the device lies in the hands of developers. If they manage to create titles which use the Nintendo DS's key features then a whole new market of gamers could open up. The fear is that the touch screen and voice recognition are treated as little more than gimmicks. Return to results
Data from overseas investigations into offshore structures to be shared with Ireland Data from overseas investigations into offshore structures to be shared with Ireland Sinn FÃ©inâs Pearse Doherty: âWe would be concerned about the growing spotlight on Ireland from our treaty partners in relation to our tax structures.â The Revenue Commissioners has recovered â¬4.3 million in settlements from 19 Irish residents whose details were among 33 names passed along by French authorities investigating tax evasion. Minister for Finance Michael Noonan has also said in a written reply to a parliamentary question that the US, Britain and Australia have advised the Revenue that they have obtained âa very significant amount of dataâ on complex offshore structures and that they intend to use this data to share information with other countries, including Ireland. The investigation was likely to take some time, due to the complexity of the data, Mr Noonan added. Sinn FÃ©in finance spokesman Pearse Doherty , who asked the parliamentary question, said the statement of intent by the three countries on the sharing of tax information indicated that Ireland had kept âits head in the sandâ around its corporation tax structures âfor far too longâ. The jurisdictions cited by Mr Noonan were all ones that had previously âput Ireland on notice that they are looking at our tax structuresâ, Mr Doherty said. âWe welcome the fact that the French have identified a number of tax evaders and that this has resulted in an extra â¬4.3 million for the exchequer. What we would be concerned about is the growing spotlight on Ireland from our treaty partners in relation to our tax structures.â Mr Doherty asked the Minister if he or any of his predecessors had received from the French government, or any government, a list of suspected tax evaders and whether he would comment on the matter. In his reply, the Minister said 33 names had been spontaneously given to the Revenue by the French ministry of finance. As well as the settlements from the 19 individuals â which followed investigations by the Revenue â there are ongoing inquiries in six other cases. Eight cases were closed as it was established there were no tax issues. A prosecution is before the courts in one case, and three other cases may lead to prosecution. The Revenue regularly receives information from French authorities under the terms of Irelandâs double taxation treaty with France and an EU directive on co-operation between member states on tax matters, Mr Noonan noted. Details of suspected cases of tax evasion may be shared between tax authorities at the request of the country that believes it is due a liability. However, information can also be given spontaneously where tax officials in one country become aware of information â for example during an audit â that could relate to the loss of tax in the other country. In 2010, French authorities gave Greece a list of more than 2,000 names of Greek individuals who had placed money in Swiss bank accounts. Return to results
Department of Health files reveal executive pay in health sector Department of Health files reveal executive pay in health sector The audit found that Our Ladyâs Hospital, Crumlin, was one of 13 agencies collectively paying about â¬900,000 to senior managers in top-up payments and benefits from non-State sources. The Statesâs largest childrenâs hospital, Our Ladyâs in Crumlin, has been paying its chief executive a top-up allowance of â¬30,000 per year funded from the profits of shops on the campus. The allowance is paid on top of a regular salary of about â¬110,000. Details of the payment emerged in confidential Department of Health files obtained by The Online News which set out publicly for the first time the total amount, including top-up payments, made to individual members of senior management across State-funded voluntary hospitals and health agencies. Our Ladyâs Hospital The audit found that Our Ladyâs Hospital was one of 13 agencies collectively paying about â¬900,000 to senior managers in top-up payments and benefits from non-State sources. The Department of Health files state that the chief executive of Our Ladyâs Hospital, Lorcan Birthistle , was receiving total remuneration of â¬140,808 of which â¬30,000 was described as a âprivately funded allowanceâ. The hospital said the chief executive âhas a contractual entitlement to payment of an allowance for the supervision of the following: auxiliary activities; income from franchises; and change management. This payment is non-pensionable and does not come from HSE or charitable funds. The income stream used to pay the allowance is generated from profits from shops on the hospital campusâ. Our Ladyâs Hospital stated: âThe allowance is a private contractual arrangement between the board and the chief executive. âThe information was provided to the audit on a confidential basis and is protected under data protection legislation. On that basis, Our Ladyâs Childrenâs Hospital Crumlin will not be making any public comment on the salary details of the private contract.â Comments are closed for this article.
Euro zone countries may not hit budget targets Euro zone countries may not hit budget targets EU commissioner Olli Rehn: warned Spain that its budgetary plans may not be sufficient to meet its budget deficit target of 2.5% next year. Photograph: David Sleator/The Online News The European Commission has issued its verdict on the budgets of euro zone countries for the first time, warning that some of the blocâs largest economies, including Spain and Italy , were in danger of breaching European deficit targets for 2014. Under new rules that came into force this year, all euro zone countries must submit their draft national budgets to Brussels before final sign off by national parliaments. In its budgetary opinions published yesterday, EU commissioner Olli Rehn said Spain, which is targeting a deficit of 5.8 per cent of GDP next year, may not achieve that. Italy, which has a relatively low deficit but one of the highest debt-to-GDP ratios in the EU, was warned that its budgetary plans may not be sufficient to meet its budget deficit target of 2.5 per cent next year. Finance ministers will review the budget plans at next Fridayâs euro group meeting. Return to results
Euro zone economy grew by disappointing 0.1% in third quarter Euro zone economy grew by disappointing 0.1% in third quarter The European Central Bank is expected to leave interest rates unchanged at the governing council meeting in Frankfurt. Photo/Bernd Kammerer The European Central Bank is expected to leave interest rates unchanged at its governing council meeting in Frankfurt, following the central bankâs surprise quarter of a percentage cut in November. With the benchmark interest rate now at a historic low of 0.25 per cent, most analysts are not expecting any interest rate cuts, despite no firm signs that the trend of low inflation in the euro zone is adjusting. A persistently low inflation rate in the euro zone â in particular a sharp drop to a four-year low of 0.7 per cent in October â prompted last monthâs decision. It is understood to have been opposed by six governing council members. Inflation did increase last month, according to the flash estimate for November, but only to 0.9 per cent, well below the ECBâs mandate to keep inflation close to but below 2 per cent. Nonetheless market watchers will be closely monitoring any signs of ECBâs intentions to engage in ânon-conventionalâ measures, such as a new long-term refinancing operations (LTRO) for banks, or an asset-buying programme. Figures published yesterday confirmed earlier estimates that the euro zone economy grew by a disappointing 0.1 per cent in the third quarter, compared to growth of 0.3 per cent in the second quarter. Manufacturing figures also showed a slowdown in manufacturing activity in the euro area. Comments are closed for this article.
Euro zone inflation at lowest level in almost four years Euro zone inflation at lowest level in almost four years Falling fuel and telecoms prices help slow inflation to 0.7 per cent Falling fuel and telecoms prices pulled euro zone inflation down to its lowest level in almost four years in October, data showed today, fleshing out the surprise drop that prompted the European Central Bank to cut interest rates to a record low. Consumer price inflation in the 17 nations sharing the euro was 0.7 per cent last month, the EUâs statistics office Eurostat said, confirming its earlier estimate that is far below the ECB target of just under 2 per cent. On an annual basis, falling fuel costs for heating and transport, as well as telecoms, had the biggest impact on the inflation rate, offsetting rises in electricity and rent. Heating oil fell by the most in October compared to the year earlier period, followed by fuels and then telecoms, Eurostat said. After Eurostat released its flash reading on October 31st, the ECB cut its main refinancing rate on November 7th by 25 basis points to 0.25 per cent, warning of the risk of âa prolonged period of low inflationâ as the euro zone struggles to recover from recession. The inflation rate dropped below 1 per cent for the first time since February 2010. Stripping out volatile energy and food and tobacco costs, inflation was 0.8 per cent in October. Europe is yet to face a negative inflation rate or a Japanese-style deflationary spiral when falling prices weaken demand, leading to wage cuts and even lower prices. But consumer prices actually fell in October from September, by 0.1 per cent, Eurostat said in its more detailed reading that laid out the pace of prices rises and falls across all sectors. Making the ECBâs job all the harder, inflation varied widely across the euro zone, ranging from outright deflation in Ireland, Cyprus and Greece to inflation of 1.2 per cent in Germany, 1.7 per cent in Finland and 2.2 per cent in Estonia, the highest annual rate in the region. France, Belgium and Slovakia registered inflation at same level as the euro zoneâs average rate of 0.7 per cent. (Online News) .

Exports up by 4% in August, CSO statistics show Exports up by 4% in August, CSO statistics show Earnings from overseas travellers rose 5.2 % between second quarter of this year and last Ciara Kenny, Dan Keenan The Irish export sector appears to be recovering slowly, as figures released by the Central Statistics Office show a rise in the level of exports in August after a poor performance earlier in the year. The value of Irish exports on a seasonally adjusted basis was â¬7.64 billion, which is 4 per cent higher than July and 7 per cent higher than average monthly exports in the first seven months of the year. When compared with last August, however, the value of exports was down 17 per cent to â¬6.96 billion in the month, due to exceptionally high exports in August 2012. Exports of organic chemicals fell â¬579 million on a year-on-year basis, while medical and pharmaceutical exports were down â¬422 million, largely due to a number of Irish-manufactured drugs coming off patent this year. Exports to the European Union accounted for 56 per cent of the total in August. The US was the main destination outside the EU, taking 21 per cent of exports. Imports up The value of imports increased by 1 per cent, or â¬39 million, to â¬3.9 billion comparing August to the same month in 2012. Imports of petrol and related products accounted for the most significant increase, rising 32 per cent in the period. Some 64 per cent of goods imported into the Republic in the month came from within the EU, with 31 per cent coming from the UK. The US was the main source of non-EU imports, accounting for 11 per cent of the total, followed by China at 8 per cent. âThe export sector has been the main driver of Irish economic activity in recent times and will remain the key growth engine for some period to come,â said Merrion Stockbrokersâ economist Alan McQuaid in a note. Global demand âWeak global demand has hit Irish exports in the past couple of years, particularly on the merchandise goods side. But there are signs now that the world economy, including the key markets of the United States , Eurozone and UK, is starting to recover, which augurs well for Irish exports in the coming months.â Merrion Stockbrokers is forecasting a flat performance for exports this year, even allowing for a pick-up in activity in the latter part of the year. Separate CSO figures showed yesterday that overseas trips to Ireland by non-residents increased from 1.817 million in the second quarter of 2012 to 1.893 million trips in the same period of this year. The number of nights spent in the State by overseas travellers increased by 4.8 per cent in the second quarter of this year compared with the same period of last year. In real terms this points to a rise from 12.7 million to 13.3 million. Overseas travellers Total tourism and travel earnings from overseas travellers to Ireland increased by 5.2 per cent between the second quarter of 2012 and the second quarter of this year, increasing from â¬1,048 million to â¬1,103 million. In the second quarter of this year, the number of trips made by Irish residents overseas increased 1.4 per cent to 1.752 million trips, up from 1.727 million in the same quarter of last year. Total tourism and travel expenditure by Irish residents overseas increased 3.7 per cent, from â¬1,054 million in the second quarter of last year to â¬1,093 million in the second quarter of this year. .

Extra jobs boosting income tax take and spending, say analysts Extra jobs boosting income tax take and spending, say analysts Official figures expected to show a further fall in employment last month The Government spent â¬60.08 billion up to the end of November, 0.8 per cent less than in the same period in 2012, and 4.4 per cent less than its target of â¬62.85 billion. Exchequer returns showing a boost to income taxes and VAT yesterday sparked claims that increased employment and earnings are starting to feed through to the wider economy. The news comes ahead of official statistics due to be released today that are expected to show a further fall in unemployment last month. The Department of Finance yesterday published monthly Exchequer figures showing that the total tax take in the 11 months to the end of November was â¬35.2 billion, 4.2 per cent ahead of the take during the same period in 2012. The total was also ahead of the â¬34.97 billion budget target. The numbers also showed Revenue collected â¬2.35 billion in income tax in November alone, almost 8 per cent more than the â¬2.2 billion returned during the same month in 2012. Income tax for the first 11 months of 2013 was up 4.4 per cent, at â¬14.5 billion, but the total was just short of the Government target of â¬14.55 billion. VAT returns rose strongly, delivering â¬1.63 billion to Government coffers in November, up 9.5 per cent on last year. Ahead of forecasts Commenting on the figures, Peter Vale , tax partner at Grant Thornton pointed out income tax was 2.4 per cent ahead of forecasts. âEven more positively, strong earnings are now being reflected in peopleâs spending behaviour, with VAT receipts ahead of target for the first time this year,â he said. âWe are finally seeing positive employment and earnings growth translating into increased activity in the domestic economy.â He added this should give retailers cause to hope that Christmas spending would be strong. Ministers heard yesterday the CSO will publish figures today showing unemployment fell again in November. The office last week said the number of people at work grew 58,000 in the first nine months of the year to 1.89 million. Minister for Finance, Michael Noonan , said November was the single most important month for Exchequer returns. âThe strong performance set out in todayâs figures is hard evidence that the recovery seen in the high frequency data is taking hold across the economy.â Total revenues Total revenues, tax and non- tax, for the 11-month period, were â¬51.5 billion, 8.3 per cent ahead of the same period last year, and 5 per cent up on the â¬49 billion budget target. The Government spent â¬60.08 billion up to the end of November, 0.8 per cent less than in the same period in 2012, and 4.4 per cent less than its target of â¬62.85 billion. Return to results
Featured: 'Blog' picked as word of the year 'Blog' picked as word of the year The term "blog" has been chosen as the top word of 2004 by a US dictionary publisher. Merriam-Webster said "blog" headed the list of most looked-up terms on its site during the last twelve months. During 2004 blogs, or web logs, have become hugely popular and some have started to influence mainstream media. Other words on the Merriam-Webster list were associated with major news events such as the US presidential election or natural disasters that hit the US. Merriam-Webster defines a blog as: "a Web site that contains an online personal journal with reflections, comments and often hyperlinks". Its list of most looked-up words is drawn up every year and it discounts terms such as swear words, that everyone likes to look up, or those that always cause problems, such as "affect" and "effect". Merriam-Webster said "blog" was the word that people have asked to be defined or explained most often over the last 12 months. The word will now appear in the 2005 version of Merriam-Webster's printed dictionary. However, the word is already included in some printed versions of the Oxford English Dictionary. A spokesman for the Oxford University Press said that the word was now being put into other dictionaries for children and learners, reflecting its mainstream use. "I think it was the word of last year rather than this year," he said. "Now we're getting words that derive from it such as 'blogosphere' and so on," he said. "But," he added, "it's a pretty recent thing and in the way that this happens these days it's got established very quickly." Blogs come in many different forms. Many act as news sites for particular groups or subjects, some are written from a particular political slant and others are simply lists of interesting sites. Other terms in the top 10 were related to natural disasters that have struck the US, such as "hurricane" or were to do with the US election. Words such as "incumbent", "electoral" and "partisan" reflected the scale of interest in the vote. Blogs also proved very useful to both sides in the US election battle because many pundits who maintain their own journals were able to air opinions that would never appear in more mainstream media. Speculation that President Bush was getting help during debates via a listening device was first aired on web logs. Online journals also raised doubts about documents used by US television news organisation CBS in a story about President Bush's war record. The immediacy of many blogs also helped some wield influence over topics that made it in to national press. This is despite the fact that the number of people reading even the most influential blogs is tiny. Statistics by web influence ranking firm HitWise reveal that the most popular political blog racks up only 0.0051% of all net visits per day. One of the reasons that blogs and regularly updated online journals have become popular is because the software used to put them together make it very easy for people to air their views online. According to blog analysis firm Technorati the number of blogs in existence, the blogosphere, has doubled every five and a half months for the last 18 months. Technorati now estimates that the number of blogs in existence has exceeded 4.8 million. Some speculate that less than a quarter of this number are regularly maintained. According to US research firm Pew Internet & American Life a blog is created every 5.8 seconds. Another trend this year has been the increasing numbers of weblogs that detail the daily lives of many ordinary workers in jobs that few people know much about. In many repressive regimes and developing nations, blogs have been embraced by millions of people keen to give their plight a voice. Comments are closed for this article.
Featured: 'No re-draft' for EU patent law 'No re-draft' for EU patent law A proposed European law on software patents will not be re-drafted by the European Commission (EC) despite requests by MEPs. The law is proving controversial and has been in limbo for a year. Some major tech firms say it is needed to protect inventions, while others fear it will hurt smaller tech firms. The EC says the Council of Ministers will adopt a draft version that was agreed upon last May but said it would review "all aspects of the directive". The directive is intended to offer patent protection to inventions that use software to achieve their effect, in other words, "computer implemented invention". In a letter, EC President Jos&#233; Manuel Barroso told the President of the European Parliament, Josep Borrell, that the Commission "did not intend to refer a new proposal to the Parliament and the Council (of ministers)" as it had supported the agreement reached by ministers in May 2004. If the European Council agrees on the draft directive it will then return for a second reading at the European Parliament. But that will not guarantee that the directive will become law - instead it will probably mean further delays and controversy over the directive. Most EU legislation now needs the approval of both parliament and the Council of Ministers before it becomes law. French Green MEP Alain Lipietz warned two weeks ago that if the Commission ignored the Parliament's request it would be an "insult" to the assembly. He said that the parliament would then reject the Council's version of the legislation as part of the final or conciliation stage of the decision procedure. In the US, the patenting of computer programs and internet business methods is permitted. This means that the US-based Amazon.com holds a patent for its "one-click shopping" service, for example. Critics are concerned that the directive could lead to a similar model happening in Europe. This, they fear, could hurt small software developers because they do not have the legal and financial might of larger companies if they had to fight patent legal action in court. Supporters say current laws are inefficient and it would serve to even up a playing field without bringing EU laws in line with the US. Comments are closed for this article.

Fed committed to âultra-easy monetary policyâ for as long as needed Fed committed to âultra-easy monetary policyâ for as long as needed Bernanke says while US economy has made progress, there is still some way to go US Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke (right) takes the stage to address the National Economists Club annual dinner at the US chamber of commerce in Washington. Photograph: Jonathan Ernst/Online News US Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke said last night the Fed will maintain ultra-easy US monetary policy for as long as needed, which could mean holding interest rates near zero until âwell afterâ US unemployment falls under 6.5 per cent. In a speech to the National Economists Club that echoed dovish comments by his nominated successor, Janet Yellen , Mr Bernanke also said that while the economy had made significant progress, it was still far from where officials wanted it to be. âThe FOMC remains committed to maintaining highly accommodative policies for as long as they are needed,â he told the club, referring to the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee . US president Barack Obama nominated Ms Yellen, the Fedâs current vice chair, to replace Mr Bernanke when his term ends on January 31st. The Fed has held interest rates near zero since late 2008 and quadrupled its balance sheet to $3.9 trillion through three massive rounds of bond buying. It decided in October to maintain asset purchases at an $85 billion monthly pace. Mr Bernanke said officials want evidence of durable job growth before scaling back buying. âThe FOMC still expects that labor market conditions will continue to improve and that inflation will move toward the 2 per cent objective over the medium term. If these views are supported by incoming information, the FOMC will likely begin to moderate the pace of purchases,â he said. Fed officials meet next on December 17th-18th, although most economists do not think they will begin to scale back the bond buying until their meeting in either January or March.

Former Central Remedial Clinic chief executive Paul Kiely had Fianna FÃ¡il links Former Central Remedial Clinic chief executive Paul Kiely had Fianna FÃ¡il links Kiely, a key part of former taoiseachâs âDrumcondra Mafiaâ, among number of board members associated with Bertie Ahern The recently-retired chief executive of the Central Remedial Clinic Paul Kiely with former Minister for Health Mr Michael Woods. Fiach Kelly chief executive of the Central Remedial Clinic , is just one of a number of figures from the organisation with strong connections to Fianna FÃ¡il , and Bertie Ahern in particular. Mr Kiely and Mr Ahern go back to the 1970s, when they worked in the Mater hospital together, alongside the now deceased Tony Kett , who later became a Fianna FÃ¡il senator and was described by Mr Ahern as one of his âclosest friendsâ. Mr Kett went on to work as an administrator in the CRC, which also nominated him as a candidate for the Seanad. A key part of Mr Ahernâs âDrumcondra Mafiaâ, Mr Kiely was sometimes perceived as the brains of the former taoiseachâs formidable constituency organisation from the 1970s onwards. Inner circle However, those who worked with Mr Ahern during his time as Taoiseach say Mr Kiely was never seen around central government, as others in the inner circle were. âHe was certainly part of that Drumcondra set but we would never really have seen him around Government Buildings,â said one source, while another said his involvement may have dropped off in later years. âIn my time I donât think I ever saw him in Government Buildings, my sense of it is he just kind of dropped away in terms of political stuff. But there is no doubt he is Bertieâs pal. You would often hear Bertie had gone off to meet him or have a pint.â Mr Kiely was also appointed to the board of the CIE in 1998, which came with a Â£5,000 fee, and ended up as chairman of the companyâs audit committee. However, those around the Dublin Central constituency say his involvement decreased during Mr Ahernâs later years in power. St Lukeâs âMy experience of him he was a nice person, a reasonable person,â one figure involved in the constituency said. âBut he kind of went out of it around 2007, I didnât see him much towards the end of Bertieâs time.â Despite this, Mr Kiely was still there in St Lukeâs on December 30th, 2010, when Mr Ahern announced his retirement from politics. His spell as chief executive of the CRC stretched from 1988 until 2012, but he still remains on as a director. Other board members include former Fianna FÃ¡il chief whip and Charles Haughey ally Vincent Brady , as well as James Nugent , who told the Mahon tribunal he gave Mr Ahern Â£2,500 as part of whip-around. The CRCâs founder Lady Valerie Goulding struck up a friendship with Mr Haughey after his arms trail in the 1970s, and Mr Haughey headed up the CRCâs fundraising committee. Lady Goulding was later made a Taoiseachâs appointee to the Seanad by Jack Lynch Her son Hamilton now sits on the board, and Des Peelo , the accountant who represented Mr Ahern and Mr Haughey during tribunal hearings, was also a director of the CRC.

Friendâs death prompts actor to seek âsimple and transformational changesâ Friendâs death prompts actor to seek âsimple and transformational changesâ Gabriel Byrne addresses the New York audience Actor Gabriel Byrne has spoken emotionally about the death of a friend in a Dublin hospital in an appeal for âsimple and transformational changesâ to the care shown to terminally ill patients. At the launch of a US fundraising push by the Irish Hospice Foundation in New York, Byrne said that the clinical culture and physical surroundings within Irish hospitals often contribute to the trauma felt by dying people and their loved ones. âI attended the bedside of a friend who was dying in a Dublin hospital. She lived her last hours in a public ward with a television blaring out a football match, all but drowning our final conversation,â he said at the launch of the charityâs Design and Dignity Fund in the United States . âI looked around this depressing place, with the cheap curtain separating her from other patients, walls painted nondescriptly institutional, the awful food, the ubiquitous smell of disinfectant mixed with human odour, and I began to think about the physical environment in which we might spend our final hours, that space which, as the late Seamus Heaney said, is âemptiedâ and âpure changeâ happens,â said Byrne, patron of the foundation. âI have since come to believe that in hospital aesthetics are as important as function, that both are in fact closely linked. And that an aesthetic environment automatically leads to good practice and better care.â The purpose of the fund is to raise money to pay for the redesign of rooms in Irish hospitals to create a more sympathetic environment to the needs of the dying. Byrne, who is based in New York, said that the charityâs fund was already helping to create spaces where âbad news can be broken, where those who have got the dreaded call to fly home to be with a loved one near death can have the space and the privacy for final wordsâ. Emigrants journey Hosted by prominent Irish-Americans Loretta Brennan Glucksman and Tom Moran , president and chief executive of Mutual America, the launch was also attended by author Colum McCann, who spoke of the ârawnessâ of the journey many Irish emigrants make to visit a dying loved one at home. âWhen you lose a loved one and when you know that person is being looked after well, itâs so much easier to return. Itâs also much easier to come back to your other life,â he said. Michael OâReilly, chairman of the Design and Dignity project, said that when people are beyond cure it becomes a âsacred obligationâ to attend to death with care and dignity. Proceeds from the new book, The Gathering â Reflections on Ireland , which includes contributions on Irish identity by Bono, McCann, Brian OâDriscoll and Heaney, go to the fund. The US launch of the book also took place at last nightâs charity event. Comments are closed for this article.
Games enter the classroom Games enter the classroom Video games could soon be transplanted from their natural habitat to the more academic atmosphere of the classroom. With violent titles continuing to top the charts, gaming and learning have not always sat well together but the tide could be beginning to turn. Recent research by the London Institute of Education concluded that games have a valid place in the classroom. "Games teach life skills such as decision making, problem solving," said Martin Owen, at Futurelab. Mr Owen said games could also help children make quick assessments of situations and learning by trial and error. Futurelab is a non-profit organisation looking at ways of using technology for innovative learning. Most game firms are too busy turning a profit in the lucrative commercial market to consider developing games for use in schools but Liverpool-based games firm Lateral Visions saw a gap in the market. "Learning games were somewhat old-fashioned and we didn't see anyone else doing what we wanted to do," said Dr Carl Gavin, managing director of Lateral Visions. The company set out to write something that had all the look and feel of a commercial game but with an educational and learning element. The result is Racing Academy, a massively multiplayer car racing game, which requires not only a thirst for speed but a working knowledge of physics and engineering as well. It is being used by Futurelab to test the viability of using gaming in the classroom. "We are keen to find out whether alongside learning a game, we can also learn something that the rest of the world can understand as being educational," said Mr Owen. Players will have to understand how a car works in order to win races and the knowledge of physics and engineering that they gather along the way will be done in a way that no text book can teach. The game requires users to build and maintain their vehicles and to monitor and analyse performance using data from a variety of outputs, before and after racing. Teamwork is essential and a chat area allows students to exchange information and data, work collaboratively and review their own performances. This fusion of chatrooms and gaming is of special interest to Futurelab as it is through talking to others that much of the learning can be achieved, thinks Mr Owen. The game has been trialled in two secondary schools in Bristol and feedback from students has been positive. "Pupils used the statistics to work out the best way to build their cars and the online message board to share ideas and support each other," said Ben Williamson, a researcher at Futurelab charged with testing the game in real schools. Dr Gavin thinks the game satisfies both teachers' need for learning outcomes and the children's desire to rise to a challenge. "Games in the classroom need to support the teacher. It is not about giving children free rein to play game but recognising that games attract attention and offer a challenge," he said. Professor Angela MacFarlane, based at Bristol University, has spent several years researching how games can be incorporated into classrooms. Use of games in schools has been patchy she found, with Sim City proving the most popular. Traditionally schools have eschewed mainstream games in favour of used so-called edu-tainment software in a belief that such packages help to make learning fun, she found in her research. "It is perhaps in a compromise between edutainment and mainstream games that the greatest potential for classroom useable games lies," she wrote in a paper entitled Games and Learning. 'Lite' versions of existing games could be the way forward and would overcome one of the biggest hurdles - persuading developers to write for the educational market. This would appeal to developers because of the low costs involved in adapting them as well as offering a new opportunity for marketing. Already there are games on the market, such as Civilisation and Age of Empire, that have educational elements said Mr Owen. "Even in Grand Theft Auto it is not just the violence that engages people," he said. It could be some time until that particular game makes it into the classroom though. Return to results
General deficit stood at â¬2.49 billion in June General deficit stood at â¬2.49 billion in June General Government net worth - which takes into account its non financial assets as well as financial assets less liabilities - fell in the second quarter of the year, reaching -â¬84.4 billion from -â¬81.8 billion in the previous three-month period. Irelandâs general government deficit fell to 6 per cent of gross domestic product in the second quarter of the year, new data from the Central Statistics Office showed. That compares with 8.3 per cent in the same quarter a year earlier. Government debt, meanwhile, was higher during the three month period and general Government net worth - which takes into account its non financial assets as well as financial assets less liabilities - also fell, reaching -â¬84.4 billion from -â¬81.8 billion in the first quarter.

Gizmondo gadget hits the shelves Gizmondo gadget hits the shelves The Gizmondo combined media player, phone and gaming gadget goes on sale on Saturday. Priced at Â£229, the handheld device is debuting in the UK and goes on sale in the US and mainland Europe in the next few weeks. A catalogue of about 20 games is being prepared for the gadget including The Great Escape and Conflict Vietnam. The British-backed gadget faces stiff competition from handheld gaming devices made by Nintendo and Sony. The Gizmondo device packs a lot of functions inside its black cover and is aimed at gamers and those that want more from their game-playing gadgets. It can be used to play games, music tracks and movies. It can take and store digital photos and be used like a mobile phone to send text, multimedia and e-mail messages. The phone service to enable people to send messages is being provided by pre-pay Vodafone accounts bundled in with the device. It also works with GPS (Global Position System) so can also be used as a navigation aid or to support a variety of location-based services. The GPRS and Bluetooth wireless data systems onboard mean that it can be used for multi-player gaming. The gadget will be available from the Gizmondo store on London's Regent Street and from several other retail partners. Although the device rolls together an impressive list of functions, it will face serious competition from three established names in mobile gaming: Nintendo, Nokia and Sony. The main competition is likely to come from Nintendo and Sony. Nintendo's DS handheld went on sale on 11 March and priced at Â£99 costs far less than the Gizmondo. It also has a ready pool of fans of earlier Nintendo handhelds to draw on. In the first two days it was on sale in Europe the 87,000 DS handhelds were sold - a better debut than the GameCube enjoyed. Sony's PSP was due to make its European debut in March but now this is likely to be delayed by a few months. The PSP is due to go on sale in the US later this month and a bundle including the player, accessories and a copy of Spiderman 2 is expected to cost about $250 (Â£129). The PSP can also play music and movies and supports wireless multiplayer gaming. Nokia's N-Gage could also be a competitor on the telecommunications side. This too crams a fully functional phone into a gadget that also plays games. Return to results
Government âignoring mid-sized companiesâ in favour of multinationals and start-ups Government âignoring mid-sized companiesâ in favour of multinationals and start-ups Irish Stock Exchange chief calls for more balanced enterprise policy to support indigneous companies Deirdre Somers, chief executive of the Irish Stock Exchange: The Government is ignoring Irelandâs mid-size companies. Photograph: The Online News The Government is ignoring Irelandâs mid-size companies in favour of an enterprise policy aimed at supporting multinationals and start-ups, Irish Stock Exchange (ISE) chief executive Deirdre Somers has said. Speaking at a Funding for Growth conference in Dublin, Ms Somers said Ireland needed a more balanced enterprise policy to enable the growth of a strong indigenous enterprise sector. âDeveloping more home-grown success stories, which are capable of earning money abroad and spending it on creating jobs at home, can make a major and sustainable contribution to the economic and social life of this country.â She said the Government should stop taxing investment in Ireland and Irish companies by charging stamp duty on investors who buy shares. âThe current taxation of share options makes it hugely unattractive for entrepreneurs to share in the benefits of growing their business to scale. A profound rethink about how we tax capital, share options and exits is necessary.â Ms Somers said Irelandâs low corporation tax was not enough to deliver successful mid-market companies (those with annual turnover of more than â¬20 million and profits of more than â¬3 million), adding that a change in policy was needed. Department of Finance secretary general John Moran told the conference, organised by the ISE, that there needed to be a change in the culture âright through schools and universityâ for people to have the belief they could set up a company and have it succeed, IPO and go global. He said that private savers also needed to invest in companies or the Government would run out of resources. âThe Government canât fund everythingâ¦domestic savings should be driving a lot of this.â Openet founder and chief technology officer Joe Hogan said Ireland needed to have incentives for companies to become mid-sized and not sell out too early/at the first offer. âCompensation drives behaviourâ¦there needs to be incentives to invest.â Comments are closed for this article.
Gunners clock up winning record Gunners clock up winning record Arsenal claimed the Premiership title and re-wrote the record books in the process by going the entire 38-game season unbeaten. It was the first time a team had gone through a top-flight season undefeated since Preston in the 1888-89 season. Arsenal romped home by a convincing 11-point margin from Chelsea. The closest they came to defeat was in the so-called "Battle of Old Trafford" when Ruud van Nistelrooy missed a last-minute penalty in a goalless draw. It was a game that cast a shadow over the season, with Van Nistelrooy surrounded by angry Arsenal players. Arsenal's Lauren was banned for four games, Martin Keown three matches and Ray Parlour one after the incident. Manchester United pair Ryan Giggs and Cristiano Ronaldo were also fined for their part in the fracas. Arsenal's title triumph made up for more disappointment on the European stage, where they lost to Chelsea in the Champions League quarter-finals. Arsene Wenger's side looked on course to finally end their Champions League drought, particularly after winning 5-1 away to Inter Milan. But in a twist on their domestic domination, Chelsea won 2-1 at Highbury to clinch a 3-2 aggregate victory. Manchester United fared even worse, going out to Porto when Francisco Costina scored a last-minute Old Trafford equaliser. United finished third in the league, but had an FA Cup win for consolation. Porto's success introduced manager Jose Mourinho to a wider audience, and particularly Chelsea. Chelsea manager Claudio Ranieri lived under a cloud of speculation all season, particulary claims he would be replaced by Sven-Goran Eriksson. It intensified when Eriksson was caught holding talks with Chelsea chief executive Peter Kenyon. An embarrassed England coach was then awarded a new four-year contract by the Football Association. Ranieri sealed his fate with a series of bizarre substitutions as Chelsea lost 3-1 in the first leg of the Champions League semi-final in Monaco. And when he inevitably lost his job, it was Mourinho, who went on to win the Champions League with Porto, who stepped in to take over. Mourinho's reign began well, with Chelsea topping the Premiership at Christmas and joining Arsenal, Manchester United and Liverpool in the next phase of the Champions League. Another manager to lose his job was Liverpool's Gerard Houllier, whose reign ended after six years. Houllier paid the price for finishing fourth and without a trophy last term. He was replaced by Valencia's Rafael Benitez, whose impressive credentials included winning Spain's La Liga and the Uefa Cup last season. Valencia beat Marseille 2-0 to cement Benitez's growing reputation. Manchester United enjoyed their moment of glory by beating Millwall 3-0 in the FA Cup final in Cardiff. Ruud van Nistelrooy struck twice and Cristiano Ronaldo was also on target at Dennis Wise's side were outclassed by their Premiership opponents. Wolves lost their Premiership status, along with Leicester City and Leeds United, who completed a stunning decline from grace. Leeds had reached the Champions League semi-final three years before they went down after defeat at Bolton. The three were replaced by Norwich, West Brom and Crystal Palace, who beat West Ham in the play-off in Cardiff. The summer saw big-spending in the transfer market, with Wayne Rooney the central figure in the drama. Teenager Rooney returned to Everton after Euro 2004 with superstar status assured after stunning performances. And when he refused to sign a new five-year contract, Newcastle United opened the bidding at Â£20m. A transfer request followed and Manchester United completed a Â£27m deal just hours before the transfer window closed at the end of August. Rooney confirmed his worth with a hat-trick on his debut in the Champions League against Fenerbahce. Chelsea, inevitably, were among the big-spenders again, splashing out Â£24m on Marseille's Didier Drogba and Â£20m on Porto defender Ricardo Carvalho. Last and by no means least, the other major piece of domestic silverware went to Middlesbrough, who ended 128 barren years by winning the Carling Cup. They beat Bolton 2-1 in the final with goals from Joseph-Desire Job and a penalty from Boudewijn Zenden. The pressures of the top-flight were cruelly illustrated at Southampton. Paul Sturrock was sacked only two games into the new season, one of which was a win against Blackburn, and only 13 games in total at St Mary's. Another manager to pay the price early-season was West Brom's Gary Megson, who was sacked after revealing he would not renew his contract. He guided West Brom back into the Premiership, but his relationship with chairman Jeremy Peace was fragile. Bryan Robson succeeded him as he returned to his old club. In Scotland, Henrik Larsson bid an emotional and successful farewell to Celtic after seven glorious seasons. Celtic won the league and also the Scottish Cup, beating Dunfermline 3-1 in the final, with the Swede scoring twice to take his season's tally to 41. And it took his overall Celtic goals record to 242 goals in 315 appearances before joining Barcelona. Underdogs Livingston claimed the CIS Insurance Cup with a 2-0 win against Hibs, a victory for the romantics. Comments are closed for this article.
HSE to request increased staffing for maternity hospitals HSE to request increased staffing for maternity hospitals Dr Peter Boylan says HIQA report is an âappalling indictment of State failureâ Dr Peter Boylan clinical director of the National Maternity Hospital who said the HIQA report was an appalling indictment of State failures over many years. Photograph: Brenda Fitzsimons/The Online News The Health Service Executive is to request an increase in staffing for maternity services following the publication of a report which found significant deficiencies in the care of critically ill women in the Stateâs 19 maternity hospitals. HSE National Director of Quality and Patient Safety Dr Philip Crowley said this morning that it was recognised âif you have adequate staffing levels in terms of midwives and consultants we can provide a more consultant-led serviceâ. He said the current maternity service numbers do not allow for that and that a request in relation to increased staffing would be made to the Minister for Health. He was responding to comments from the clinical director of the National Maternity Hospital who said staffing levels in Irish maternity hospitals were unacceptably low. The Health Information and Quality Authority report into the death of Savita Halappanavar published yesterday found significant deficiencies in the care of critically ill women in maternity hospitals. It pointed to 13 âmissed opportunitiesâ that, had they been identified and acted upon, could have resulted in a different outcome for Ms Halappanavar, who died in University Hospital Galway last October. Hiqa identified shortcomings in maternity care generally and has called for a national review of maternity services. Dr Boylan described the report as an âappalling indictment of State failures over many yearsâ in the provision of a safe maternity service infrastructure, with the lack of staff a key issue. âIf you take the minimum recommended number of consultant obstetricians for the number of births, not including gynaecology, there should be at least 200 in the state, but thereâs 120, so we are far behind.â âIn the National Maternity Hospital we have the equivalent of eight consultants, whereas if we were in Denmark or Norway or Sweden, weâd have about 50.â He also said staffing levels in Irish maternity hospitals are 30 per cent lower than recommended international standards. Mr Boylan also identified a number of failings in the HIQA report, including that while it identified failings in the care of Ms Halappanavar, it did not state what staff in University Hospital Galway should have done differently in this case. He also said the law on terminations âundoubtedly inhibitedâ the medical team in Galway from intervening and delivering Ms Halappanavar when intervention by delivery would have saved her life. Dr Boylan said this aspect was âdeliberately left out of the reportâ because the question was not asked because it was not in the terms of reference and that this was a âdeliberate omission on the part of the HSE which commissioned the report.â âThe State commissioned the report but didnât ask the obvious question,â he told RTÃâs Morning Ireland.

Health bodies breach policy with â¬200,000 packages Health bodies breach policy with â¬200,000 packages Master of Rotunda on more than â¬306,000, including on-call allowance of â¬49,545 Figures released by the Department of Health show senior staff working in State-funded disability and maternity services are receiving total packages of well over â¬200,000 per year in some cases. Photograph: Frank Miller 10.3.05 Martin Wall, Pamela Duncan, Carl O'Brien One in four of the countryâs 43 State-funded voluntary hospitals and health agencies have told the Government they are breaching official policy on pay for senior executives. Figures released by the Department of Health show senior staff working in State-funded disability and maternity services are receiving total packages of well over â¬200,000 per year in some cases. The total remuneration in many cases is made up of a combination of HSE-funded salaries and top-up payments from private sources, such as the proceeds from on-campus retail outlets. Department of Health files dated from May this year â and which predate cuts introduced under the Haddington Road agreement â show for the first time the level of earnings of senior managers in voluntary hospitals and health agencies. A number of health bodies last night disputed the details set out in the Department of Health figures that were drawn up as part of a recent HSE internal audit. However senior health service sources maintained the figures were those which the agencies had themselves submitted. At the end of September, the HSE asked the voluntary hospitals and agencies to confirm that executive pay was in line with Government policy. Internal HSE figures show that 10 agencies indicated that they were breaching pay policy. The HSE figures also show that six agencies confirmed they were in compliance, while 11 others had not replied by early November. The HSE has taken this as an indication that they were in compliance. Total package The Department of Health file states the master of the Rotunda Hospital in Dublin was receiving a total package of more than â¬306,000. This included a HSE salary of â¬236,000, as well as an on-call allowance of â¬49,545 and a separate privately funded allowance of â¬20,000. The file said the master of the National Maternity Hospital was receiving a package of â¬281,892. This was composed of a HSE-funded salary of â¬183,562, as well as an allowance of â¬53,009 and a separate private-funded allowance of â¬45,000. Neither hospital responded to queries put to them last night.The publicly funded element of these payments would have been reduced under the Haddington Road deal which came into force in July. The Department of Health report also states that the chief executive of the Central Remedial Clinic (CRC) received a total package of â¬242,865. This comprised a HSE-funded salary of â¬106,900, a CRC-funded salary of â¬116,949 and a separate CRC-funded allowance of â¬19,016. The CRC described the Department of Health report as âhistoricâ and said it did not provide a current picture of staff remuneration at the organisation. The CRC also did not answer questions as to whether revenue generated from fundraising activities was used to supplement State-funded payments. The Department of Health files state that the chief executive of Stewarts Hospital, which operates in the disability sector, had a salary of almost â¬175,000 and a motor allowance of â¬18,000. Stewarts Hospital said yesterday the salary of its current chief executive was in compliance with the consolidated scales and official circulars. Comments are closed for this article.
Honohan addresses conference on lessons to be drawn from financial crash Honohan addresses conference on lessons to be drawn from financial crash Irelandâs banking system had assets worth nine times the countryâs GDP just before the State went into financial meltdown in 2008, according to Central Bank governor Patrick Honohan . However, he said it would be misleading to draw a simple conclusion about the financial collapse from this âheadline factâ. Prof Honohan was addressing a banking conference in Reykjavik, organised by the Central Bank of Iceland. One of the chief similarities between the recent financial blowouts in Ireland , Iceland and Cyprus was that all three countries had big banking sectors relative to the size of their economies. Having an undeveloped banking system - one that is small relative to the size of the economy - initially acts as a restraint on growth, Prof Honohan said. This relationship held true until the bank-to-GDP ratio got to about 100 per cent. However, beyond this point, he said there was little evidence of a âgrowth-enhancing functionâ from having a large banking system. Equally, rapid growth in a banking systemâs credit to the domestic economy had been âlong-known as a risk factor for financial instability.â The ultimate lesson of the crash was that if large banking systems with access to foreign finance became involved in providing credit to the local economy âthey had the capacity to rapidly destabilise itâ. In Irelandâs case, Prof Honohan identified four different types of banks operating in the sector at the time of the crash. Locally controlled banks, servicing the domestic economy, made up about 44 per cent of the system, he said. A further 12 per cent comprised subsidiaries and branches of foreign-controlled banks dealing with the domestic economy. There were also foreign-owned entities involved in exporting services, which accounted for about 19 per cent of the system, and which ultimately failed because of the subprime crisis. Prof Honohan identified a final and fourth category of other foreign-owned concerns, which also used Ireland as an export base, but which remained âsolidâ after the crash. While the first three categories got into trouble and âhad to be rescuedâ, he said only the locally-controlled banks were implicated in the fiscal cost to the Government. âThe wider destabilisation of the Irish economy, including the boom and bust in property prices which has left a large section of the household sector under stress of over-indebtedness, was created by the first two categories of bank (and especially their ability to source foreign funding), but not by the third or fourth category.â Latest Economy Return to results
Housing crash bottoming outâ, Moodyâs report says Housing crash bottoming outâ, Moodyâs report says But agency warns of substantial losses yet to be realised due to negative equity, hgih debt levels Those hoping for a significant recovery in prices may have to wait, with analysts noting a decline of around 50 per cent in house prices from their peak. Photograph: Aidan Crawley/Online News Irelandâs housing crash is finally showing signs of bottoming out, a new report from ratings agency Moodyâs has claimed. However, those expecting a significant recovery in prices may have to wait some time, with analysts noting a decline of around 50 per cent in house prices from their peak. House prices in Dublin have shown signs of recovery, with a recovery in house prices in Dublin and rising rents due to a shortage in supply, and improvements in Irelandâs macroeconomic environment boosting confidence among buyers. Cash investors have also been tempted back into the market by higher rents. âDespite these positive factors, the flat lending activities of Irish banks and the high outstanding household debt across the country will restrict the price recovery process,â the report said. âWhile prices will continue to slowly increase in Dublin, the temporary boost from cash buyers and supply restrictions will be insufficient to facilitate a significant recovery in prices.â Mortgage arrears are showing signs of peaking, but Moodyâs said there were still âsubstantial lossesâ to be realised, with the impact of negative equity also to be taken into account. âThere are a substantial number of Irish borrowers with unsustainable debt levels. High losses from these borrowers are inevitable either through repossession or, more likely for the majority of cases, debt forgiveness,â Modyâs said. âWe expect 90+ day and 360+ day arrears to stabilise over the coming quarters, following the already observed decreasing trend in our 60-90 days arrears during 2012. Despite the stabilising trends, a substantial number of borrowers have already defaulted.â Comments are closed for this article.
Icelandâs private sector running out of cash to repay debts Icelandâs private sector running out of cash to repay debts Total of â¬4.3 million non-krona debt owed by 2018, nationâs central bank says Icelandâs prime minister Sigmundur David Gunnlaugsson has described the countryâs foreign exchange shortfall as âa matter of huge concernâ. Photograph: Simon Dawson/Online News Icelandâs private sector is running out of cash to repay its foreign currency debt, according to the nationâs central bank. Non-krona debt owed by entities besides the Treasury and the central bank due through 2018 totals about 700 billion kronur (â¬4.3 billion), the bank said yesterday. The projected current account surpluses over the next five years arenât estimated to reach even half of that and will equal a shortfall of about 20 per cent of gross domestic product. The nation faces a ârepayment risk of foreign debt by private entities in the economy, who donât have access to foreign financial markets,â Sigridur Benediktsdottir, head of financial stability at the Reykjavik-based central bank, said yesterday in an interview. âWe view this as being exacerbated or made worse by the fact that our current account is actually declining.â Prime minister Sigmundur David Gunnlaugsson has said Icelandâs foreign exchange shortfall is âa matter of huge concernâ as he tries to scale back currency controls in place since 2008. The governmentâs biggest challenge is to allow capital to flow freely without triggering a krona sell-off that would cause Icelandâs foreign debt to spike and undermine the nationâs economic recovery.

Inpatient waiting lists grow by over 9,000 in year to September Inpatient waiting lists grow by over 9,000 in year to September Waiting lists at Temple Street Childrenâs Hospital, Dublin, more than doubled in the year to September. More than 9,000 more people were on hospital inpatient waiting lists in September than there were a year earlier, figures published by the National Treatment Purchase Fund show. A total of 9,282 more people were on waiting lists for medical treatments, surgical treatments, gastroscopies and colonoscopies in September than there were a year earlier, an increase of 19 per cent. The volume of patients waiting nine months or more for treatments (including gastroscopies and endoscopies) increased 10-fold in the year to September. Just 475 people were waiting over three months in September 2012 compared to the 4,514 people who were on waiting lists in September 2013. Hospital lists The number of patients who have been on waiting lists for more than a year is seven times the level it was a year earlier. In September 2012, just 134 patients were on waiting lists of 12 months or more; by September 2013 that figure had grown to 936 such patients. Meanwhile the number of children waiting nine months or more for treatment is four times that recorded in September last year having jumped from 60 to 241 cases. The overall volume of adults and children awaiting inpatient treatment in September stood at 58,883, down from a high of almost 60,000 patients who were on inpatient waiting lists in July. Analysis of waiting lists in 41 hospitals nationwide show that three in every five hospitals had at least 50 more patients on waiting lists in September last than they did in the same month in 2012. In terms of volume, Beaumont Hospital in Dublin and Waterford Regional Hospital saw the largest increase in the number of patients awaiting treatment with 1,508 and 1,456 extra people on waiting lists in September than there were a year earlier. Waterford is also one of four hospitals where waiting lists have more than doubled in the past year. In St Columcilleâs in Loughlinstown, Co Dublin, the number of people awaiting treatments trebled from 60 in September 2012 to 183 a year later. Two childrenâs hospitals - Temple Street and Our Ladyâs Hospital for Children, Crumlin - saw their waiting lists more than double in the same time period. The volume of children nationwide who are awaiting treatments excluding gastroscopies and colonoscopies has also grown substantially: 51 per cent more children were awaiting hospital treatments in September 2013 than there were a year previously. The figures show that the average waiting time for people awaiting inpatient medical or surgical treatment stood at 3.2 months in September compared to 2.8 months a year earlier. Outpatient waiting lists also increased slightly in the six months to September with 386,384 people on hospital outpatient lists in September compared to 384,632 in March. Deadlines for national targets which stipulate that no adult patient should wait for more than eight months for inpatient or day-case treatment or for no more than 12 months for outpatient treatments are scheduled to be implemented by the end of this year.

Iran jails blogger for 14 years Iran jails blogger for 14 years An Iranian weblogger has been jailed for 14 years on charges of spying and aiding foreign counter-revolutionaries. Arash Sigarchi was arrested last month after using his blog to criticise the arrest of other online journalists. Mr Sigarchi, who also edits a newspaper in northern Iran, was sentenced by a revolutionary court in the Gilan area. His sentence, criticised by human rights watchdog Reporters Without Borders, comes a day after an online "day of action" to secure his release. Iranian authorities have recently clamped down on the growing popularity of weblogs, restricting access to major blogging sites from within Iran. A second Iranian blogger, Motjaba Saminejad, who also used his website to report on bloggers' arrests, is still being held. A spokesman for Reporters Without Borders, which tracks press freedom across the globe, described Mr Sigarchi's sentence as "harsh" and called on Iranian President Mohammed Khatami to work to secure his immediate release. "The authorities are trying to make an example of him," the organisation said in a statement. "By handing down this harsh sentence against a weblogger, their aim is to dissuade journalists and internet-users from expressing themselves online or contacting foreign media." In the days before his arrest Mr Sigarchi gave interviews to the Online News Persian Service and the US-funded Radio Farda. Iranian authorities have arrested about 20 online journalists during the current crackdown. They accused Mr Sigarchi of a string of crimes against Iranian state, including espionage, insulting the founder of Iran's Islamic Republic, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomenei, and current Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Mr Sigarchi's lawyer labelled the revolutionary court "illegal and incompetent" and called for a retrial in a public court. Mr Sigarchi was sentenced one day after an online campaign highlighted his case in a day of action in defence of bloggers around the world. The Committee to Protect Bloggers designated 22 February 2005 as Free Mojtaba and Arash Day. Around 10,000 people visited the campaign's website during the day. About 12% of users were based in Iran, the campaign's director told the Online News News website. Curt Hopkins said Mr Sigarchi's sentence would not dent the resolve of bloggers joining the campaign to help highlight the case. "The eyes of 8 million bloggers are going to be more focused on Iran since Sigarchi's sentence, not less. "The mullahs won't be able to make a move without it be spread across the blogosphere."

Ireland was right to exit bailout without credit line, says Regling Ireland was right to exit bailout without credit line, says Regling Managing director of ESM says the countryâs bailout programme was âreal success storyâ Klaus Regling, who is managing director of the European Stability Mechanism (ESM), said the reaction of financial markets indicated it was the right decision. The head of the euro zoneâs rescue fund Klaus Regling says Ireland was ârightâ to exit the bailout programme without a precautionary credit line. Mr Regling, who is managing director of the European Stability Mechanism (ESM), said the reaction of financial markets indicated it was the right decision. He described Irelandâs bailout programme as a âreal success storyâ. However, he said that with the economy still suffering the effects of higher unemployment and lower real income, many may not view it as a success. âUnfortunately, this is normal in a crisis. Populations will only see later the benefits of all the adjustments.â Asked about the prospects of the ESM retroactively reimbursing the State for the costs of bailing out its banks, Mr Regling said the issue was under consideration by the euro group in the context of banking union. He said the ESM currently did not have âthe instrument of direct bank recapitalisationâ at its disposal. If the ESM treaty was changed to provide for retroactive recapitalisation then it might be possible for the fund to take an equity stake in the Irish banks, as has been suggested. Such a decision would not be made for at least a year, however, he said in an interview with RTÃ News. On whether the Irish banks may need further injections of the capital, Mr Regling said the sector had been scrutinised several times in the past and would be subject to further asset quality tests by the ECB next year. âWeâll see whether there are any capital gaps but I do not really expect that to be the case in Ireland.â He also ruled out the likelihood that Ireland would need any restructuring of its debts in the near or medium, primarily because debt-servicing costs remain very low.

Irish near top of OECD table for smoking and drinking Irish near top of OECD table for smoking and drinking Report finds Irish have greater propensity towards obesity than people in many other countries The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Developmentâs Health at a Glance 2013 report confirms the serious impact of the recession on health spending. Photograph: Fabrizio Bensch/Online News A major overview of health in Ireland published today shows that the Irish are still near the top of the international league table for smoking and drinking and have a greater propensity towards obesity than people in many other countries. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Developmentâs Health at a Glance 2013 report confirms the serious impact of the recession on health spending which had been growing in Ireland at 7 per cent annually during the boom years between 2000 and 2009. But it fell by 6.6 per cent annually between 2009 and 2011 on a per capita basis, with only Greece experiencing a sharper fall than Ireland. The report says that the fall in Irish spending reflects the substantial reforms undertaken, including cuts to cost of health care, such as wages and pharmaceuticals. Oecd health at a glance 2013 But the report also confirms the encouraging progress made in combating serious illnesses in the last two decades. Deaths due to cancer fell by 21 per cent, ischemic heart disease by 59 per cent and cerebrovascular disease by 54 per cent between 1990 and 2011. In all three instances, the rate of decline was greater than the OECD average. And life expectancy in Ireland has increased by a full four years since 2000 to reach 80.6 today, slightly more than the OECD average of 80.1. Ireland remains more than two years behind the table-topper, Switzerland, where life expectancy is 82.8 years. Drinking Ireland still ranks badly when it comes to smoking, drinking and obesity. Out of 40 countries surveyed, only the Russian Federation, Greece and Chile have a higher proportion of adult daily smokers than Irelandâs 29 per cent. And although this represents a decline of 12 percentage points since the year 2000, the decline is much smaller than in many other countries. However, this smoking data comes from 2007 and therefore may not give a completely accurate picture of current trends. Only five countries out of 40 drink more alcohol than Ireland annually on a per capita basis. Average consumption in Ireland has increased slightly in the last 20 years, compared to the significant reductions recorded in some high-consumption European countries, including France, Austria, Portugal and Spain. .

Irish property taxes likely to remain among lowest in OECD, study shows Irish property taxes likely to remain among lowest in OECD, study shows Think tank finds planning, not tax, is key to stable housing markets The Policy Exchange study finds that property taxes in the Republic amounted to 1.5 per cent of GDP in the 2011-2012 period. The comparable figure for the UK was 4.1 per cent â the highest in the OECD. Photograph: Bryan OâBrien Irish property taxes are among the lowest in the developed world, with this likely to remain the case even after the local property tax is fully applied, according to a new analysis from London-based think tank Policy Exchange . The study into the impact of taxation on housing supply and demand finds that property taxes in the Republic amounted to 1.5 per cent of GDP in the 2011- 2012 period. The comparable figure for the UK was 4.1 per cent â the highest in the OECD. In the US, property taxes equated to 3 per cent of output, while in Germany, it was 0.9 per cent. The OECD average for the period was 1.8 per cent, which is roughly around the level the ESRI expects to apply in Ireland when the local property tax comes into full application next year. Policy Exchange, an influential think-tank with strong conservative leanings, argues that the best way to deal with issues such as volatility in house prices and high rents, is to change the planning system rather than the taxation system. Its study â Taxing Issues? Reducing Housing Demand or Increasing Housing Supply â pushes for policymakers to commit to building 1.5 million new homes by 2020, including the construction of at least one âgarden cityâ. Such âattractively designedâ cities will âact as beacons for developmentâ, according to the research. Tax, the researchers argue, is not among the most crucial factors in housing affordability or price volatility. The study is underlined by the premise that home ownership is desirable; it argues that a reversal in UK home ownership levels from 70 per cent in 2002 to 64 per cent in 2011 is ânot acceptableâ. Property taxes as defined by the study include taxes on occupancy such as the LPT, taxes on transfers such as stamp duty, capital gains taxes and taxes on the increase of land value due to planning permission. It notes that while all the countries it considered apply property taxes, their methods of doing so differ widely. The study says that property taxes in the LPT vein, which create the single-biggest tax bill a consumer will receive in the year, tend to be hugely unpopular, despite being relatively low. âProperty taxes have a particularly negative effect on the âasset rich, cash poorâ,â the study finds. It also concludes that a belief that proportional tax on property will eliminate housing volatility and stabilise economies is âunsubstantiatedâ. In France, where property taxes equated to 3.7 per cent of GDP, the system includes annual property taxes and a 5 per cent transfer tax relating to changes in title. In Canada, where the comparable proportion was 3.5 per cent, property taxes are administered by local and provincial authorities and thus carry significant regional variations. There are no capital gains taxes on primary residences but non-residents pay 50 per cent as a withholding tax. Austria, where property taxes amounted to just 0.5 per cent of GDP, applies a uniform property tax ranging from 0.05 per cent to 0.2 per cent as well as a local property tax surcharge.

Jol joy at 'professional' Cup win Jol joy at 'professional' Cup win Tottenham manager Martin Jol acclaimed his players for their patience in their 3-0 FA Cup fifth-round victory over a determined Nottingham Forest side. "We had the initiative but it wasn't easy. It was a professional sort of performance," the Dutchman said. "Forest played with a lot of players behind the ball in the first half, but at 2-0 they were dead and buried." Looking ahead to the quarter-final, Jol said: "Newcastle have got a very good side and they are always difficult." However, he added that his side, who are four places above the Magpies in the Premiership, were "not afraid of anyone". Robbie Keane, skipper for the night and scorer of the crucial second goal, echoed his manager's sentiments on the last-eight match. "They're on a high, but we're confident and in the last few games we've played well and hopefully we can go there and get the win," he said. He conceded the win over Forest, which included goals from Noe Pamarot and Mido, was not pretty to watch. "It wasn't the best display but it's all about the result," the Irishman said. "We knew it was going to be difficult with the conditions. The pitch wasn't the best but we still tried to pass it. "We dug in and the gaffer said to us at half-time to keep being patient and that the goal will come." Forest manager Gary Megson conceded his team did not deserve anything after a poor performance. "If you play like we did and concede two goals from corners you're going to have an uphill battle against a very good team," he said. "If we defend in the Championship like we did we'll not get another point. "We were organised but I felt at times we thought the system would be enough but we didn't look like scoring."

Keane defiant over Vieira bust-up Keane defiant over Vieira bust-up Manchester United captain Roy Keane has insisted that he does not regret his tunnel bust-up with Arsenal's Patrick Vieira - and would do the same again. Keane clashed with midfield rival Vieira before United's 4-2 win in the fiery match at Highbury on 1 February. The Irishman stepped in to protect United defender Gary Neville, who rowed with Vieira before the match. "I'd had enough of Vieira's behaviour and I would do what I did again tomorrow if I had to," said Keane. Keane admitted that Neville may also have been at fault over the incident, which added further ill-feeling to an already-tense atmosphere. "It takes two to tango. Maybe Gary deserves to be chased up a tunnel every now and then - there would be a queue for him, probably," he added. "But you have to draw a line eventually." Keane said the trouble between Vieira and Neville was more serious than mere name-calling. "I'm usually first out in the tunnel but I had a problem with my shorts and I was maybe fourth or fifth out and by the time I got down I saw Vieira getting right into Gary Neville again," he said. "I mean physically as well now. I don't mean verbally." Comments are closed for this article.
Kewell waits as injury drags on Kewell waits as injury drags on Liverpool winger Harry Kewell is struggling to recover from his Achilles tendinitis problem and may not recover until March, claims his agent. Kewell, 26, had hoped to play against Fulham last weekend and to be ready for the Champions League tie against Bayer Leverkusen on 22 February. But Bernie Mandic said: "He's had scans which don't show anything substantial. "But despite his best efforts at the moment he simply can't shake off the discomfort and get back on the park." Mandic continued in the Sydney Morning Herald: "Harry's struggling a bit but the club are doing everything they can to get him right. "Harry was desperate to be fit for the Fulham game as part of his plan to play himself in for the Leverkusen match." Kewell has not played since December 19 and misses out on international duty this week, with Australia facing South Africa in Durban on Wednesday. Return to results
Lack of regular bed-time disrupts circadian rhythms, while sleep deprivation slows brain development Lack of regular bed-time disrupts circadian rhythms, while sleep deprivation slows brain development Children who switched to a more regular bed-time had clear improvements in their behaviour, according to the research published today in the medical journal Paediatrics. Late or irregular bed-times for children can induce symptoms similar to jet lag as well as behavioural problems and slower development, a British survey has found. Some 10,000 children born between September 2000 and January 2002 were checked by researchers from University College London (UCL) at ages three, five and seven. Children with late, or irregular bed-times displayed more hyperactivity and conduct problems and problems with peers as well as emotional difficulties the older they got. The results are particularly striking because the research team deliberately excluded from their study all children who were known to have ADHD, autism or Asperger syndrome. âDisruptions to sleep, especially if they occur at key times in development, could have important lifelong impacts on health,â said Yvonne Kelly of UCLâs Epidemiology & Public Health department. In the study one-tenth of seven-year-olds were in bed before 7.30pm; a quarter between then and 8pm; a third between 8pm and 8.30pm, one in seven between 8.30pm and 9pm, while 9 per cent were in bed after 9pm. Children who switched to a more regular bed-time had clear improvements in their behaviour, according to the research published today in the medical journal Paediatrics. Researchers believe that the lack of a regular bed-time disrupts the bodyâs circadian rhythms, while sleep deprivation slows brain development. âNot having fixed bed-times, accompanied by a constant sense of flux, induces a state of body and mind akin to jet lag and this matters for healthy development and daily functioning,â Prof Kelly said. Children with late or irregular bed-times are more likely to come from poorer homes, to skip breakfast, and to have a TV in their bedrooms, the researchers found. However, habits can be changed: âOur findings suggest the effects are reversible. For example, children who change from not having to having regular bedtimes show improvements.â However, the UCL researchers acknowledged the difficulties faced by parents: âRoutines can be difficult to maintain when [both] are working long, and potentially unsociable hours.â Return to results
Latest Opera browser gets vocal Latest Opera browser gets vocal Net browser Opera 8.0, due for official release at the end of next month, will be "the most accessible browser on the market", according to its authors. The latest version of the net browser can be controlled by voice command and will read pages aloud. The voice features, based on IBM technology, are currently only available in the Windows version. Opera can also magnify text by up to 10 times and users can create "style sheets", its developers say. This will enable them to view pages with colours and fonts that they prefer. But the browser does not yet work well with screen reader software often used by blind people, so its accessibility features are more likely to appeal to those with some residual vision. "Our mission was always to provide the best internet experience for everyone," said Opera spokeswoman, Berit Hanson. "So we would obviously not want to exclude disabled computer users." Another feature likely to appeal to people with low vision is the ability to make pages fit to the screen width, which eliminates the need for horizontal scrolling. The company points out that this will also appeal to anyone using Opera with a handheld device. The company says that features like voice activation are not solely aimed at visually impaired people. "Our idea was to take a first step in making human-computer interaction more natural," said Ms Hanson. "People are not always in a situation where they can access a keyboard, so this makes the web a more hands-free experience." Unlike commercially available voice recognition software, Opera does not have to be "trained" to recognise an individual voice. Around 50 voice commands are available and users will have to wear a headset which incorporates a microphone. The voice recognition function is currently only available in English. Opera is free to download but a paid-for version comes without an ad banner in the top right hand corner and with extra support. Opera began life as a research project - a spin-off from Norwegian telecoms company Telenor. Its browser is used by an estimated 10 million people on a variety of operating systems and a number of different platforms. Return to results
Man Utd through after Exeter test Man Utd through after Exeter test Manchester United avoided an FA Cup upset by edging past Exeter City in their third round replay. Cristiano Ronaldo scored the opener, slipping the ball between Paul Jones' legs after just nine minutes. United wasted a host of chances to make it safe as Jones made some great saves, but Wayne Rooney put the tie beyond doubt late on with a cool finish. Exeter had chances of their own, Sean Devine twice volleying wide and Andrew Taylor forcing Tim Howard to save. United boss Sir Alex Ferguson was taking few chances after their 0-0 draw in the first game and he handed starts to Paul Scholes and Ryan as well as Ronaldo and Rooney. Exeter began brightly with Devine and Steve Flack seeing plenty of the ball, but it did not take United long to assert their authority and the hosts soon found themselves a goal down. Scholes played a lovely pass in to Ronaldo on the left-hand side of the six-yard box and the Portuguese winger slid the ball between the legs of Jones to open the scoring. United sensed a chance to finish the tie as a contest early on and Ronaldo blazed over before Jones saved well from Scholes and then Rooney. The visitors' pressure by now was incessant and Rooney had another shot blocked while Ronaldo slammed well over the bar again from a good position. Just before the break Giggs had a golden chance to double the advantage, but the Welshman dragged a left-foot effort badly wide from 10 yards. In stoppage time Exeter created their best chance as Alex Jeannin swung in a cross from the left that Devine managed to flick goalwards, but the ball flew wide of Howard's goal. The Grecians came out after the break in determined fashion and Howard had to show safe hands to collect two searching crosses into the United box. Rooney looked like he might have sealed the result with a turn and shot but the ball stuck in the St James Park mud and Jones raced back to gather on the goalline. Moments later Devine had the chance to make himself a hero, but he could only volley Jeannin's brilliant cross wide of Howard's goal after being left unmarked six yards out. After Rooney had completely messed up a free-kick 20 yards out Taylor showed him how it should be done, his stunning drive from distance forcing a flying stop from Howard. The home crowd were baying for a goal and they did get the ball into the net only for Devine's low effort to be ruled out for an obvious offside. The persistent Rooney eventually rounded Jones with three minutes to go and slotted into an empty net to book a home tie with Middlesbrough in the fourth round.

McClaren hails Boro's Uefa spirit McClaren hails Boro's Uefa spirit Middlesbrough boss Steve McClaren has praised the way his side have got to grips with European football after the 2-0 Uefa Cup win against Lazio. Boro, who are playing in Europe for the first time in their 128-year history, are top of Group E with maximum points. "I think we have taken to Europe really well," said McClaren. "We got about Lazio, didn't let them settle or play. And in possession, we controlled it and looked threatening every time we went forward." Before the match, McClaren had said that a win over the Italian giants would put Boro firmly on the European footballing map. And after they did just that he said: "It was a perfect European night. For the team to give the fans a performance like that was the icing on the cake. "There have been many good performances but this was something special. "You can see that the experience we have in the squad is showing. To win in Europe you need to defend well, and we have done that because we have conceded only one goal in four games. "We can also score goals, and again that is something you can see from the performances we have had, so we have good balance. McClaren's only criticism of his side was that their dominance should have been resulted in more goals. "It should have been more convincing," said McClaren. "But I had watched Lazio in recent weeks and I saw them score a late equaliser against Inter Milan on Saturday so I knew we needed a second goal. "No matter what anybody says, Lazio are favourites to win this competition." Middlesbrough forward Boudewijn Zenden said he did not expect such a comfortable match after he scored both goals. "We didn't expect it to be that one-sided," said Zenden. "We did quite well in the first half, we pressured them and they didn't cope with that. "I think we played quite well and it was a very good game, especially in the first half." The Holland international said Boro are confident of progressing in the competition after winning their first two group games. "We've got a very good feeling, there is a good spirit, all the lads work hard for each other and it's a squad of friendly players, which I think you can see on the pitch," he added.

Measures set out to tackle cigarette company marketing targeting young people Measures set out to tackle cigarette company marketing targeting young people Minister for Health Dr James Reilly and Dr Haik Nikogosian (right), head of the Framework Convention of Tobacco Control at the World Health Organisation, at the launch today of the Tobacco Free Ireland policy document at Croke Park in Dublin. Photograph: Colin Keegan/Collins A plan to reduce the prevalence of smoking in Ireland to less than 5 per cent of the population by 2025 has been published by Minister for Health James Reilly . Tobacco Free Ireland recommends introducing legislation to prohibit smoking within the campuses of primary schools, secondary schools and child care facilities, as well as the promotion of tobacco free campuses for all third level institutions. The report sets out 60 recommendations aimed at cutting the rate of smoking. Currently 22 per cent of the adult population smokes. Dr Reilly said the measures would seek to protect the next generation from taking up âthis dreadful habit that kills one in two of those who use itâ. The document broadly sets out the Governmentâs aims but a detailed action plan with timelines has yet to be developed. The proposals, which have been criticised by smokersâ rights campaigners, would also see an annual excise duty increase on tobacco products applied over a continuous five year period. âRobust evidence exists demonstrating that higher tobacco taxes and prices are the single most effective measure to reduce overall tobacco use,â the report states. Also speaking at the event, World Health Organisation tobacco control chief Dr Haik Nikogosian said the plan was a âbold exampleâ of Irelandâs âstrong leadershipâ on tobacco measures over the past number of years. In particular Dr Nikogosian praised the aim of âdenormalisingâ smoking, that is to make it socially unacceptable. However Campaigners have criticised the proposal as âmorally wrongâ, saying it will stigmatise hundreds of thousands of adults around the country. âDenormalising tobacco will drive more and more people to the black market and the fringes of society,â said Forest Eireann spokesman John Mallon. Ireland will not be tobacco free by 2015, Mr Mallon said, adding that Dr Reillyâs âpersonal crusade to denormalise tobacco and stigmatise adults who choose to smoke has got to stop What next? Alcohol? Sugary drinks? Convenience food?â. The Irish Cancer society meanwhile welcomed the plan, especially its aim âto deal with the constant marketing assault on children and teensâ. But the organisation also questioned whether the Department of Health had the budget to follow through on the proposals. Itâs chief executive John McCormack called on Dr Reilly to seek an increased health budget to prevent this âambitious strategyâ becoming âdilutedâ. He added that the society looked forward to seeing how the Government will deal with poorer areas where women âare over twice as likely to smoke as better-off womenâ¦ because of the social conditions that affect their livesâ. Dr Reilly said he hoped to have the heads of Bill for anti-tobacco legislation prepared later this month. He warned that plans to introduce uniform cigarette packaging and other anti-smoking measures would draw intense lobbying from big tobacco companies. âThe full weight of the tobacco industry will now be turned on us,â he said. âThey employed 161 lobbyists to lobby MEPsâ¦ thatâs the level of resource they have and theyâre prepared to throw at this. Over the past year, industry lobbyists have secured meetings with a number of Government Ministers and officials, including Taoiseach Enda Kenny. Asked about the possibility of further such meetings Dr Reilly said it was âvery unlikelyâ. The Department of Health estimates at least 5,200 people die each year from diseases caused by tobacco use. This represents almost one in five of all deaths. Comments are closed for this article.
Medtronic: The centre is equipped with digital communication technology for âglobal networkingâ, alo... Medtronic: The centre is equipped with digital communication technology for âglobal networkingâ, along with three-dimensional printing for new ideas and space for training and education. A â¬7.7 million brainstorming centre to devise new treatments for cardiovascular and cardiac rhythm disease is due to be opened by EU Commissioner for Innovation, Research and Science, MÃ¡ire Geoghan-Quinn, at Medtronicâs premises in Galway today. Up to 500 doctors and other medical professionals are expected to spend time in the centre, working with engineers in collaboration, demonstration and hybrid laboratories where surgical procedures can be tried and tested. Global networking The centre is also equipped with digital communication technology for âglobal networkingâ, along with three-dimensional printing for new ideas and space for training and education The centre is the second of its kind in Europe for Medtronic , according to the multinationalâs general manager in Galway and global vascular operation vice-president Gerard Kilcommins . The company has similar centres in Japan, China, the US and Switzerland, but this is the first to be located at a major manufacturing centre, he said. It is testimony to the strategic importance of Galway and the level of expertise therein, he said. Medtronicâs 2,000-strong workforce in Galway includes some 100 dedicated research and development engineers who will work with cardiac specialists like Dr Faisal Sharif , consultant cardiologist at University Hospital Galway and senior lecturer in regenerative medicine at NUI Galway . Dr Sharif said the catheterisation/vascular laboratory in the centre includes a virtual operating room where procedures can be carried out on human anatomical models. âThe fact that it is a global centre means that it will attract a lot of international experts and speakers,â he said. Medtronic, which has headquarters in Minneapolis, US, has built its reputation on manufacturing stents, pacemakers, defibrillators and different types of catheters, he said. âWe in the health service are constantly striving to improve healthcare and to develop technologies which will alleviate chronic illnesses, and this new facility will be very beneficial.â Innovation Medtronic chairman and chief executive officer Omar Ishrak said, âInnovation is the lifeblood of our company and it is through close collaboration with physicians that many of our innovations are developed.â IDA chief executive Barry OâLeary said the centre was very significant in âpositioning Ireland internationally as a centre of excellence for innovation, research and development in the medical technology space.â Return to results
Microsoft debuts security tools Microsoft debuts security tools Microsoft is releasing tools that clean up PCs harbouring viruses and spyware. The virus-fighting program will be updated monthly and is a precursor to Microsoft releasing dedicated anti-virus software. Also being released is a software utility that will help users find and remove any spyware on their home computer. Although initially free it is thought that soon Microsoft will be charging users for the anti-spyware tool. The anti-spyware tool is available now and the anti-virus utility is expected to be available later this month. Microsoft's Windows operating system has long been a favourite of people who write computer viruses because it is so ubiquitous and has many loopholes that can be exploited. It has proved such a tempting target that there are now thought to be more than 100,000 viruses and other malicious programs in existence. Latest research suggests that new variants of viruses are being cranked out at a rate of up to 200 per week. Spyware is surreptitious software that sneaks on to home computers, often without users' knowledge. In its most benign form it just bombards users with pop-up adverts or hijacks web browser settings. The most malicious forms steal confidential information or log every keystroke that users make. Surveys have shown that most PCs are infested with spyware. Research by technology firms Earthlink and Webroot revealed that 90% of Windows machine have the malicious software on board and, on average, each one harbours 28 separate spyware programs. Before now Microsoft has left the market for PC security software to specialist firms such as Symantec, McAfee, Trend Micro and many others. It said that its virus cleaning program would not stop machines being infected nor remove the need for other anti-virus programs. On spyware freely available programs such as Ad-Aware and Spybot have become widely used by people keen to keep the latest variants at bay. Microsoft's two security tools have emerged as a result of acquisitions the company has made over the last two years. In 2003 it bought Romanian firm GeCAD Software to get hold of its anti-virus technology. In December 2004 it bought New York-based anti-spyware firm Giant Company Software. Last year Microsoft also released the SP2 upgrade for Windows XP that closed many security loopholes in the software and made it easier for people to manage their anti-virus and firewall programs.

Minister says Irish banks are âwell-capitalisedâ and have been âwell-scrutinisedâ Minister says Irish banks are âwell-capitalisedâ and have been âwell-scrutinisedâ Executive board member of the European Central Bank (ECB), JÃ¶rg Asmussen said Irelandâs bailout has been a âclear success story.â Photograph: Ralph Orlowski/Online News ECB executive board member Jorg Asmussen has said there are âpending risksâ for Ireland as it prepares to exit the EU-IMF bailout programme. Speaking ahead of a meeting of euro zone finance ministers in Luxembourg the senior ECB figure said it will be up to Ireland to decide whether to request a precautionary credit line to help its exit from the programme. However, there were pending risks, he said, specifically in the banking sector and in terms of its deficit, which is still âvery highâ compared to the European average. He said while Ireland, as well as the other programme countries, will be discussed at this eveningâs meeting, no decisions will be taken. The Government has indicated that it may not need to use a precautionary credit line when it exits the bailout at the end of the year. However, a decision on whether Ireland needs support will take into account the results of balance sheet assessments of Irish banks that are currently being undertaken by the Irish Central Bank and will be submitted to euro zone authorities by the end of the month. Addressing reporters on his way into the meeting, Minister for European Affairs Paschal Donohue said that Irish banks were âwell-capitalisedâ and âwell-scrutinisedâ. âThe government is participating in a very credible process in relation to this,â the Minister said. âWe have our asset quality review which is underway and will be concluding later on in the year to look at the quality of assets on the balance sheets of our banks. We will then be participating in a stress test in proximity to the European wide process next year. Our banks are well capitalised, theyâve been well-scrutinised. We will be participating fully in the process that is underway.â The Minister said that discussions on a bailout exit strategy would commence after tomorrowâs budget. âWhen that is complete the Government will then be engaging with the Troika to evaluate all options in relation to exiting our bailout programme,â stressing that the strategy was to make a âsustainable exitâ from the programme. While euro zone authorities are believed to be in favour, in principle, of Ireland exiting the bailout without a precautionary credit line, the results of ongoing balance sheet assessments of Bank of Ireland, AIB and Permanent TSB will be taken into account when negotiations on an exit strategy intensify later this month. Dublin is expected to argue the State is well-funded to deal with any potential capital issues from its own resources. It wants any negotiations on a precautionary credit line to be decoupled from the Irish bank stress tests, and is expected to reiterate that the review of the bank loans should run in line with the Europe-wide stress tests. This eveningâs meeting of euro zone finance ministers will discuss possible âbackstopâ options that are available to countries, ahead of next yearâs euro-wide banking stress tests. With EU finance ministers still locked in discussions about banking union, concerns are growing about how countries will deal with any capital holes revealed by stress tests. European finance ministersâ plans for a common resolution and recovery directive will not be implemented until 2015 at the earliest, while the European Commissionâs proposal for a single resolution mechanism, with a common fund to deal with resolved banks, is meeting staunch resistance from Germany.

Mobile music challenges 'iPod age' Mobile music challenges 'iPod age' Nokia and Microsoft have agreed a deal to work on delivery of music to handsets, while Sony Ericsson has unveiled its phone Walkman and Motorola is working on an iTunes phone. Can mobile phones replace the MP3 player in your pocket? The music download market has been growing steadily since record firms embraced digital distribution. Ease of use, relative low price and increased access to broadband has helped drive the phenomenal growth of MP3 players. Full-length music downloads on mobile phones have not taken off so quickly - held back by technical challenges as well as issues over music availability. But the mobile music industry is confident that the days of dedicated MP3 players are numbered. Gilles Babinet, chief executive of mobile music firm Musiwave, said: "Music downloads on mobiles have the potential to be the biggest-ever medium for music." Musiwave provides downloading infrastructure for the mobile phone market and Mr Babinet said the industry was enjoying "definite momentum." But there are hurdles to overcome. Mobile phones offer limited storage for music - certainly nothing to rival Apple's 60GB iPod. But the first mobile phones with hard disk players will be on the market soon and the current generation of mobiles using flash technology can store up to one gigabyte of music - enough for 250 songs. "We are working in the hard disk area and we will be bringing out exciting devices," Jonas Guest, vice president for entertainment at Nokia, told the Online News News website. But will mobiles become mere storage devices? "One of the problems we could have is that mobiles are used just for storage and playback while PCs are used for downloading," said Mr Babinet "We don't want people to cast aside their PCs - we want mobile users to hook up into the existing ecosystems," explained Mr Guest. "You must enable people to transfer music from a PC to a handset and vice versa." One of the key elements of the Nokia and Microsoft deal is the agreed ability to transfer songs between a handset and a PC. Microsoft will adopt open standards allowing music to cross boundaries for the first time. Songs can be downloaded on PC or mobile and transferred between the platforms. "The line between online and wireless is going to blur," predicted Ted Cohen, senior vice president of digital development and distribution at EMI. He said: "The market is more regional in its maturity. In Asia it is beyond belief. "The majority of our digital revenues in Asia comes from mobiles. In North America it is fixed line while there is equilibrium in Europe." EMI currently offers its entire 200,000 download catalogue for use by both by PCs and mobile phones. Mr Cohen said: "It's going to be just as important to connect through 3G or wireless as it is through your PC. "We want music to be a continuum." The seamless experience of mobiles and PC downloads is approaching, he predicted. Mr Babinet said the mobile phone had a number of advantages over PCs which would see it become the focus for music downloading in the future. "Getting music from your PC onto a device is not an easy experience. You have to switch the PC on, load the operating system, load the program, buy the music, download the music, and then transfer the music. "All of these steps can be done in one step on a mobile phone." He said the mobile phone's billing system would make it easier for teenagers to embrace downloads, because pre-paid cards were already accepted by the age group. "Certainly, we have a problem with battery, memory and bandwidth. But it's not about the current status. It's about the potential. "You will have all of your music on your mobile." All three men said that the social interaction of mobile music would drive the market. Mr Cohen said: "I can send you the song and it is either billed to me or I send it to you and if you listen to it and want to keep, it is billed to you. "It's a social phenomenon." Mr Babinet said: "Today you use radio and TV to discover music. Tomorrow you will discover and consume music via one device - the mobile." Comments are closed for this article.
Napster offers rented music to go Napster offers rented music to go Music downloading, for those that have rejected the free peer to peer services, can be a costly business. The cost of paying even as little as 70p per track can add up, particularly for those people who own one of the new generation of players that can store thousands of songs. Paying per track for music is becoming as outmoded as paying per minute for internet access and alternative monthly or yearly subscription models are springing up as a more convenient, and ultimately cheaper way of owning music. "Music fans are moving away from buying the traditional bundled package of a dozen or more songs that we used to call an album to newer ways that fit their lifestyle; either single tracks or subscriptions services," said Paul Myers, chief executive of Wippit, a UK-based music download service. While iTunes is doing good business with its sales of individual tracks to iPod owners, others are questioning whether the concept of owning music is even valid in the digital age. Napster is due to launch a new rental subscription service - dubbed Napster to Go in the UK in the next few months. The service can be used on players that support Microsoft Windows latest Digital Rights Management technology known as Janus. This includes players made by Samsung, Rio and Creative. Currently on offer in beta-version in the US, the service costs $15 per month for unlimited downloads. The technology ensures that music downloaded to the player only remains playable while the user subscribes to the service. Users need to update their license on a monthly basis or the tunes will no longer play. This has outraged some digital music lovers, especially as Napster already offers a cheaper service for downloading music to the PC. Napster claims the higher price is a result of record labels charging more for the to-go service and says it also offers "greater value" for customers. Mr Myers is not convinced a rental model will work for consumers. "We've been offering our unlimited music subscription service for more than three years now and our customers know what they want. Format interoperability, excellent value and the reassurance that music purchased from Wippit is theirs to keep and enjoy on whatever device they choose," he said. "Who wants to download a track that won't play next month if you decide to unsubscribe to the service or change portable player for an iPod or the latest mobile phone?" Wippit offers a download subscription service for Â£4.99 per month or Â£50 per year. It has a catalogue of around 60,000 songs. Comments are closed for this article.
Nintendo handheld given Euro date Nintendo handheld given Euro date Nintendo's new handheld console, the DS, will launch in Europe on 11 March, the company has announced. The portable games machine, which features touch-screen control, will retail for Â£99 in the UK (149 euros). Nintendo said 15 games would be available in the UK at launch, with prices ranging from Â£19 to Â£29. More than 2.8 million DS consoles have been sold since it first appeared in the US and Japan at the end of 2004. Rival Sony has said it will launch its first handheld console, the PSP, in the US and Europe before the end of March. The PSP is expected to compete for a large part of the same handheld market, despite Sony's assertion that the machines are aimed at different consumers. The 15 games available on the European launch date will include Nintendo's Super Mario 64 DS, as well as titles from third-party developers such as Ubisoft's Rayman DS. More than 120 games are in development for the new console, Nintendo has said. The DS is backwards compatible with the Game Boy Advance, allowing the earlier machine's back catalogue of 700 games to be played. Additionally, a short-range wireless link for multiplayer gaming is built in to the DS, with a "download play" option which allows a group to play against each other, even if just one person owns a copy. Other features include a short-range messaging application called Pictochat, and a built-in microphone which is used in Sega's launch title Project Rub. Nintendo has also announced a media adapter, which will allow the console to play music and video on the move. The launch price of Â£99 (149 euros) compares favourably with the US price of $149, according to John Houlihan, editor of the Computerandvideogames.com magazine. "It's a very, very competitive price point. There are some innovative features, and Nintendo has created quite a buzz," he says. "However, the line-up of games could have been stronger. Everyone wanted to see the eight-player Mario Kart DS, for example." Mr Houlihan believes that there is likely to be an audience for both the Nintendo DS and Sony's new PSP, with the former aimed largely at a younger audience and the latter expected to be marketed as a multimedia device. "The PSP is a sexy bit of kit, but Sony's attitude to the PSP has been very understated in Europe, so far," Mr Houlihan said. The worldwide handheld software market had an estimated worth of $2.6bn at the end of 2004, according to industry analysts Screen Digest. In the past, games consoles and handhelds have generally launched much later in Europe than in other parts of the world. However Nintendo president Satoru Iwata said the company was "pleased to have offered such a short period of time between the US and European launch". "Europe is an extremely important market for Nintendo," Mr Iwata added. Nintendo raised its sales targets for the DS console last December after selling a million in the US and Japan in just a few weeks. Return to results
Not everyone is buying the Irish bailout success story Not everyone is buying the Irish bailout success story Given our indebtedness and the state of our banks, sentiment towards Ireland could change quickly in the post-bailout world Last weekâs meeting of EU finance ministers: while the Government views the muted market response to the backstop announcement as a thumbs up to its âgo it aloneâ stratagem many observers are dubious about Irelandâs prospects to go it alone post-bailout.photograph: francois lenoir/reuters Barring an accident Ireland looks set to exit the bailout on a tailwind of positive sentiment. The Government has hit every fiscal target asked of it, bond yields are at record lows, and while concerns persist about the strength of recovery elsewhere, growth forecasts for Ireland are positive across the board. To cushion its return to the markets, the NTMA has built up a war chest of some â¬21 billion in reserves â enough to last us until the first quarter of 2015 they say. The muted market response to the backstop announcement will also be viewed by Government as further proof of its convalescence, and a thumbs up to its âgo it aloneâ stratagem. However, if the crash has taught us anything, it is how quickly such sentiment can evaporate. For Jeremy OâFriel, managing director of Belmont Investments â a New York-based hedge fund â there are still too many âwhat ifsâ in the equation. âWhat if the banks need more money? What if tapering [a cooling of the Fed bond-buying programme] starts and interest rates rise as the global economy recovers? What if Greece falls over?â OâFriel bases his analysis on debt sustainability metrics that suggest Ireland â with a public sector debt of 125 per cent of GDP and rising â will need more than a modest growth rate just to cover the interest payments. âSo even with the following â European support, IMF support, record low global rates due to Quantitative Easing (QE), political stability â even with all of that, we are only just below the bubble. âYes, there is a possibility of growth, but just feed the numbers into the parameters and you will see that we need something extraordinary, to improve the tax take to a point where the situation starts to look safe again.â Several European-based investors said the flood of central bank money was âaiding risk appetiteâ across the euro zone and prompting a surge in bond issuance from the periphery. Irish companies are taking advantage of what one observer labelled a âyield grabâ, raising over â¬6 billion in debt in the year to date. On Wednesday, AIB comfortably raised â¬500 million in its first âunguaranteedâ bond issuance in nearly five years. Nonethless, there have been widespread reports of some investors in Irish bonds jumping ship and taking profits ahead of the bailout exit. âProfit taking is likely the biggest motivating factor in these reported sales,â said Niall Quinn, head of international business at Eaton Vance, a $270 billion US money manager. âIt may also be that, on a risk/reward basis, these investors believe that there are more attractive investment opportunities in other markets.â Lee Cumbes , head of sovereign origination at Barclays , said, however, this was part of a natural maturing of the investor base whereby the initial wave of âcredit investorsâ is replaced by more traditional ârate investorsâ. On the outlook for Irish bond yields, he said: âI donât think theyâll come back as peripheral yields for a variety of reasons, but mainly because of the countryâs positive growth outlook and its moderate borrowing requirements.â He reckons Irish bonds will form part of a semi-core in the future, rather than on the periphery of the market.

Photograph: Brian Lawless/PA Wire The number of people admitted to hospital for alcohol dependency has dropped over recent years, doctors have revealed. Data from St Vincentâs Hospital in Dublin showed that 14,239 patients were treated in 2011 â a drop of 16 per cent from the year before. Professor Aiden McCormick said: âThe surprising thing is that this reduction has not happened sooner.â The decline follows an earlier reduction in emergency admissions in 2008. But it also comes on the back of a 335 per cent increase in admissions of patients with alcoholic liver disease between 1995 and 2010. Despite the decline in patients with alcohol dependency issues, doctors from the Mater hospital in the capital revealed a shortage in detox services available. Their study found that 80 per cent of doctors cannot access out-patient detox services for their patients and only 5 per cent were able to refer patients directly to psychological services. They said the data suggested there had been an over-reliance on voluntary organisations, such as Alcoholics Anonymous, for support to patients. Dr Audrey Dillon, research registrar at the Mater hospitalâs liver unit, said the difficulty in accessing psychological support contravened recommendations from the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland and other international groups. âThese services are necessary and would be considered the gold standard approach to the management of alcohol dependence,â Dr Dillon said. âThe overall cost implications of providing early access to the psychological therapy needed to modify behaviour would be outweighed by lower rates of alcohol-related harm, psychiatric problems, alcohol-related cancers and liver disease, and would ultimately lead to reduced alcohol-related health service costs.â The research from St Vincentâs and the Mater will be presented today at the winter meeting of the Irish Society of Gastroenterology in Kerry.

Online games play with politics Online games play with politics After bubbling under for some time, online games broke through onto the political arena in 2004. The US presidential election provided a showcase for many, aimed at talking directly to a generation that has grown up with joysticks and gamepads. Experts say this reflects how video games are becoming a mainstream part of culture and society. The first official political campaign game was technically launched during the last week of 2003: the Iowa Game, commissioned by the Democrat hopeful Howard Dean. More than 20 followed suit, including Frontrunner, eLections, President Forever and The Political Machine, which allowed players to run an entire presidential campaign, including having to cope with the media. Others helped raise the stakes during the Bush/Kerry contest by highlighting a candidate's virtues or his vices. The phenomenon has astonished the forefathers of political games, a handful of multi-discipline games enthusiasts keen to push frontiers. "When I started researching political games at the university, about five years ago, I thought it was going to be something that would take decades to happen," said Gonzalo Frasca, computer games specialist at the Information Technology University of Copenhagen. "I must admit that I was the first person to be surprised at seeing how fast they have evolved," added the Uruguayan-born researcher, who has so far created games for two political campaigns. Many artists and designers are experimenting with this form of gaming with an agenda in projects such as newsgaming.com. The aim is to comment on international news events via games. The ability of games to simulate reality makes them a powerful modelling tool to interact with actual situations in an original way. "Video games generate strong reactions mainly because they are new, but also because our culture needs to learn how to deal with simulation," Mr Frasca told the Online News News website. This was the case with the one he created for a political party in Uruguay, Cambiemos, an online puzzle game that offered a view on how the country's problems could be solved by working together. "It's up to us to explore what we can learn from ourselves through play and video games." Ultimately, Dr Frasca sees games as a small laboratory where we can play with our hopes, fears and beliefs. "Children learn a lot about the world through play. There is no reason why we adults should stop doing it as we grow up." But experts estimate it will still take at least about a decade until this new breed of video gaming communication become a common tool for political campaigns. This is hardly surprising, compared to other forms of mass media like the worldwide web. Only a few years ago, most politicians did not have a webpage, while now it is almost a must-have. Dr Frasca said: "Political campaigns will continue to experiment with video games. They represent a new tool of communication that can reach a younger audience in a language that can clearly speak to them." "It will not replace other forms of political propaganda, but it will integrate itself on to the media ecology of political campaigns." Comments are closed for this article.
Pennant guilty of wasting talent Pennant guilty of wasting talent Had Jermaine Pennant fulfilled the enormous potential that convinced Arsenal to pay Notts County Â£2m for the 16-year-old in January 1999, his fall from grace might have registered more than a blip on football's Richter Scale. But the Nottingham-born winger has repeatedly failed to grasp the opportunities presented to him by the Gunners, so much so that it is inevitable the club will release him when his contract expires in the summer. Pennant effectively blew his chances of ever making it at Highbury by upsetting the club's normally unflappable manager Arsene Wenger, who finally lost patience with the player's poor timekeeping. Now, after being caught drink-driving for the second time in 12 months, Pennant no longer has to worry about whether he makes it to training on schedule. Aged 22, there is no doubt Pennant still has time to resurrect his career when he is freed this summer. Compare his fate with that of West Bromwich Albion striker Lee Hughes, who will be 34 by the time he has served his six-year sentence for causing death by dangerous driving. Pennant may even find himself back at Birmingham City, the club who handed him a lifeline when it became clear his Arsenal career was well and truly over. Blues manager Steve Bruce apparently saw enough in Pennant in the month he was at St Andrews to issue an empassioned plea for leniency ahead of sentencing, claiming he had finally turned the corner. "We've got him in a flat up here, we've got him away from the distractions of London, we've had someone with him for the best part of every day and .. done everything we can to try and put him on the straight and narrow," Bruce said ahead of Tuesday's court hearing. "He's done wrong and we've all done stupid things when we were younger and he admits that now. "You can't describe how stupid he has been but as long as he learns from it, I don't think there is going to be any benefit from sending him to prison." The judge apparently disagreed. Birmingham chairman David Gold said last month he would still be keen to sign Pennant even if the 22-year-old got a custodial sentence. But wherever Pennant ends up, talk will not be of his potential but whether he can steer clear of trouble off the pitch. Pennant has insisted in the past that he does not have an attitude problem. But this is a player who, as well as failing to turn up to training on time, has been: - Caught driving under the influence of alcohol twice; - Sent home by England after breaking a team curfew before a Euro Under-21 qualifier against Turkey in April 2003; - And been sent off in an U-21 friendly against Croatia in August of the same year for punching an opponent, although he claimed he was racially abused. Pennant's supporters may claim that too much fame and money at an early age are in some way to blame for his lapses in judgment. During his sentencing, his lawyer Barry Warburton told the court Pennant had never been in trouble during a difficult childhood in Nottingham, despite growing up on "one of the worst estates" in the city. He had only "intermittent" schooling and when he arrived at Arsenal "had very little reading and writing skills". "They in fact educated him," said Mr Warburton, who had claimed imprisonment "could completely destroy his career". But his childhood aside, Pennant knows he has been treading a fine line for some time. He has publicly stated on numerous occasions that he is grateful to Wenger and Arsenal for their faith in him. Yet he continues to spurn the chances that are given him. It all looked so good for Pennant when he scored a 10-minute hat-trick against Southampton on his full league debut for Arsenal in May 2003. Yet his wayward behaviour coupled with his inability to displace Robert Pires from the Gunners first team mean he is a talent quickly disappearing over the footballing horizon. Whether he vanishes completely is down to him. As Professional Footballers' Association chief executive Gordon Taylor puts it, Pennant is now at a "crossroads in his career". "I hope he has got the strength to come out of this and be better for it," said Taylor. Return to results
Poll explains free-kick decision Poll explains free-kick decision Referee Graham Poll said he applied the laws of the game in allowing Arsenal striker Thierry Henry's free-kick in Sunday's 2-2 draw with Chelsea. Keeper Petr Cech was organising his defensive wall when Henry's quick free-kick flew in, which angered Chelsea. "The whistle doesn't need to be blown. I asked Henry 'do you want a wall?'. He said 'can I take it please?' He was very polite. I said 'yes'," said Poll. "I deal with the laws of the game. I deal with fact." Poll added: "I gave the signal for him to take it. That's what he did. "The same thing happened when I refereed Chelsea against West Ham in an FA Cup replay two years ago - when Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink scored - and I don't remember them complaining about that." Henry explained why he paused before striking the ball for the goal, which put Arsenal 2-1 ahead. Henry told Online News Radio Five Live: "The ref asked me if I wanted 10 yards or if I wanted to take it straight away and I said that I wanted to take it straight away. He said to me, 'go'. "It looks a bit strange because I took my time. I was waiting for Eidur Gudjohnsen to move and give me some space. "At one point, he turned and that's when I tried it." Former referees' chief Philip Don backed Poll's decision to allow the strike. "The advantage should go to the non-offending team. On this occasion it was Arsenal," Don told Online News Radio Five Live. "Referees have been told to ask the player 'do you want to take the quick free-kick?' or 'do you want me to get the wall back 9.15 metres?' "If they say 'quick', the referee tends to move away and allow the kick." Don was head of the referees for the Premier League and revealed all clubs were informed of free-kick options. "We spoke to all the Premier League clubs as well as all the Football League clubs in the summer of 2003 explaining what the situation was," he added "We gave them the option of either the quick free-kick or the 'ceremonial' free-kick. Players and clubs were aware of what referees were doing." Comments are closed for this article.
Prescription of Lariam to Defence Forces to continue despite revised safety information Prescription of Lariam to Defence Forces to continue despite revised safety information Lariam, chemical name mefloquine, has been issued to Irish soldiers to combat malaria since 2001 when it was prescribed for those going to Eritrea. A report on the use of controversial anti-malarial drug Lariam received by Minister for Defence Alan Shatter is âlegally privilegedâ and will not be published, the Department of Defence has said. Administration of the drug to Defence Forces personnel travelling to malarial countries will continue. This is despite revised safety information from manufacturer Roche that the drug can cause serious neuropsychiatric disorders. The disorders now listed by Roche as possible side effects include insomnia, anxiety and depression. The company also says hallucinations, psychosis, suicide, suicidal thoughts and self-endangering behaviour have been reported. It says that adverse reactions could persist up to several months after discontinuation. They were required to take the drug under supervision and were warned not to take any other anti-malarial medicine as âonly Lariam is effective in Chadâ, though other drugs, such as atovaquone-proguanil (Malarone) and orartemether-lumefantrine (Coartem), are used by other countries, including the US. Alternative anti-malarial drugs found in the possession of any soldier would be considered contraband and soldiers would face disciplinary action if found with them, soldiers were told. Blood test If they did become sick with malaria, a blood test would reveal âthe amount of Lariam in your systemâ, soldiers were warned. They were also required to report any other soldier to an officer if they were aware he or she was not taking the drug. Lariam, chemical name mefloquine, has been issued to Irish soldiers to combat malaria since 2001 when it was prescribed for those going to Eritrea . Since then, it has been the main drug used for Defence Forces missions to countries with malaria. While it was also used widely in the US military, the Pentagon dropped it as the drug of choice in 2009 after concerns about side effects in some soldiers. Advice given to Irish personnel going to Chad included that if they developed intolerable side effects, alternative medication could be prescribed, âbut in the event of this happening, you will be considered unfit for future missions requiring Lariamâ. Additional measures were taken by the Defence Forces in 2004 to ensure personnel travelling to malarial countries took their medication. These included that all personnel be ordered to take their medication, to be administered once a week, unless ordered to cease under medical advice and those who failed to do so could be repatriated. Taking of the drug was also to be supervised. Some serving and former members of the Defence Forces have since begun legal action against the State complaining of side effects including depression and suicidal ideation. The report of the Working Group on Malaria Chemoprophylaxis, set up in 2009, examined the use of Lariam. The group reported to Mr Shatter over the summer. Aware of side effects In a statement the department said the report was âproduced in the context of current and potential litigation and is legally privilegedâ and would not be published. The Defence Forces were aware of the reported side effects âattaching to all anti-malarial medicationsâ, including the latest patient safety information issued by Roche for Lariam, the statement noted. And âsignificant precautionsâ are being taken by the Medical Corps to assess the suitability of members to take Lariam or any other anti-malarial drugs. âLariam continues to be authorised by the Irish Medicines Board , the statutory body that regulates medicines available in Ireland , and the Defence Forces comply fully with IMB guidelines on the prescribing of all medicines including Lariam,â it said.

Property tax payments surpass â¬174m on 1.58 million properties Property tax payments surpass â¬174m on 1.58 million properties Revenue is on track to achieve its â¬250 million budget target for collection of the Local Property Tax, with â¬174,919,483 collected, and a further â¬60 million committed in phased payments. Photograph: Joe St Leger The Revenue Commissioners has started to pursue property-owners who did not pay the property tax before the end-of-May deadline, having so far collected almost â¬175 million in an 89 per cent compliance rate. Revenue is on track to achieve its â¬250 million budget target for collection of the tax, with â¬174,919,483 collected, and a further â¬60 million committed in phased payments. Revenue has warned it will deduct the remaining â¬15 million due in property tax payments directly from the salary, pension or bank accounts of the 11 per cent of homeowners who have not yet co-operated with the taxation authority. Figures published by Revenue yesterday show the tax has been paid on 1.58 million of the 1.96 million properties in the State, with that figure rising to 1.74 million when properties for which local authorities or housing associations have responsibility are included. The yield from the tax is estimated to be â¬250 million in 2013 (half-year charge) and â¬500 million for the full year in 2014. In a regional analysis of the payments to date, Donegal has the lowest compliance rate at 84 per cent, with Tipperary and DÃºn Laoghaire-Rathdown sharing the highest compliance rate at 92 per cent. Compliance rate Galway county, Laois, Leitrim, Offaly, Waterford county, Westmeath, Wicklow, and Wexford all have a compliance rate of 90 per cent. Almost â¬30 million has been collected in Dublin city, while DÃºn Laoghaire-Rathdown homeowners have paid â¬17.9 million, with â¬12.7 million collected in Fingal. Some â¬839,147 has been collected in Leitrim and â¬819,618 in Longford. Revenue said it had already begun writing to property owners who are in employment or have an occupational pension but who have not met their LPT obligations. They will have seven days from the date of the letter to file their return online to prevent Revenue issuing instructions to their employer to deduct the LPT estimate from their wages or pension. Self-employed property owners who have not complied with their LPT obligations will not qualify for a tax clearance cert. Revenue said employers will be instructed to deduct LPT in equal instalments from the employeeâs salary. It also said rising property prices would not affect the tax until 2016 with initial property valuations valid up to then. Exempt Property prices in June registered their highest monthly increase since the housing market crashed more than half a decade ago, according to the latest data from the Central Statistics Office . Residential prices throughout the country rose by 1.2 per cent compared to May, and showed a similar rise year on year. New and previously unused properties as well as second-hand properties purchased by first-time buyers between now and the end of 2016 will be exempt from the tax. Return to results
Proposed changes for pregnant women should be stopped, they say Proposed changes for pregnant women should be stopped, they say Prime Minister David Cameron speaking at the Invest Northern Ireland investment conference at the Titanic Belfast, yesterday. Photograph: Niall Carson/PA. European Union rules, particularly those applying to small companies, must be reduced, or abolished, some of Britainâs most influential business leaders will today tell UK prime minister David Cameron . EU legislation strengthening the rights of women during and after pregnancy âshould be withdrawnâ while mandatory rules governing the posting of sub-contracted workers between EU states should not be introduced, says the group which includes Marc Bolland , Marks and Spencerâs chief executive, and Paul Walsh , former chief executive of Diageo . New employment laws should be rare, while small businesses should be automatically exempted, unless a good reason exists. Meanwhile, one-man gardening firms, carpenters and other small contractors should not face registration fees for transporting non-toxic waste. Small businesses in non-risky occupations should not have to keep written health and safety risk assessments â a change which would save â¬2.7 billion a year.

Reilly says cost of claims almost â¬2 billion Reilly says cost of claims almost â¬2 billion Dr James Reilly: âClearly, increases of this magnitude are not sustainable.â Hospital consultants shared about â¬400 million in fees for private practice work last year, new figures set out by the Minister for Health James Reilly suggest. Dr Reilly said that data provided to the Department of Health by the regulator for the private health insurance sector, the Health Insurance Authority , showed almost â¬2 billion was paid in claims by private health insurers in 2012. âSome 46 per cent was paid to private hospitals, 27 per cent to public hospitals, 20 per cent to consultants and 7 per cent mainly for outpatient benefits.â Private hospitals The figures given by the Minister to the DÃ¡il last week would indicate private hospitals collectively received about â¬920 million in fees from the health insurance industry, while public hospitals received about â¬540 million. The figures would also suggest hospital consultants with private practice rights collectively received about â¬400 million in fees from health insurers last year. There are around 2,500 consultants working in public hospitals but not all are permitted to treat fee-paying patients. The Stateâs largest health insurer, the VHI, said last year that it had paid out an average of â¬86,000 per hospital consultant for treating private patients last year. Consultants would receive fees from other health insurers for treating their subscribers. A relatively small number of patients would also pay directly for their own treatment. In 2010 one private practice consultant received more than â¬1 million from the VHI, which was criticised by Dr Reilly when the figures subsequently emerged. VHI fees to consultants have been reduced considerably since that time. Claim increase Speaking in the DÃ¡il last Thursday, the Minister said âthe average claim per insured person increased by 12.6 per cent per annum between 2008 and 2012, largely as a result of increased usage of hospital services, with insurers attributing premium increases to increased claims costs and ageing memberships. Clearly increases of this magnitude are not sustainable.â Return to results
Report highlights âdisturbing resemblanceâ between Savita case and death of another woman Report highlights âdisturbing resemblanceâ between Savita case and death of another woman Hiqa highlights âfundamental and worrying deficitâ in the Stateâs health system Tania McCabe (centre): HSE inquiry found âsystems failureâ led to her death Colin Gleeson The treatment received by Savita Halappanavar at Galway University Hospital in the days before her death bears a âdisturbing resemblanceâ to the case of another pregnant woman who died six years ago, according to the report of the Stateâs health watchdog into her death. The Health Information and Quality Authority report frequently draws comparisons between the case of Ms Halappanavar and that of Tania McCabe, who died at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda, in 2007. It is highly critical of the HSEâs failure to implement recommendations from the HSE report into the death of Ms McCabe on a national level, recommendations the health watchdog says had âparticular relevanceâ to the case of Ms Halappanavar. Ms McCabe was 34 years old and six months pregnant with twins when she presented at the Drogheda hospital on March 6th, 2007. She believed her waters were breaking. Her consultant, however, believed she had âan episode of urinary incontinence rather than a rupture of membranesâ, the HSE inquiry found. Discharged She was kept in overnight and the following morning a midwife noted she believed the womanâs waters had broken. This information did not find its way to the consultant, who decided to discharge her. When she returned to the hospital more than 30 hours later to give birth, sepsis had set in, which was a significant factor in her death, along âwith haemorrhage as a complicating factorâ. One of her twins also died. As in the case of Ms Halappanavar, the HSE inquiry team found it was a âsystems failureâ that led to her death. The report notes that only five of the countryâs 19 maternity units were able to provide a detailed status update on the implementation of recommendations from the Tania McCabe report. These were the Midlands Regional Hospital Mullingar, the Coombe in Dublin, the Rotunda in Dublin, Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda, and the Mid-Western Regional Maternity Hospital in Limerick. Six of the 19 maternity units reported their status against a different investigation, had no comment, or reported that evidence for implementation was not in existence. âThis is unsatisfactory and concerning,â says the report. It also says the lack of a ânationally co-ordinated approachâ to the implementation of the recommendations and the âambiguityâ regarding who has overall ownership of and responsibility for implementing the National Clinical Care Programmes raises âa fun damental and worrying deficitâ in the Stateâs health system.

Republicans stand firm on US debt ceiling Republicans stand firm on US debt ceiling As shutdown enters sixth day, Boehner says it is time to deal with âAmericaâs problemsâ A closed sign hangs at the entrance to the US Treasury building in Washington DC. US House of Representatives Speaker John Boehner ruled out agreeing to a measure to raise the nationâs debt ceiling unless it includes conditions to rein in deficit spending. Photographer: Julia Schmalz/Online News US House of Representatives Speaker John Boehner said today that there is âno wayâ Republican lawmakers will agree to a measure to raise the nationâs debt ceiling unless it includes conditions to rein in deficit spending. Pressed on the ABC news program âThis Weekâ on whether the Republican-led House would pass a âcleanâ debt ceiling increase that included no conditions, Mr Boehner replied: âI told the president, thereâs no way weâre going to pass one.â âWeâre not going down that path,â he added. âIt is time to deal with Americaâs problems. How can you raise the debt limit and do nothing about the underlying problem?â As the country moved into the sixth day of a government shutdown, Mr Boehner was equally adamant that Republicans would demand concessions for any bill to reopen the government. Republicans want changes to president Barack Obamaâs signature healthcare law known as Obamacare as a condition for backing a measure to fund government agencies. Mr Obama and the Democratic-led Senate have rejected that demand. Mr Obama has also said it is the responsibility of Congress to raise the debt limit by an October 17th deadline when the government will begin running short of the funds needed to pay its bills. He has said he will not negotiate with Republicans over that issue. On the impasse over the government shutdown, Mr Boehner said there had âabsolutely notâ been any changes in the Republican position on the bill to fund the government. (Online News) .

Robben and Cole earn Chelsea win Robben and Cole earn Chelsea win Cheslea salvaged a win against a battling Portsmouth side just as it looked like the Premiership leaders would have to settle for a point. Arjen Robben curled in a late deflected left-footed shot from the right side of Pompey's box to break the home side's brave resistance. Chelsea had been continually frustrated but Joe Cole added a second with a 20-yard shot in injury-time. Nigel Quashie had Pompey's best chance when his effort was tipped over. The Fratton Park crowd were in good voice as usual and, even though Portsmouth more than held their own, Chelsea still managed to carve out two early chances. Striker Didier Drogba snapped in an angled shot to force home keeper Shaka Hislop into a smart save while an unmarked Frank Lampard had a strike blocked by Arjan De Zeeuw. But Pompey chased, harried and unsettled a Chelsea side as the south-coast side started to gain the upper hand and almost took the lead through Quashie. The midfielder struck a swerving long range shot which keeper Petr Cech tipped over at full stretch. Pompey stretched Arsenal to the limit recently and were providing a similarly tough obstacle to overcome for a Chelsea team struggling to exert any pressure. Velimir Zajec's players stood firm as the visitors came out in lively fashion after the break but, just as they took a stranglehold of the match, the visitors launched a counter-attack. Drogba spun to get a sight of goal and struck a fierce shot which rocked keeper Hislop back as he blocked before Arjan de Zeeuw cleared the danger. The home side were also left breathing a sigh of relief when a Glen Johnson header fell to Gudjohnsen who had his back to goal in a crowded Pompey goalmouth. The Icelandic forward tried to acrobatically direct the ball into goal but put his effort over. But, just like against Arsenal, Portsmouth let in a late goal when Robben's shot took a deflection off Matthew Taylor on its way past a wrong-footed Hislop. And Cole put a bit of gloss on a hard-fought win when he put a low shot into the bottom of the Pompey net.

Robben plays down European return Robben plays down European return Injured Chelsea winger Arjen Robben has insisted that he only has a 10% chance of making a return against Barcelona in the Champions League. The 21-year-old has been sidelined since breaking a foot against Blackburn last month. Chelsea face Barcelona at home on 8 March having lost 2-1 in the first leg. And Robben told the Daily Star: "It is not impossible that I will play against Barcelona but it is just a very, very small chance - about 10%." Robben has been an inspirational player for Chelsea this season following a switch from PSV Einhoven last summer. He added: "My recovery is going better than we expected a few weeks ago but I think the Barcelona game will come too soon. "I won't take any risks and come back too soon." Return to results
SA supports Fifa control SA supports Fifa control South African President Thabo Mbeki said on Thursday the composition of the 2010 World Cup Local Organising Committee (LOC) would "be left up to Fifa". In a show of support for the event, Mbeki said South African government ministers would also be made available for inclusion on the LOC. This came after speculation that there was a rift between Fifa and the South African Football Association (Safa) over who would serve on the committee. Mbeki was speaking to the media after Fifa president Sepp Blatter had accepted a prestigious national award - the Order of the Companions of O.R. Tambo, named after former ANC President Oliver Tambo. "The award is being given to Fifa for its exceptional contribution to the development of football in Africa and its contribution to bringing about South Africa's democracy," said President Mbeki. Other recipients of the award include United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan, leading U.S. civil rights leader Martin Luther King and Kwame Nkrumah, the first prime minister of Ghana. Earlier, Blatter made it clear that the World Cup belonged to Fifa and not Safa, and expressed his preferences for various people to be in particular positions within football in South Africa. In response, Safa president Molefi Oliphant confirmed that Danny Jordaan would be appointed chief executive of the 2010 World Cup LOC. Speaking at a press briefing, Oliphant said: "I said that we would put Mr Blatter's suggestion to the Safa executive and after discussion on the matter it was accepted." The acceptance of Blatter's suggestions means Oliphant will stand for re-election as Safa president instead of stepping aside later this year as he had indicated he would. Blatter said he was delighted with the decision. "These are the three men who helped bring the World Cup to South Africa. "It is important that we have continuity," the Fifa boss said. Jordaan - currently chief executive of Safa - remained tight-lipped on the matter. "My opinion is irrelevant," he said. "You have heard from the Fifa president, you have heard from the Safa president and you have heard from the chairman of the LOC." Comments are closed for this article.
Software watching while you work Software watching while you work Software that can not only monitor every keystroke and action performed at a PC but also be used as legally binding evidence of wrong-doing has been unveiled. Worries about cyber-crime and sabotage have prompted many employers to consider monitoring employees. The developers behind the system claim it is a break-through in the way data is monitored and stored. But privacy advocates are concerned by the invasive nature of such software. The system is a joint venture between security firm 3ami and storage specialists BridgeHead Software. They have joined forces to create a system which can monitor computer activity, store it and retrieve disputed files within minutes. More and more firms are finding themselves in deep water as a result of data misuse. Sabotage and data theft are most commonly committed from within an organisation according to the National Hi-Tech Crime Unit (NHTCU) A survey conducted on its behalf by NOP found evidence that more than 80% of medium and large companies have been victims of some form of cyber-crime. BridgeHead Software has come up with techniques to prove, to a legal standard, that any stored file on a PC has not been tampered with. Ironically the impetus for developing the system came as a result of the Freedom of Information Act, which requires companies to store all data for a certain amount of time. The storage system has been incorporated into an application developed by security firm 3ami which allows every action on a computer to be logged. Potentially it could help employers to follow the trail of stolen files and pinpoint whether they had been emailed to a third party, copied, printed, deleted or saved to CD, floppy disk, memory stick or flash card. Other activities the system can monitor include the downloading of pornography, the use of racist or bullying language or the copying of applications for personal use. Increasingly organisations that handle sensitive data, such as governments, are using biometric log-ins such as fingerprinting to provide conclusive proof of who was using a particular machine at any given time. Privacy advocates are concerned that monitoring at work is not only damaging to employee's privacy but also to the relationship between employers and their staff. "That is not the case," said Tim Ellsmore, managing director of 3ami. "It is not about replacing dialogue but there are issues that you can talk through but you still need proof," he said.

St Jamesâs Hospital warns it faces deficit of â¬15m St Jamesâs Hospital warns it faces deficit of â¬15m Some hospitals preparing to operate on overdraft to minimise impact on patients The Accident & Emergency Department of St. Jamesâs Hospital The countryâs biggest hospital, St Jamesâs Hospital in Dublin, has warned the Health Service Executive that its budgetary position is unsustainable. The hospital wants the HSE to ârectifyâ its allocation to avoid recording a deficit of â¬15 million by the end of the year. âWe have repeatedly asked the HSE to take account of the hospitalâs increased complexity and volume of services, and its leading role in cancer services and many national specialities when setting its allocation provisions,â a spokesman told The Online News last night. âSt Jamesâs Hospital will continue to work with the HSE to ensure core patient services are protected in the short and long term, and we have urged the HSE that a rectification of the allocation be fully pursued immediately.â Earlier this week it emerged that the countryâs hospitals were collectively â¬75 million in the red at the end of August. Increased patient numbers, driven by a rise in respiratory problems affecting older people during the winter and a long, cold spring, have increased pressure on spending in hospitals across the State. St Jamesâs recorded the highest individual hospital deficit in August at â¬10.4 million. A number of hospitals are making preparations to operate on an overdraft in order to minimise the impact on patient services over the coming months. The HSEâs overall deficit by the end of the year is expected to reach â¬150-â¬200 million, and could be higher. It was announced in the budget last week that â¬666 million is to be cut from the health budget next year, but since then it has emerged that the cut could be much larger, possibly up to â¬1 billion. St Jamesâs suffered the largest individual budget cut of any hospital when a rebalancing was carried out at the start of this year and its funding was reduced by â¬7 million. The hospital says it has seen its funding cut by more than â¬100 million since 2009, with a â¬25 million reduction to the core patient services budget this year. Included in this amount is â¬4 million deducted in respect of measures to increase income from private beds in the hospital this year, which are not now being implemented until next year. Staff numbers Another â¬1.5 million was deducted in anticipation of reduced staff numbers which have not materialised; the hospital says the framework for reducing numbers has not yet been established by the HSE and is unlikely to happen before year-end. St Jamesâs says the cut in its budget to reflect the Haddington Road Agreement is more than twice as high as the maximum savings it can fully verify. It says â¬5.7 million in savings will accrue from the agreement but the corresponding budget cut is â¬11.2 million. St Vincentâs Hospital in Dublin was â¬8.6 million over-budget in August, but HSE officials acknowledged it had opened 60 extra beds and was coping with complex demands in its emergency department due to the higher proportion of older people in its catchment area.

State âunpreparedâ to care for ageing population State âunpreparedâ to care for ageing population Department of Health says cannot be assumed same number older people will be cared for in residential facilities as are now Government policy is to support older people to live in their own homes for as long as possible, the Nursing Homes Ireland annual conference has been told. File Photograph: Dara Mac DÃ³naill/The Online News The Government has warned nursing home owners that extra residential places may not be provided to meet an ageing population and more older people may have to live at home for longer. Speaking at the Nursing Homes Ireland annual conference this morning, the secretary general of the Department of Health Dr Ambrose McLoughlin said the Government was acutely aware of demographic projections that by 2041 there would be about 1.4 million people over the age of 65 in Ireland, with the greatest increase in the over 80 age group. Addressing delegates from 400 private and public nursing homes, Dr McLoughlin said Government policy was to support older people to live in their own homes for as long as possible and to ensure only the most highly dependent people are in long term nursing care. Responding to calls for funding for more nursing home beds, Dr McLoughlin said: âPlanning for the future cannot simply be a calculation of future residential demand based on the assumption that the same proportion of our older population will be in residential care as is now the case.â In his address, managing partner of consultancy group BDO, Derry Gray said the State was âseriously unpreparedâ to care for its aging population. He said some 4,200 extra nursing home beds would be required to meet to demand by 2016 however âa continued absence of a realistic national strategyâ on the care of older people means they would not be available. Some 53 new nursing homes will be required to meet demand, Mr Gray said. He claimed a lack of State strategy on residential care for older people was proving a barrier to their creation. A need for hefty investment into existing public units to bring them into compliance with national standards meant it was unlikely the State could contribute to new bed capacity, Mr Gray said. He said in reality it would fall to the private sector to provide the extra capacity. Chief executive of Nursing Homes Ireland, Tadhg Daly said the lack of beds for them was a crisis that could be avoided. âThis sector stands ready to invest up to â¬1 billion to create 1,000 long-term jobs a year for the next 10 years,â he said. âHowever, with a clear, co-ordinated strategy on long term care, there can be no business confidence in this scale of investment.â Dr McLoughlin said he accepted the sector could not make investment decisions without knowing Government plans. He said based an ongoing HSE review of its residential facilities and a current review of the nursing home support scheme by Deloitte, his department was working closely with the HSE to develop an overall plan regarding the future public division of long stay residential care services. âThe plan will reflect both national and regional requirements and will have regard to the very severe financial constraints and restrictions on public sector staffing and recruitment and the ongoing need to meet service and safety standards all of which pose challenges for community nursing units across the country.â Dr McLoughlin said his department was in talks with the Department of Public Expenditure and hoped to see a stimulus package for the sector approved by Government in the near future. He said he anticipated there would be a decision by early to mid-2014. Dr McLoughlin also told the conference every nursing home should be tobacco free. âThere is no argument for them to facilitate smoking or for their staff to smoke.â Comments are closed for this article.
Study involved 400 accountants in senior positions Study involved 400 accountants in senior positions The economic recovery is gaining strength and filtering down from exporters to the domestic economy, according to a quarterly business sentiment survey. The latest KBC Bank Ireland/Chartered Accountants Ireland study of 400 accountants in senior positions found this month that 47 per cent reported more business activity in the last three months. Positive responses That was the highest number of positive responses since the summer of 2007. The number of companies reporting a dip in activity fell to 15 per cent, also the best result in six years. The strongest level of positive responses came from the construction and property sectors. More than half of construction firms were busier in the last three months, 10 times the number who said their business was declining. Austin Hughes, chief economist at KBC, said the report was âvery encouragingâ, particularly for the construction sector. âThe best thing about it is that it now seems that all of the eggs are not in one basket. The recovery is broadening in scope.â Return to results
Study, commissioned by MasterCard, outlines potential consequences of EC proposals Study, commissioned by MasterCard, outlines potential consequences of EC proposals The study suggests the changes could lead to annual shortfall of â¬107 million in funds to cover costs incurred in running Irelandâs card payments system. Photograph: Peter Macdiarmid/Getty Images Irish consumers could end up paying more than â¬100 million extra in annual credit and debit card fees under new European Commission proposals, a new study claims. The research, carried out by economist Anthony Foley on behalf of MasterCard , examined the potential consequences that could result from moves to reduce the contribution merchants make to funding the cost of card payments. The study suggests the changes could lead to annual shortfall of â¬107 million in funds to cover costs incurred in running Irelandâs card payments system. The knock-on effects of this, the report claims, would be additional annual charges of â¬89 million for credit card users and â¬18 million for debit card users in Ireland - equivalent to â¬42.50 per credit card and â¬4.60 per debit card. The report suggests the changes would also âact as a barrier to Government efforts to reduce the excessive role of cash and cheques in the Irish payments system,â the report said. It noted that a substantial move away from using cash and cheques - in line with the Governmentâs national payments plan - would provide a saving of over â¬1 billion per annum for the economy. Mr Foley said: âThe most important fact arising from the analysis is that over â¬100 million annually will be withdrawn from the Irish electronic payments system, over â¬500 million in five years.â âIt is very difficult to assume that such a large withdrawal would not have an adverse effect on the aim of bringing the payments system to best international practice.â âThe current EU intention to reduce interchange fees is clearly inappropriate for current and near future Irish economic and banking circumstances,â add Mr Foley. âThe Government should not support the proposed regulation without first undertaking a comprehensive analysis of the possible consequences on consumers, bank revenue and the wider economy.â In July, the Commission published a series of proposals to reduce the contribution merchants make to funding the cost of card payments as part of its regulatory approach to Europeâs electronic payments system. The proposals include a possible cap on interchange fees, which are the fees a retailerâs bank pays a consumerâs bank to cover a portion of the costs associated with card transactions such as payment guarantees, risks due to fraud and bad debt, and running the payments network.

Swap offer for pirated Windows XP Swap offer for pirated Windows XP Computer giant Microsoft has launched a pilot scheme to replace counterfeit versions of Windows XP with legal ones. The first-time initiative is restricted to the UK and to users with pre-installed copies of the operating system in PCs bought before November. Until December Microsoft said software can be sent to it for analysis if there are doubts about its legitimacy. The company aims to detect illegal traders and turn users of fake versions of Windows into legitimate ones. The Windows XP Counterfeit Project will mean that software that is found to be counterfeit will be replaced for free, subject to certain conditions, until the end of the year. It is the first time Microsoft has launched a counterfeit product replacement scheme in the world, the company told the Online News News website. In June, the software giant said that the major security update to Windows XP, Service Pack 2, would not work with the most widely pirated versions of its operating system. The upgrade closed security loopholes in XP and added features that made it easier to keep machines safe from viruses and other types of malicious computer code. The US company invited anyone who had suspicions about their version of Windows XP to submit it for testing as soon as possible. The procedure consists of a series of computer checks, collating documents, and filling out a witness statement. "This is a great opportunity for users to confirm the authenticity of Windows XP software whilst helping gather vital information about illegal traders", said Alex Hilton, licence compliance manager at Microsoft. The scheme has also been welcomed by the technology and commerce industry. "It is important that users ensure that they are legally licensed to avoid the risks of purchasing and using counterfeit products", said David Frost, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce. The plan would enable Microsoft to gather intelligence about illegal traders in a prompt way, which would allow it to take action against software pirates. Microsoft said it would evaluate the results of the UK programme before setting up similar schemes in other countries. Comments are closed for this article.
Taoiseach writes to MEPs before key tobacco vote Taoiseach writes to MEPs before key tobacco vote Taoiseach writes to Irish MEPs and members of European Peopleâs Party in advance of vote Taoiseach said he was concerned at a proposal to reduce the size of the health warning on cigarette packaging to 50 per cent from the 75 per cent advocated by the member states. Taoiseach Enda Kenny has written to all Irish MEPs and members of the centre-right European Peopleâs Party (EPP) in the European Parliament urging them not to vote in favour of an amendment which would reduce the size of health warnings on cigarette packaging. MEPs will vote today in Strasbourg on a number of proposed amendments to the EUâs tobacco directive, a key piece of EU legislation which was agreed by EU health ministers under the Irish presidency of the EU Council in June. Under the EU system, the European Parliament must now agree on their own position on the directive before negotiations with member states on a final package can begin. Industry lobbying However, the parliamentâs vote on the directive was postponed last month amid widespread allegations of intense lobbying by tobacco companies and resistance from some tobacco-producing member states. In the letter sent yesterday to MEPs and co-signed by Minister for Health James Reilly , Enda Kenny said he was concerned at a proposal to reduce the size of the health warning on cigarette packaging to 50 per cent from the 75 per cent advocated by the member states. Mr Kenny said an amendment to reduce the size of the health warning could jeopardise the conclusion of the negotiations before next yearâs European Parliament elections. As well as the proposal on packaging, MEPs will vote on a proposal to ban menthol cigarettes and a controversial proposal to regulate e-cigarettes as a medicinal product. The parliament could also opt to delay the vote once more. While the new rules would be binding on all countries in the European Union , individual member states are free to introduce their own, more stringent anti-tobacco measures.

The Health Information and Quality Authority identified 13 things that could have made a difference The Health Information and Quality Authority identified 13 things that could have made a difference Savita Halappanavar, who was 17 weeks pregnant, died of sepsis following a miscarriage at University Hospital Galway. Photograph: Joe OâShaughnessy. 13/11/2012 Colin Gleeson The Health Information and Quality Authority identified, through a review of Savita Halappanavarâs healthcare records, 13 missed opportunities which, had they been identified and acted upon, might have potentially changed the outcome of her care. 1 October 21, 2012 3.30pm-10pm Blood tests were taken after Ms Halappanavar was admitted to an inpatient room when a diagnosis of inevitable/impending pregnancy loss was made by the obstetrics and gynaecology registrar following clinical findings. These results showed an elevated white cell count which should have alerted staff to investigate the cause of this further. 2October 22 Spontaneous rupture of membranes occurred. Four-hourly observations to include temperature, heart rate and respiration and blood pressure were not recorded. Prophylactic antibiotics to minimise the risk of infection were not prescribed. 3 October 22 8.20am Ms Halappanavar was reviewed by the consultant obstetrician in charge of her care. The team was aware that she had suffered a spontaneous rupture of membranes overnight. Her plan of care, following this, was that a foetal ultrasound scan would be taken with instructions to âawait eventsâ. Hiqa is of the opinion a more comprehensive plan of care should have been developed and documented following this clinical review. 4 October 22-23 3.25pmâ6am Three recordings of low blood pressure and two of an elevated heart rate were documented. The clinical significance of these signs, over a 15-hour period, was not recognised by the clinical staff. They indicated signs of clinical deterioration, for which infection would be a likely cause. 5 October 23 8.30am Ms Halappanavar was reviewed by the consultant obstetrician in charge of her care. The clinical staff in charge and looking after her did not recognise, document or manage the risks in relation to her changing clinical state. For example, at this time, it was 24 hours since she had had a spontaneous rupture of membranes, after which time the risk of infection in the uterus increases. 6 October 23 2.45pm-8pm Over a five-hour period, Ms Halappanavar had three recordings of an increasingly elevated heart rate. Staff did not recognise the significance of these recordings along with other clinical indications as an important indicator of clinical deterioration. 7 October 23-24 9pm-1am Ms Halappanavar complained of weakness. When staff caring for her contacted a non-consultant hospital doctor, the doctor was not immediately available to come and review the patient. Given the seriousness of her condition, staff did not appear to have recognised the urgent need to request she be reviewed by another doctor. 8-10 October 24 4.15am-5am Ms Halappanavar had a raised temperature, was shivering and had vomited. Staff did not recognise the significance of these clinical symptoms. Vomiting in a patient who was presenting clinical symptoms like this could potentially suggest sepsis. 11-12 October 24 Ms Halappanavarâs temperature and pulse rate were elevated and her blood pressure was low. She was complaining of feeling weak, general body aches and had an offensive smelling vaginal discharge. Following a diagnosis of âchorioamnionitis with probable sepsisâ, evidence shows her treatment plan was not changed at this time. 13 October 24 8.25am Women with maternal infection can deteriorate rapidly from sepsis, to severe sepsis and then into septic shock. The doctors in charge of and caring for Ms Halappanavar, despite a diagnosis of chorioamnionitis with probable sepsis being made, did not appear to recognise the significance of this diagnosis and the continuing deteriorating clinical signs. In line with local guidelines, this should have prompted contact with a consultant microbiologist and other senior members of the multidisciplinary team, including critical care personnel who should be involved early in the process, if sepsis is suspected or diagnosed to discuss ongoing management.

The pirates with no profit motive The pirates with no profit motive Two men who were part of a huge network of internet software pirates, known as Drink Or Die, have been convicted at the Old Bailey. Online News News investigates how the network worked and what motivated those involved. They called themselves Drink Or Die (DOD). They were a network of computer buffs who derived pleasure from cracking codes protecting copyrighted software such as Windows 95. They would then share it with each other. There is no suggestion any of them profited financially. But the authorities in both Britain and the United States considered it software piracy and took a dim view of networks such as DOD, one of a number of so-called warez organisations operating on the internet. In October 2000 the US Customs Service began an investigation into DOD and other networks, such as Razor 1911, Risciso, Myth and Popz. Fourteen months later US Customs co-ordinated a series of raids across the globe as part of Operation Buccaneer. Seventy search warrants were executed in the US, Britain, Australia, Norway, Sweden and Finland. At least 60 people were arrested worldwide - 45 of them in the US. Among the leaders of the network were Americans John Sankus - known by his internet nickname Eriflleh (Hellfire spelt backwards) - Richard Berry, Kent Kartadinata and Christopher Tresco, who used a server based at the prestigious Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). The longest jail sentence - 46 months - was handed down to Sankus, a 28-year-old from Philadelphia. US Attorney Paul McNulty said at the time: "John Sankus and his techno-gang operated in the faceless world of the internet and thought they would never be caught. "They were wrong. These sentences, and those to follow, should send a message to others entertaining similar beliefs of invincibility." But one man still in legal limbo is British-born Australian Hew Raymond Griffiths, who is still fighting against extradition to the US. US Customs claimed Mr Griffiths was one of DOD's leaders but his lawyer, Antony Townsden, told the Online News News website it was a laughable suggestion and added: "He was living on welfare and had such an old computer that he couldn't even download software. "The allegation that he was the group's co-leader is illusory. He had the least technical skills of anyone, he couldn't crack any codes and he has only been called a leader because he was a loudmouth who wrote a lot on their messageboard." Mr Townsden said if he had committed any crimes he should be prosecuted in Australia, not the US. He claimed the Australian government's decision to accept the extradition request was typical of their current "acquiescent" attitude to the US. Mr Griffiths is expecting to hear this week the outcome of his appeal against the decision to extradite him. Those involved would give themselves internet aliases which would act in the same way as tags used by graffiti artists. They could then brag about their code-cracking abilities without giving away their real identities. Alex Bell, whose trial at the Old Bailey ended on Friday, was known as Mr 2940 - after a computer device - while his co-defendant Steven Dowd's nickname, curiously, was Tim. A spokesman for US Immigration, Customs and Enforcement, Dean Boyd, said DOD did not appear to be motivated by money. Their motivation was the kudos which surrounded being able to crack sophisticated software. He told the Online News News website: "Primarily they were just interested in how fast they could crack the code. It was all about underground notoriety." But Mr Boyd pointed out that once the software had been distributed on the internet it fell into the hands of organised criminals who were able to mass produce pirated software at zero cost. "It cost US industries a lot of money, billions of dollars," he said. Mr Boyd said: "It was truly global in scope. We raided a number of universities, including Duke (in North Carolina) and MIT, and found that several of the people involved were employed by major computer corporations. "They would go home from work in the evenings and get involved in this warez culture." Warez groups, which began to surface in the early 1990s, operate according to a strict code of honour. For example if one group cracked the software first its rivals would respect that achievement and not seek to claim it themselves. Mr Boyd said the destruction of DOD was a great coup but he added: "I'm not going to sit here and say we have sorted the problem. There are still hackers and people who do this for fun. "Internet piracy of computer software remains a gigantic problem." A spokesman for the Business Software Alliance said: "DOD members claim they did not profit at all. But they did profit by getting access to very expensive servers." He said DOD and other warez groups were fostering a "culture of piracy" on the internet. He said 29% of computer software in Britain was believed to have been pirated and this cost Â£1bn in revenue for software companies, their suppliers and distributors. "It may seem like a victimless crime but it touches more people than you might care to believe." Comments are closed for this article.
The warning by the chief executives of four Dublin teaching hospitals that hospital funding cuts are... The warning by the chief executives of four Dublin teaching hospitals that hospital funding cuts are seriously threatening the quality and safety of patient services is unprecedented. In a letter to Health Service Executive (HSE) director general Tony OâBrien last week, they say that, as a result, âunacceptable delaysâ have emerged in accessing treatments for some cancer patients. And in an apparent reference to the recent Hiqa report into the death of Savita Halappanavar , they note that the threat to patient safety is highlighted by the emergence of âhighly publicised sentinel events in the acute systemâ. Set against the current HSE efforts to draw up a service plan for 2014 to accommodate a spending reduction of at least â¬666 million, the move reflects a fundamental resistance to the level of cuts being demanded by the Departments of Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform. Many observers believe the actual savings needed will be closer to â¬1 billion, when an overrun on this yearâs health budget is accounted for as well as a likely difficulty in delivering planned savings in the medical card and other demand-led schemes. In a reference to a more than 20 per cent cut in their funding since 2009, the four hospitals say there is evidence to suggest that these reductions have been âdetermined and applied arbitrarilyâ. All of which represents a significant threat to the safety of patients across the health system. Even with full resources, it is estimated that about 10 per cent of hospital admissions are associated with an adverse outcome for patients; about half of these are preventable. But with resources stretched to the extreme, there is a real and present danger to the quality and safety of patient care. Minister for Health James Reillyâs assertion that he has made clear to the HSE that despite the severe budgetary constraints he expects it to make patient safety a priority within its service plan is hardly reassuring. Not when the Halappanavar inquiry unearthed evidence that, in times of budgetary plenty, the HSE failed to implement important safety directives across the maternity system. Adverse outcomes for patients resulting from treatment readily come to mind when considering issues around patient safety. But patients can also suffer from acts of omission and it is in this context that the warning from the chief executives is especially stark. Delays in the timely administration of cancer treatments represent a real threat to peopleâs lives. A delay in initiating treatment modalities such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy represents the most fundamental failure of a modern health system. Bland reassurances from the Taoiseach and Minister for Health are not enough. Patient safety is non-negotiable; the Government must respond to this weekâs warnings with alacrity. .

Tottenham bid &#163;8m for Forest duo Tottenham bid &#163;8m for Forest duo Nottingham Forest have confirmed they have received an Â£8m bid from Tottenham for Andy Reid and Michael Dawson. Reid rejected a move to Southampton after Forest accepted a cash-plus-players offer while Spurs had made previous bids for the 22-year-old. Spurs had also made an undisclosed offer for 21-year-old defender Dawson. Forest chief executive Mark Arthur said: "We've received an Â£8m bid from Spurs for the two players and we're considering the offer." Southampton's offer for Republic of Ireland international Reid comprised Â£3m-plus and two players - Brett Ormerod and Darren Kenton. Spurs had seen previous bids of Â£3m, Â£4m and Â£5m for Reid rejected by the Championship club. Comments are closed for this article.
US duo in first spam conviction US duo in first spam conviction A brother and sister in the US have been convicted of sending hundreds of thousands of unsolicited e-mail messages to AOL subscribers. It is the first criminal prosecution of internet spam distributors. Jurors in Virginia recommended that the man, Jeremy Jaynes, serve nine years in prison and that his sister, Jessica DeGroot, be fined $7,500. They were convicted under a state law that bars the sending of bulk e-mails using fake addresses. They will be formally sentenced next year. A third defendant, Richard Rutkowski, was acquitted. Prosecutors said Jaynes was "a snake oil salesman in a new format", using the internet to peddle useless wares, news agency Associated Press reported. A "Fed-Ex refund processor" was supposed to allow people to earn $75 an hour working from home. Another item on sale was an "internet history eraser". His sister helped him process credit card payments. Jaynes amassed a fortune of $24m from his sales, prosecutors said. "He's been successful ripping people off all these years," AP quoted prosecutor Russell McGuire as saying. Jaynes was also found guilty of breaking a state law which prohibits the sending of more than 100,000 e-mails in 30 days, Virginia State Attorney General Jerry Kilgore reportedly said. Prosecutors had asked for 15 years in jail for Jaynes, and a jail term for his sister. But Jaynes' lawyer David Oblon called the nine-year recommended term "outrageous" and said his client believed he was innocent. He pointed out that all three of the accused lived in North Carolina and were unaware of the Virginia state law. Spam messages are estimated to account for at least 60% of all e-mails sent.

US peer-to-peer pirates convicted US peer-to-peer pirates convicted The first convictions for piracy over peer-to-peer networks have been handed down in the US. New Yorker William Trowbridge and Texan Michael Chicoine have pleaded guilty to charges that they infringed copyright by illegally sharing music, movies and software. The two men faced charges following raids in August on suspected pirates by the FBI. The pair face jail terms of up to five years and a $250,000 (Â£130,000) fine. In a statement the US Department of Justice said the two men operated the central hubs in a piracy community organised across the Direct Connect peer-to-peer network. The piracy group called itself the Underground Network and membership of it demanded that users share between one and 100 gigabytes of files. Direct Connect allows users to set themselves up as central servers that act as co-ordinating spots for sharers. Users would swap files, such as films and music, by exchanging data over the network. During its investigation FBI agents reportedly downloaded 84 movies, 40 software programs, 13 games and 178 "sound recordings" from the five hubs that made up the larger piracy group. The raids were organised under the umbrella of Operation Digital Gridlock which was aimed at fighting "criminal copyright theft on peer-to-peer networks". In total, six raids were carried out in August. Five were on the homes of suspected copyright thieves and one on a net service firm. The Department of Justice said that both men pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit felony copyright infringement. They also pleaded guilty to acting for commercial advantage. The two men are due to be sentenced on 29 April. Comments are closed for this article.
Visitors will only be allowed in âexceptional circumstancesâ after Norovirus outbreak Visitors will only be allowed in âexceptional circumstancesâ after Norovirus outbreak Visitors will only be permitted into Beaumont Hospital in Dublin this weekend in exceptional circumstances due to a Norovirus outbreak in the community. Photographer: Dara MacDÃ³naill. Visitors will only be permitted into Dublinâs Beaumont Hospital this weekend in âexceptional circumstancesâ as the hospital attempts to battle an outbreak of the winter vomiting bug. The measure will also apply to those seeking to visit St Josephâs Hospital in Raheny . A similar strategy was implemented at both hospitals last weekend as officials sought to contain an outbreak of the bug in the community. The symptoms of the bug include nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. The winter vomiting bug (Norovirus) is highly contagious. âThe hospital is urging members of the public who are symptomatic of Norovirus to seek medical advice from their local GP before presenting to Beaumont Hospital emergency department,â Beaumont Hospital said in a statement. âThis is against the backdrop of an increased incidence of the winter vomiting bug in the community. Visitor exemptions may be granted at ward level in exceptional circumstances only.â Comments are closed for this article.
Web photo storage market hots up Web photo storage market hots up An increasing number of firms are offering web storage for people with digital photo collections. Digital cameras were the hot gadget of Christmas 2004 and worldwide sales of the cameras totalled $24bn last year. Many people's hard drives are bulging with photos and services which allow them to store and share their pictures online are becoming popular. Search firms such as Google are also offering more complex tools for managing personal photo libraries. Photo giants such as Kodak offer website storage which manages photo collections, lets users edit pictures online and provides print-ordering services. Some services, such as Kodak's Ofoto and Snapfish, offer unlimited storage space but they do require users to buy some prints online. Other sites, such as Pixagogo, charge a monthly fee. Marcus Hawkins, editor of Digital Camera magazine, said: "As file sizes of pictures increase, storage becomes a problem. "People are using their hard drives, backing up on CD and DVD and now they are using online storage solutions. "They are a place to store pictures, to share their pictures with families and friends and they can print out their photos." While many of the services are aimed at the amateur and casual digital photographer, other websites are geared up for enthusiasts who want to share tips and information. Photosig is an online community of photographers who can critique each other's work. On Tuesday, Google released free software for organising and finding digital photos stored on a computer's hard drive. The tool, called Picasa, automatically detects photos as they are added to a PC - whether sent via e-mail or transferred from a digital camera. The software includes tools for restoring colour and removing red eye, as well as sharpening images. Photos can then be uploaded to sites such as Ofoto. Many people use the sites to edit and improve their favourite photographs before ordering prints. Mr Hawkins added: "The growth area is that you can order your prints online. Friends and family can also access pictures you want them to see and they can print them out too. "Rather than just a place to dump your pictures, it's about sharing them." The vast majority of pictures remain on a PC's hard drive, which is why search tools, such as those offered by Google, become increasingly important. But some historians and archivists are concerned that the need for perfect pictures will mean that those poor quality prints which offered a tantilising glimpse of the past may disappear forever. "It's one thing taking pictures, it's another finding them," said Mr Hawkins. "But this is the same problem that has always existed - how many of us have photos in wallets tucked away somewhere?"

Wolfgang Schaeuble says retroactive recapitalisation would require law change Wolfgang Schaeuble says retroactive recapitalisation would require law change Germanyâs finance minister Wolfgang Schaeuble (left) with EU economic and monetary affairs commissioner Olli Rehn. Photograph: Andrew Harrer/Online News German finance minister Wolfgang Schaeuble has reiterated German opposition to using the ESM fund to directly recapitalise Irish banks, saying that the current ESM treaty does not allow for retroactive action, and adding that the process would require a change in German legislation. Speaking in Luxembourg this lunch time on the fringes of an EU finance ministersâ meeting, the German finance minister said that retroactive direct recapitalisation for Ireland was ânot probableâ. âIreland did what Ireland had to do... now everything is fine,â Mr Schauble said. His comments underline the growing sense in German circles that Irelandâs strong performance under the bailout has lessened its case for further debt relief on its â¬64 billion bank bailout. Ireland has been hopeful of securing direct recapitalisation of its banks from the euro zoneâs permanent rescue fund, the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) . The â¬500 billion fund has â¬60 billion earmarked for direct bank recapitalisation, and in June euro zone finance ministers agreed in principle to consider requests for retroactive application of the instrument on a âcase by case basis.â However, any decision on deploying the fund retroactively needs unanimity from member states, effectively giving Germany a veto on a decision. Germany, Finland and the Netherlands have been consistently opposed to granting debt relief to so-called âlegacyâ assets. In September 2012 the three countries issued a joint statement , arguing that legacy assets should be under the responsibility of national authorities, despite a commitment three months earlier to look at Irelandâs specific situation. Irelandâs plea for further debt relief for its banks has emerged as a discussion point in German coalition negotiations. The left of centre Social Democrats party has argued that future decisions on Irelandâs financial situation would take into account its corporate tax rate and resistance to the Financial Transactions Tax (FTT), a tax on certain financial transactions such as bonds and derivatives that has been backed by 11 member states. It argues that future bank bailouts should be funded by the FTT. As Angela Merkelâs Christian Democrats prepare for a further round of coalition discussions with the SPD, one possible outcome of a new government formation is that the SPD could assume responsibility for the finance ministry, as was the case in the last CDU-SPD coalition. Yesterday, EU economics commissioner Olli Rehn said Ireland was on track to exit its three year bailout by the end of the year. However, he declined to comment on whether Ireland would need a precautionary credit line to help smooth its passage back to full private market funding. Following todayâs budget, Ireland will submit balance sheet assessments of its three main banks to European authorities for approval before any decision on a precautionary credit line is made. Speaking after the euro group meeting in Luxembourg yesterday evening, EU Commissioner Olli Rehn declined to speculate on the outcome of the tests, but said the Commission was working closely with the Irish Central Bank on the review. With discussions set to intensify between the Government and the troika following todayâs budget, the balance sheet assessments of Bank of Ireland, AIB and Permanent TSB are the main remaining milestone for the State as it seeks to exit its three-year bailout in December.

Wolves appoint Hoddle as manager Wolves appoint Hoddle as manager Glenn Hoddle will be unveiled as the new Wolves manager on Tuesday. The club have confirmed that the former England coach will be unveiled as the successor to Dave Jones at a news conference at Molineux at 1100 GMT. Hoddle has been linked with a return to former club Southampton but Wolves have won the race for his services. He has been out of the game since being sacked at Spurs in September 2003 and worked alongside Wolves caretaker boss Stuart Gray at Southampton. Hoddle began his managerial career as player-boss with Swindon before moving on to Chelsea and then taking up the England job. His spell in charge of the national side came to an end after the 1998 World Cup when he made controversial remarks about the disabled in a newspaper interview. The 47-year-old later returned to management with Southampton, where he again succeeded Jones - as he has now done at Wolves. He engineered an upturn in Saints' fortunes before being lured to White Hart Lane by Tottenham - the club where he made his name as a player. That relationship turned sour at the start of the last campaign and he left the London club early last season. Since then he has applied unsuccessfully for the post of France manager and had also been linked with a return to Southampton. Wolves are currently 17th in the Championship and have a home game against Millwall on Tuesday.
Working hours of junior doctors unsustainable Working hours of junior doctors unsustainable The law is clear and current rostering practices are clearly in violation of it âHealth and safety legislation requires employers to ensure, as far as practicable, both safe places and safe systems of work. It is difficult to see how requiring staff to work in excess of 24-hour shifts, on a regular basis, can sit easily with this duty.â Alicia Compton In the face of action planned for tomorrow, junior doctors are considering HSE proposals for hospital rosters in compliance with working time regulations. Our stretched public health system is expected to give around-the-clock care, but can an adequate service be provided in compliance with the EU working time directive and our domestic implementing legislation? Let us look at the culture of long working hours and the challenges of meeting healthcare needs within the constraints of working time legislation. The Marine Casualty Investigation Board report on the 2012 Tit Bonhomme tragedy, in which five fishermen lost their lives in west Cork, stated that insufficient rest time for the crew was the overriding causal factor to the accident. In the 40 hours that the vessel was at sea, crew members had at most four to five hours of sleep. This was found to have had a detrimental effect on watch-keeping arrangements. The investigation boardâs recommendations included that the Minister for Transport enforce the working time regulations for workers on fishing vessels. Spectrum Fatal incidents represent the extreme end of the consequences of long working hours. However, possible adverse effects cover the spectrum. Research indicates that a lack of rest causes work accidents, adversely affects the wellbeing of workers and is simply counter-productive. When the European Commission originally proposed to legislate for working time, it did so on the basis that work fatigue sets in after eight hours and that working more than 50 hours a week has adverse consequences. The regulation of working time thus began at EU level in 1993 and was followed by Irish implementing measures in 1997 with the Organisation of Working Time Act. The working week is limited to 48 hours, averaged over reference periods of four, six or 12 months, depending on the sector or local agreement. Minimum rest periods between shifts apply and workers are entitled to one day off in every seven or two in every 14. Initially, the legislation did not cover junior doctors. Specific, incremental regulations for doctors in training came into force in 2004 which limited the working week to 58 hours, averaged over a year, until 2007. This was reduced to 56 hours to apply until 2009 and thereafter, training doctorsâ hours were capped at an averaged 48-hour week. Working time includes hours during which doctors are on call, as they are at the disposal of their employer and this covers periods in which the doctor is provided with a room and a bed. The law is clear and current rostering practices are clearly in violation of it. Health and safety legislation requires employers to ensure, as far as practicable, both safe places and safe systems of work. It is difficult to see how requiring staff to work in excess of 24-hour shifts, on a regular basis, can sit easily with this duty. Compliance The Irish Medical Organisation wants an end to shifts over 24 hours and calls for a move towards compliance with the working time directive by the end of 2014. Formal notice from the European Commission of Irelandâs disregard for working time rules was first sent in November 2009. This was followed by a reasoned opinion by the European Commission in 2011 regarding Irelandâs non-compliance with the directive. The Department of Health submitted a plan to the commission in 2012 on how to deal with the issue. The IMO has lodged a formal complaint and argues that continuing breaches could lead to the State facing substantial fines in infringement proceedings. Of the estimated 4,000 junior doctors in Irish hospitals, about 1,800 are reported to be unionised and the threatened strike action evidences their unwillingness to sustain what the organisation has referred to as âdangerously long working hoursâ. The potential effects for the public of industrial unrest among our hospital personnel overshadows wider issues â in particular, the repercussions, in terms of mental and physical health and work-life balance, for workers who consistently work punishing hours.

Yahoo celebrates a decade online Yahoo celebrates a decade online Yahoo, one of the net's most iconic companies, is celebrating its 10th anniversary this week. The web portal has undergone remarkable change since it was set up by Stanford University students David Filo and Jerry Yang in a campus trailer. The students wanted a way of keeping track of their web-based interests. The categories lists they devised soon became popular to hundreds of people and the two saw business potential in their idea. Originally dubbed "Jerry's Guide to the World Wide Web" the firm adopted the moniker Yahoo because the founders liked the dictionary definition of a yahoo as a rude, unsophisticated, uncouth person. The term was popularised by the 18th Century satirist Jonathan Swift in his classic novel, Gulliver's Travels. "We were certainly not sophisticated or civilised," Mr Yang told reporters ahead of the anniversary, which will be officially recognised on 2 March. They did have business brains however, and in April 1995 persuaded venture capitalists Sequoia Capital, which also invested in Apple Computer and Cisco Systems, to fund Yahoo to the tune of $2m (Â£1.04m). A second round of funding followed in the autumn and the company floated in April 1996 with less than 50 employees. Now the firm employs 7,600 workers and insists its dot com culture of "work hard, play hard" still remains. It is one of just a handful of survivors of the dot-com crash although it now faces intense rivalry from firms such as Google, MSN and AOL. Jerry Yang, who remains the firm's "Chief Yahoo", is proud of what the company has achieved. "In just one decade, the internet has changed the way consumers do just about everything - and it's been a remarkable and wonderful experience," he said. Through it all, we wanted to build products that satisfied our users wants and needs, but it's even more than that - it's to help every one of us to discover, get more done, share and interact."

A US government default could cause financial catastrophe A US government default could cause financial catastrophe â... We donât have a sane political system; we have a system in which a substantial number of Republicans believe they can force president Barack Obama to cancel health reform by threatening a government shutdown, a debt default, or both...â Images This may be the way the world ends â not with a bang but with a temper tantrum. Okay, a temporary US government shutdown â which became almost inevitable after the House vote to provide government funding only on unacceptable conditions â wouldnât be the end of the world. But a US government default, which will happen unless Congress raises the debt ceiling soon, might cause financial catastrophe. Unfortunately, many Republicans either donât understand this or donât care. Letâs talk first about the economics. After the government shutdowns of 1995 and 1996, many observers concluded that such events, while clearly bad, arenât catastrophes: essential services continue, and the result is a major nuisance but no lasting harm. Thatâs still partly true, but itâs important to note that the Clinton-era shutdowns took place against the background of a booming economy. Today we have a weak economy, with falling government spending one main cause of that weakness. A shutdown would amount to a further economic hit, which could become a big deal if it went on for a long time. Still, a shutdown looks benign compared with the possibility that Congress might refuse to raise the debt ceiling. First of all, hitting the ceiling would force a huge, immediate spending cut, almost surely pushing America back into recession. Beyond that, failure to raise the ceiling would mean missed payments on existing US government debt. And that might have terrifying consequences. Why? Financial markets have long treated US bonds as the ultimate safe asset; the assumption that the US will always honour its debts is the bedrock on which the worldâs financial system rests. In particular, Treasury bills â short-term US bonds â are what investors demand when they want absolutely solid collateral against loans. Treasury bills are so essential for this role that in times of severe stress they sometimes pay slightly negative interest rates, that is, they are treated as being better than cash. Now suppose it became clear that US bonds werenât safe, that the US couldnât be counted on to honour its debts after all. Suddenly, the whole system would be disrupted. Maybe, if we were lucky, financial institutions would quickly cobble together alternative arrangements. But it looks quite possible that default would create a huge financial crisis, dwarfing the one set off by the failure of Lehman Brothers five years ago. No sane political system would run this kind of risk. But we donât have a sane political system; we have a system in which a substantial number of Republicans believe they can force president Barack Obama to cancel health reform by threatening a government shutdown, a debt default, or both, and in which Republican leaders who know better are afraid to level with the partyâs delusional wing. For they are delusional, about both the economics and the politics. On the economics: Republican radicals generally reject the scientific consensus on climate change; many of them reject the theory of evolution too. So why expect them to believe expert warnings about the dangers of default? Sure enough, they donât: the GOP caucus contains a significant number of âdefault deniersâ. Meanwhile, on the politics, reasonable people know Obama wonât let himself be blackmailed, and not just because health reform is his key policy legacy. After all, once he starts making concessions to people who threaten to blow up the world economy unless they get what they want, he might as well tear up the constitution. But Republican radicals â and even some leaders â still insist that Obama will cave in to their demands. So how does this end? The votes to fund the government and raise the debt ceiling are there, and always have been: every Democrat in the House would vote for the necessary measures, and so would enough Republicans. The problem is that GOP leaders, fearing the wrath of the radicals, havenât been willing to allow such votes. What would change their minds? Ironically, considering who got us into our economic mess, the most plausible answer is Wall Street â that the big money will tell Republican leaders that they have to put an end to the nonsense. But what if even the plutocrats lack the power to rein in the radicals? In that case, Obama will either let default happen or find some way of defying the blackmailers, trading a financial crisis for a constitutional crisis. This all sounds crazy, because it is. But the craziness, ultimately, resides not in the situation but in the minds of our politicians and the people who vote for them. Default is not in our stars, but in ourselves. .

Adriano's Chelsea link rejected Adriano's Chelsea link rejected Adriano's agent Gilmar Rinaldi has insisted that he has had no contact with Chelsea over the striker. Chelsea were reported to have made inquiries about Inter Milan's 22-year-old Brazilian star. Rinaldi told Online News Sport from Rio de Janeiro: "I can assure you that Chelsea have had no dealings whatsoever with either me or Adriano. "Parma and Real Madrid are interested but there's nothing new there. Their interest has been known for some time." Adriano has scored 14 goals in 20 Serie A appearances this season. And Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho had claimed that he was in Milan talking to Adriano on the day he is alleged to have held a clandestine meeting with Arsenal defender Ashley Cole. Mourinho said he was "just practising my Portuguese with him because I don't need strikers". Rinaldi told Online News Sport: "I have to say that nobody from Chelsea or any other London club has contacted me. "If they want to, that's fine. I can tell them what the situation is. "If Chelsea are interested then they must make an offer." Inter are reported to have slapped a price tag in the region of Â£40m on the head of Adriano, who joined them just over a year ago from Parma. Real Madrid view him as a natural replacement for compatriot Ronaldo. But Rinaldi said: "I cannot give you a price that Inter would accept for Adriano. That's something that would have to be negotiated between the interested clubs." Comments are closed for this article.
Alcatel-Lucent plans to reduce 14 per cent of its global workforce Alcatel-Lucent plans to reduce 14 per cent of its global workforce Pressure on equipment prices and slower investment from European carriers, along with competition from Chinaâs Huawei Technologies, is forcing Paris-based network giant Alcatel-Lucent to restructure. Alcatel-Lucent plans to reduce staff by 10,000 as chief executive officer Michel Combes moves forward with cost cuts to turn around the unprofitable French network-equipment maker. The cuts represent about 14 per cent of Alcatel-Lucentâs workforce worldwide, based on the 72,000 employees the Paris- based company has. About 4,100 jobs will be cut in Europe, Middle East and Africa, 3,800 in Asia and 2,100 in the Americas, the company said today in a statement. Alcatel-Lucent employs about 130 people at its Irish operation in Blanchardstown, Dublin, according to www.top1000.ie . Alcatel-Lucent is accelerating a turnaround bid after thousands of earlier job cuts, restructuring and asset sales failed to stem losses. Pressure on equipment prices and slower investment from European carriers, along with competition from Chinaâs Huawei Technologies, are forcing Alcatel-Lucent and rivals such as Nokia Oyjâs network-gear unit to reduce staff. âThis is something Alcatel needed to do,â said Eric Beaudet, an analyst at Natixis Securities in Paris, who recommends buying Alcatel-Lucent shares. âThe magnitude of the plan is big and shows the managementâs resolve in rapidly executing its turnaround.â A slimmer organisation could make Alcatel-Lucent more attractive target for an acquirer. Nokia, set to become a manufacturer focusing on wireless networks after the sale of its handset business, is understood to be evaluating a linkup with Alcatel-Lucent. Alcatel-Lucent rose 0.4 per cent to â¬2.89 yesterday in Paris. The stock has almost tripled this year, though it is still down more than 90 per cent since its peak. lcatel-Lucent is following in the footsteps of competitor Nokiaâs network unit, NSN, which in late 2011 started a savings program to cut 17,000 positions, or about 23 percent of its total. The Finnish company has since cut more positions, in excess of 20,000 during the past two years. Cisco Systems , the worldâs biggest maker of networking equipment, said in August itâs cutting about 5 per cent of its workforce. Online News Comments are closed for this article.
Anti-austerity demonstrators jeer, heckle and throw coins at troika inspectors Anti-austerity demonstrators jeer, heckle and throw coins at troika inspectors Protesters scuffle with policemen as they stand guard in order to secure the departure of inspectors from the finance ministry in Athens yesterday. REUTERS/John Kolesidis Only hours before, the Greek prime minister, Antonis Samaras , had resolutely declared that Greece was not at war with the international bodies keeping the debt-stricken country afloat. Yesterday inspectors representing those organisations may have been forgiven for thinking otherwise. In scenes not witnessed since the beginning of Greeceâs economic crisis, auditors from the European Union and International Monetary Fund came face-to-face with the full force of anti-austerity anger as protesters in Athens jeered, heckled and stopped them from leaving the finance ministry. Held back by riot police brought in to guard the department, furious demonstrators screamed âtake your bailout and get out of hereâ as the officials left a first round of talks with the finance minister, Yannis Stournaras . The IMFâs mission chief to Greece, Poul Thomsen , was forced to duck as a man threw a barrage of coins at him. As the Dane was pushed into a waiting car, the protester was dispatched to Greeceâs central police headquarters. Emergency exit Later in the day, the inspectors had to be whisked out of the building through an emergency exit when irate Greeks blocked the main entrance. The protests come on the eve of a general strike and amid spiralling tensions between Athens and the troika, which have propped up the Greek economy to the tune of â¬240 billion since May 2010. Mired in a sixth straight year of recession, with unemployment nudging 30 per cent, Greece has been hit by record levels of poverty â the price of making the biggest fiscal adjustment of any OECD state since the second World War. Many of the demonstrators told reporters they had been directly affected by public sector dismissals demanded by the EU, IMF and European Central Bank . The prospect of yet more austerity measures being meted out to plug a looming fiscal gap has sent passions rising further. Spending cuts Relentless spending cuts and tax rises have resulted in Greeks losing 40 per cent of their disposable income since the crisis began, according to Mr Samaras, who took to the airwaves ahead of the troikaâs latest inspection tour. âBoth Greek society and the economy cannot afford any more measures,â the leader said in his first televised interview since assuming office 15 months ago. âEveryone has to understand that.â Yesterdayâs meetings follow weeks of angry exchanges between Greek officials and creditors over the extent of the funding gap. While Athens contends it is about â¬500 million, and can be easily filled with the application of âtargeted measuresâ and structural reforms, lenders say it is at least four times bigger and will require extra budget cuts to be resolved. The meetings kept well clear of the issue, insiders said. There was much speculation that the troika might not visit at all because of the standoff. On Monday, Mr Samaras reminded Greeks that the country was in negotiation with its lenders, not at war with them.â (Online News News and Media 2013) Return to results
Beckham rules out management move Beckham rules out management move Real Madrid midfielder David Beckham has no plans to become a manager when his playing career is over. "I am not interested in being a coach but I would like to have football schools," the England captain said on television station Canal Plus. "I have wanted to do that since I went to the Bobby Charlton school. I'm going to open one in London and one in LA. "My second passion is charity work - I am an ambassador for Unicef and it gives me great pride." But Beckham revealed that his immediate priority was winning the Spanish league title with Real Madrid. Real slipped to 13 points behind leaders Barcelona with a 1-0 defeat at the hands of Sevilla on Wednesday. Beckham admitted: "It's disappointing and frustrating to see the results, considering the team we have. "I would really like to win La Liga with Real Madrid - I have been here two years and we still have not done it." In a wide-ranging interview, Beckham also revealed that his sending-off against Argentina - and the resulting media storm - had been the most significant moment in his career. Asked for his worst memory, he said: "To be sent off against Argentina - it was not for the sending-off but for what happened afterwards. "I was lucky because I had a manager, Sir Alex Ferguson, who supported me and a strong family behind me but I believe that changed me. "I believe it changed me for the better."

Broadband fuels online change Broadband fuels online change Fast web access is encouraging more people to express themselves online, research suggests. A quarter of broadband users in Britain regularly upload content and have personal sites, according to a report by UK think-tank Demos. It said that having an always-on, fast connection is changing the way people use the internet. More than five million households in the UK have broadband and that number is growing fast. The Demos report looked at the impact of broadband on people's net habits. It found that more than half of those with broadband logged on to the web before breakfast. One in five even admitted to getting up in the middle of the night to browse the web. More significantly, argues the report, broadband is encouraging people to take a more active role online. It found that one in five post something on the net everyday, ranging from comments or opinions on sites to uploading photographs. "Broadband is putting the 'me' in media as it shifts power from institutions and into the hands of the individual," said John Craig, co-author of the Demos report. "From self-diagnosis to online education, broadband creates social innovation that moves the debate beyond simple questions of access and speed." The Demos report, entitled Broadband Britain: The End Of Asymmetry?, was commissioned by net provider AOL. "Broadband is moving the perception of the internet as a piece of technology to an integral part of home life in the UK," said Karen Thomson, Chief Executive of AOL UK, "with many people spending time on their computers as automatically as they might switch on the television or radio." According to analysts Nielsen//NetRatings, more than 50% of the 22.8 million UK net users regularly accessing the web from home each month are logging on at high speed They spend twice as long online than people on dial-up connections, viewing an average of 1,444 pages per month. The popularity of fast net access is growing, partly fuelled by fierce competition over prices and services. Comments are closed for this article.
Broadband in the UK growing fast Broadband in the UK growing fast High-speed net connections in the UK are proving more popular than ever. BT reports that more people signed up for broadband in the last three months than in any other quarter. The 600,000 connections take the total number of people in the UK signing up for broadband from BT to almost 3.3 million. Nationally more than 5 million browse the net via broadband. Britain now has among the highest number of broadband connections throughout the whole of Europe. According to figures gathered by industry watchdog, Ofcom, the growth means that the UK has now surpassed Germany in terms of broadband users per 100 people. The UK total of 5.3 million translates into 7.5 connections per 100 people, compared to 6.7 in Germany and 15.8 in the Netherlands. The numbers of people signing up to broadband include those that get their service direct from BT or via the many companies that re-sell BT lines under their own name. Part of the surge in people signing up was due to BT stretching the reach of ADSL - the UK's most widely used way of getting broadband - beyond 6km. Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line technology lets ordinary copper phone lines support high data speeds. The standard speed is 512kbps, though faster connections are available. "This breakthrough led to a dramatic increase in orders as we were suddenly able to satisfy the pent-up demand that existed in many areas," said Paul Reynolds, chief executive of BT Wholesale which provides phone lines that other firms re-sell. BT Retail, which sells net services under its own name, also had a good quarter and provided about 30% of the new broadband customers. This was a slight increase on the previous three months. Despite the good news about growth in broadband, figures from telecommunications regulator Ofcom show that BT faces increasing competition, and dwindling influence, in other sectors. Local Loop Unbundling, (LLU), in which BT rivals install their hardware in exchanges and take over the line to a customer's home or office, is growing steadily. Cable & Wireless and NTL have announced that they are investing millions to start offering LLU services. By the end of September more than 4.2 million phone lines were using so-called Carrier Pre-Section (CPS) services, such as TalkTalk and One.Tel, which route phone calls across non-BT networks from a local exchange. There are now more than 300 different firms offering CPS services and the percentage of people using BT lines for voice calls has shrunk to 55.4%. Comments are closed for this article.
Broadband steams ahead in the US Broadband steams ahead in the US More and more Americans are joining the internet's fast lane, according to official figures. The number of people and business connected to broadband jumped by 38% in a year, said the US Federal Communications Commission (FCC). In a report, it said there were more than 32 million broadband connections by the end of June 2004. But the US is still behind compared to other nations, ranked 13th in the world by a UN telecoms body. During his 2004 re-election campaign, President George W Bush pledge to ensure that affordable high-speed net access would be available to all Americans by 2007. According to the report by the FCC, broadband is becoming increasingly popular, with people using it for research and shopping, as well as downloading music and watching video. The total number of people and businesses on broadband rose by to 32.5 million in the year ending June 2004, compared to 23.5 million in June 2003. Whereas in the UK, most people hook up to broadband via Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line (ADSL) technology which lets ordinary copper phone lines support high data speeds. But in the US, cable leads the way, accounting for 18.6 million lines. Broadband over the phone line makes up 11.4 million connections, according to the FCC figures. Return to results
Cantona issues Man Utd job hint Cantona issues Man Utd job hint Former Manchester United star Eric Cantona would consider returning to the club as manager one day. But the Frenchman, who made 191 United appearances, would not come back if he felt he could not be creative. "I will not return in the near future," he told MUTV. "If I come back I will need to be involved in football for two or three years because things change. "I do not want to be a manager like everybody else, playing the same system. I want to create something." Cantona says that he would like to follow in the footsteps of Johan Cruyff, who was an innovative coach when he led Barcelona to European Cup glory in 1992. "I remember the 1970s with Ajax and after that Cruyff as a manager at Barcelona," Cantona added. "It was a new system. "It is like in music - when you are a rock star and create something new." The 38-year-old also stated that he is against American tycoon Malcolm Glazer's attempt to take over the club. "I am against this kind of thing because I am like a child - I am a dreamer. I don't want these kind of people to come here," he said. "If it is not Manchester United, if it is not a club where he can earn so much money, do you think he would love to come?" Meanwhile, Cantona is at the centre of a storm after using an obscenity on MUTV on Sunday. Cantona was appearing on a show where supporters quiz guests and it was broadcast at 5.30pm. United apologised but have insisted that they have yet to receive a single complaint about Cantona's comments. Comments are closed for this article.
Childrenâs art and stories feature in book on farm safety Childrenâs art and stories feature in book on farm safety Coveney says childrenâs contributions show how great - and dangerous - farm life can be HSA chief executive Martin OâHalloran said the 86 children who contributed to Only a Giant Can Lift a Bull were among 9,500 children who entered in the farm safety competition. Photograph: Matt Kavanagh/The Online News As many as 86 children have contributed to a new childrenâs book on farm safety launched today by Minister for Agriculture Simon Coveney . Only a Giant Can Lift a Bull is a mix of stories and artwork, all aiming to raise awareness of farm safety. It will be sent to every primary school and county library in the State by the Health and Safety Authority (HSA) in a bid to reduce the number of deaths on farms. Four children were among the 16 deaths on farms this year. Mr Coveney said the childrenâs stories and art showed how great farming life was - but also how dangerous farms could be. âAnd many have witnessed their parents, grandparents and others take risks and suffer the awful consequences,â he said. âI am calling on farmers to take more responsibility, and stop taking unnecessary risks, for their own sake and for the sake of the next generation.â HSA chief executive Martin OâHalloran said the 86 children who contributed were among 9,500 children who entered in the farm safety competition. â Their stories are funny, moving and life-affirming. Some have written about lessons learnt the hard way. Itâs time now to heed this new generation,â he said. âI would appeal directly to all adults working on farms, particularly parents and grandparents, to think about the example they are showing to children and young people and to always find a way to work safely. âWe need to see a change of mindset amongst some farmers now, to ensure we donât create a new generation of risk-takers in farming.â Comments are closed for this article.
Coach Ranieri sacked by Valencia Coach Ranieri sacked by Valencia Claudio Ranieri has been sacked as Valencia coach just eight months after taking charge at the Primera Liga club for the second time in his career. The decision was taken at a board meeting following the side's surprise elimination from the Uefa Cup. "We understand, and he understands, that the results in the last few weeks have not been the most appropriate," said club president Juan Bautista. Former assistant Antonio Lopez will take over as the new coach. Italian Ranieri took over the Valencia job in June 2004 having been replaced at Chelsea by Jose Mourinho. Things began well but the Spanish champions extended their winless streak to six after losing to Racing Santander last weekend. That defeat was then followed by a Uefa Cup exit at the hands of Steaua Bucharest. Ranieri first took charge of Valencia in 1997, guiding them to the King's Cup and helping them to qualify for the Champions League. The 54-year-old then moved to Atletico Madrid in 1999, before joining Chelsea the following year. Comments are closed for this article.
Confusion over high-definition TV Confusion over high-definition TV Now that a critical mass of people have embraced digital TV, DVDs, and digital video recorders, the next revolution for TV is being prepared for our sets. In most corners of TV and technology industries, high-definition (HDTV) is being heralded as the biggest thing to happen to the television since colour. HD essentially makes TV picture quality at least four times better than now. But there is real concern that people are not getting the right information about HD on the High Street. Thousands of flat panel screens - LCDs (liquid crystal displays), plasma screens, and DLP rear-projection TV sets - have already been sold as "HD", but are in fact not able to display HD. "The UK is the largest display market in Europe," according to John Binks, director of GfK, which monitors global consumer markets. But, he added: "Of all the flat panel screens sold, just 1.3% in the UK are capable of getting high-definition." There are 74 different devices that are being sold as HD but are not HD-ready, according to Alexander Oudendijk, senior vice president of marketing for satellite giant Astra. They may be fantastic quality TVs, but many do not have adaptors in them - called DVI or HDMI (High-Definition Multimedia Interface) connectors - which let the set handle the higher resolution digital images. Part of this is down to lack of understanding and training on the High Street, say industry experts, who gathered at Bafta in London for the 2nd European HDTV Summit last week. "We have to be careful about consumer confusion. There is a massive education process to go through," said Mr Binks. The industry already recognised that it would be a challenge to get the right information about it across to those of us who will be watching it. Eventually, that will be everyone. The Online News is currently developing plans to produce all its TV output to meet HDTV standards by 2010. Preparations for the analogue switch-off are already underway in some areas, and programmes are being filmed with HD cameras. BSkyB plans to ship its first generation set-top boxes, to receive HDTV broadcasts, in time for Christmas. Like its Sky+ boxes, they will also be personal video recorders (PVRs). The company will start broadcasts of HDTV programmes, offering them as "premium channel packages", concentrating, to start with, on sports, big events, and films, in early 2006. But the set-top box which receives HDTV broadcasts has to plug into a display - TV set - that can show the images at the much higher resolution that HD demands, if HDTV is to be "real". By 2010, 20% of homes in the UK will have some sort of TV set or display that can show HD in its full glory. But it is all getting rather confusing for people who have only just taken to "being digital". As a result, all the key players, those who make flat panel displays, as well as the satellite companies and broadcasters, formed a HD forum in 2004 to make sure they were all talking to each other. Part of the forum has been concerned with issues like industry standards and content protection. But it has also been preoccupied with how to help the paying public know exactly what they are paying for. From next month, all devices that have the right connectors and resolution required will carry a "HD-Ready" sticker. This also means they are equipped to cope with both analogue and HDTV signals, and so comply with the minimum specification set out by the industry. "The logo is absolutely the way forward," said David Mercer, analysts with Strategy Analytics. "But it is still not appearing on many retail products." The industry is upbeat that the sticker will help, but it is only a start. "We can only do so much with the position we are in today with manufacturers," said Mr Oudendijk. "There may well be a number of dissatisfied customers in the next few months." The European Broadcast Union (EBU) is testing different flavours of HD formats to prepare for even better HDTV further down the line. It is similarly concerned that people get the right information on HDTV formats, as well as which devices will support the formats. "We believe consumers buying expensive displays need to ensure their investment is worthwhile," said Phil Laven, technical director for the EBU. The TV display manufacturers want us to watch HD on screens that are at least 42in (106cm), to get the "true impact" of HD, they say, although smaller displays suffice. What may convince people to spend money on HD-ready devices is the falling prices, which continue to tumble across Europe. The prices are dropping an average of 20% every year, according to analysts. LCD prices dropped by 43% in Europe as a whole last year, according to Mr Oudendijk. Return to results

Doors open at biggest gadget fair Doors open at biggest gadget fair Thousands of technology lovers and industry experts have gathered in Las Vegas for the annual Consumer Electronics Show (CES). The fair showcases the latest technologies and gadgets that will hit the shops in the next year. About 50,000 new products will be unveiled as the show unfolds. Microsoft chief Bill Gates is to make a pre-show keynote speech on Wednesday when he is expected to announce details of the next generation Xbox. The thrust of this year's show will be on technologies which put people in charge of multimedia content so they can store, listen to, and watch what they want on devices any time, anywhere. About 120,000 people are expected to attend the trade show which stretches over more than 1.5 million square feet. Highlights will include the latest trends in digital imaging, storage technologies, thinner flat screen and high-definition TVs, wireless and portable technologies, gaming, and broadband technologies. The show also includes several speeches from key technology companies such as Intel, Microsoft, and Hewlett Packard among others. "The story this year remains all about digital and how that is completely transforming and revolutionising products and the way people interact with them," Jeff Joseph, from the Consumer Electronics Association (CEA) told the Online News News website. "It is about personalisation - taking your MP3 player and creating your own playlist, taking your digital video recorder and watch what you want to watch when - you are no longer at the whim of the broadcasters." Consumer electronics and gadgets had a phenomenal year in 2004, according to figures released by CES organisers, the CEA, on Tuesday. The gadget explosion signalled the strongest growth yet in the US in 2004. Shipments of consumer electronics rose by almost 11% between 2003 and 2004. That trend is predicted to continue, according to CEA analysts, with wholesale shipments of consumer technologies expected to grow by 11% again in 2005. The fastest-growing technologies in 2004 included blank DVD media, Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) TVs, digital video recorders (DVRs), and portable music players. "This year we will really begin to see that come to life in what we call place shifting - so if you have your PVR [personal video recorder] in your living room, you can move that content around the house. "Some exhibitors will be showcasing how you can take that content anywhere," said Mr Joseph. He said the products which will be making waves in the next year will be about the "democratisation" of content - devices and technologies that will give people the freedom to do more with music, video, and images. There will also be more focus on the design of technologies, following the lead that Apple's iPod made, with ease of use and good looks which appeal to a wider range of people a key concern. The CEA predicted that there would be several key technology trends to watch in the coming year. Gaming would continue to thrive, especially on mobile devices, and would reach out to more diverse gamers such as women. Games consoles sales have been declining, but the launch of next generation consoles, such as Microsoft's Xbox and PlayStation, could buoy up sales. Although it has been widely predicted that Mr Gates would be showcasing the new Xbox, some media reports have cast doubt on what he would be talking about in the keynote. Some have suggested the announcement may take place at the Games Developers Conference in the summer instead. With more than 52% of US homes expected to have home networks, the CEA suggested hard drive boxes - or media servers - capable of storing thousands of images, video and audio files to be accessed through other devices around the home, will be more commonplace. Portable devices that combine mobile telephony, digital music and video players, will also be more popular in 2005. Their popularity will be driven by more multimedia content and services which will let people watch and listen to films, TV, and audio wherever they are. This means more storage technologies will be in demand, such as external hard drives, and flash memory like SD cards. CES runs officially from 6 to 9 January. Comments are closed for this article.
Downing injury mars Uefa victory Downing injury mars Uefa victory Middlesbrough boss Steve McClaren hopes that Stewart Downing did not seriously damage his hamstring during the 2-1 Uefa Cup win over Graz AK. The winger was carried off on a stretcher in the closing stages as Boro booked their place in the last 16. McClaren said: "Stewart has tweaked a hamstring, which is a blow for us. We will assess it in the morning. "But I'm delighted with the match result. They say in sport you can win ugly - and we certainly did." McClaren was relieved to make it through after a tough encounter at The Riverside. "To be fair to Graz, they had a gameplan - they knocked the ball forward, especially in the first half, and we struggled to deal with it. "In the second half we were better but it was frustrating because we got the goal - but one slip and they were back in it." Boro face Sporting Lisbon for a place in the quarter-finals after the Portuguese side saw off Feyenoord on Thursday. And McClaren added: "Sporting are technically very good - Portuguese sides always are. "But the journey goes on for us and we will now go to their magnificent stadium - after the first game here - we'll look forward to it." Goalscorer Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink added: "It wasn't a particularly beautiful match to watch - but they made it difficult for us. "We didn't play well at all. But you need a little bit of luck and I think we got that when my shot went through the legs of their goalkeeper. "I would have liked to play in Holland - that would have been a little bit special to me. "But so is going back to Portugal - I'll be playing against some lads I played with at Boavista."

Dr Carol-Anne OâBrien, advocacy co-ordinator for BeLong To Youth Services. Dr Carol-Anne OâBrien, advocacy co-ordinator for BeLong To Youth Services. Ruth O'Connor New research on the mental health of young people has found 6 per cent of heterosexuals questioned had attempted suicide, but 19 per cent of gay or lesbian young people and 24 per cent of young bisexual people had attempted suicide at some point. BeLong To, the national organisation for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgendered young people, welcomed the research which was carried out for Headstrong, the National Centre for Youth Mental Health. âWe werenât surprised at the findings because they confirm previous research in Ireland which shows that LGBT young people are extremely vulnerable to mental health difficulties and that they are particularly at risk in the areas of depression and self-harm,â says Dr Carol-Anne OâBrien, advocacy co-ordinator for BeLong To Youth Services. Concern Dr OâBrien said that while the statistics were most concerning, it was also imperative to stress young LGBT people had support. âIt is important to mention that young people are not alone, that there is a network of services available and that there are important initiatives taking place within the schools. âWe want young people to know that the situation is not hopeless, improvement is happening . . . we see real change, but these young people can feel isolated,â she said. The research drawn from the My World Survey, a national survey examining the mental health of 8,221 young people in Ireland, points to young LGBT people and those unsure of their sexuality as being more at risk of isolation and bullying than others of the same age. People aged between 17 and 25 were asked about their sexual orientation, levels of distress, tendency to self-harm, experience of bullying, disordered eating behaviour and depression. In the anonymous, online questionnaire they were asked about the presence of âOne Good Adultâ whom they could turn to at difficult times. âWorryingly nearly one in four bisexual young people and one in five gay/lesbian young people in this study have at some point made an attempt on their life,â the report states.

Euro zone business recovery weakens in November Euro zone business recovery weakens in November Slipping French business activity weighs on region The survey underlined how lopsided the euro zoneâs recovery from recession is towards growth in Germany, with the rest of the region struggling to sustain momentum. Photograph: Chris Ratcliffe/Online News The fragile recovery in the euro zone private sector weakened unexpectedly this month despite resurgent growth in Germany , as French business activity took a tumble, surveys showed today. Markitâs Eurozone Services Purchasing Managersâ Index (PMI), which gauges business activity across thousands of service sector companies large and small, fell to 50.9 in November from 51.6 last month. It was the weakest reading in three months and undercut even the lowest forecast from 32 economists polled by Online News, although the index held above the 50 line dividing growth in activity from contractions. Overall, the survey underlined how lopsided the euro zoneâs recovery from recession is towards growth in Germany, with the rest of the region struggling to sustain momentum. France in particular, where business activity unexpectedly shrank, was the weakest link in the euro zone this month. âThe French data were a key cause of the decline, but there was also an easing evident in the rest of the region,â said Chris Williamson, chief economist at survey compiler Markit. âOutput outside France and Germany did rise for the fourth month in a row, suggesting the region is returning to growth - but the concern is that the rate of increase we saw in November did slide to the weakest weâve seen in those four months.â Mr Williamson added the survey was consistent with euro zone economic growth of around 0.2 per cent in the current quarter, in line with the latest Online News poll of analysts yesterday. The euro zone economy grew 0.1 per cent from July through September, according to an early official estimate last week. âIt is important to remember that it is still growing,â said Mr Williamson. Order books at services companies, which range from major international banks to high street hairdressers, filled at a roughly unchanged rate compared with last month. Manufacturers fared better this month, helped by the fastest rise in new export orders since May 2011. Markitâs Eurozone Manufacturing PMI rose to 51.5 in November from Octoberâs 51.3. That was its best showing in the five months since factories broke their almost two-year run of declining activity. While output growth slowed marginally, the survey showed factories cut staff at a slower pace this month, with the employment index rising to 49.1 from 48.8. The composite PMI, which combines the manufacturing and services data, slipped to 51.5 from 51.9 last month, undershooting all forecasts in a Online News poll. However, it brought mixed news on inflation pressures. While companies cut prices charged to customers at a faster rate, input prices such as businessesâ energy bills increased at the fastest rate in almost a year. âIt is a concern that companiesâ margins are being squeezed,â said Mr Williamson, although he noted falling prices also reflect improving productivity in euro zone businesses that are trying to cut prices to win business.

Failures âcannot be explained awayâ by poor staffing levels Failures âcannot be explained awayâ by poor staffing levels âNo staffing issue can explain away the lack of basic clinical care that took placeâ for Savita Minister for Health Dr James Reilly: âWe need to change the way weâre working and thatâs a much broader issue than the tragic case.â Inadequate staffing levels in maternity units cannot âexplain awayâ the failure to provide basic care to Savita Halappanavar , Minister for Health James Reilly has said. Dr Reilly was responding yesterday to calls for an immediate increase in the number of consultants and midwives across the Stateâs 19 maternity units in light of the findings of the Health Information and Quality Authority investigation into Ms Halappanavarâs death. The health watchdogâs report, which was published on Wednesday, said: âThe HSE must review its workforce arrangements for maternity services nationally to ensure maternity teams are made up of sufficient numbers of staff with the right mix of skills and deployed effectively both during core and on-call hours.â âTragic circumstancesâ âNo staffing issue can explain away the lack of basic clinical care that took place in the tragic circumstances surrounding Savita Halappanavar,â he said. âIâm not saying we donât need more staff. I believe we will, but I do believe we have an opportunity to change the model of care as well . . .We need to change the way weâre working and thatâs a much broader issue than the tragic case.â Describing the labour ward as a âcritical high-risk area for the pregnant patientâ, the report says: âThis area must involve direct supervision and care by hospital consultant staff and have 24-hours-a-day, seven-days-a-week senior midwifery coverâ. It points out that the 2003 Hanly report concluded there would need to be 191 consultant obstetrician gynaecologists in the State by 2013. At the end of last year, according to the HSE, there were 126. A 2006 report recommended that by 2016 there should be one consultant obstetrician-gynaecologist per 350 births. According to the authorityâs report, in Dublin and mid-Leinster there were 41 consultants and 22,445 births last year, or one consultant per 547 births. In Dublin North East there were 27 consultants and 14,551 births last year, or one per 538. In the HSE South region, there were 17,740 births last year and 31 consultants, or one per 572, and in HSE West, there were 15,606 births and 27 consultants, or one per 578 births. âAppalling indictmentâ Dr Reilly agreed with the characterisation by clinical director of the National Maternity Hospital , Dr Peter Boylan , of Ms Halappanavarâs death as an âappalling indictment of the Stateâs care for patientsâ. Dr Reilly said: âIt is an appalling indictment. But the rationale behind it now needs to be looked at and no amount of staffing can explain away the failure to care for the patient, to do basic things like taking blood pressure, measuring pulse rates, failure to recognise a patient is deteriorating, failing to recognise infection might be the real issue here, failure to follow up a blood test. Staffing [levels] canât explain that.â He said he wanted staffing levels looked at âacross the systemâ and said he wanted âan appropriate level of staffing to an appropriate level of careâ. The Hiqa report pointed to 13 âmissed opportunitiesâ that, had they been identified and acted upon, could have resulted in a different outcome for Ms Halappanavar, who died in University Hospital Galway last October.

Fewer insolvencies in October as rate of start-ups increases Fewer insolvencies in October as rate of start-ups increases But average size of judgments against consumers for bad debt rises, says Vision-net Siac was among the high-profile insolvencies during October The rate of company insolvencies has slowed down, while the number of new business start-ups is increasing, figures from business and credit risk analysts Vision-net show. The number of company failures is a third lower this month than it was in October of last year, with liquidations down 32 per cent to 65 and receiverships halving to 21. A further seven companies sought court protection from their creditors under the examinership process, taking the total number of insolvencies for the month to date to 93. However, the rate at which insolvencies are being declared has eased in recent months, having risen as high as 215 in April 2011. The number of insolvencies in October 2012 was 142. High-profile insolvencies to occur during October include the appointment of an interim examiner to Siac Construction Ltd, while an examiner was appointed to womenâs shoe shop chain Carl Scarpa . Professional services, construction, wholesale and retail, manufacturing and real estate remain the most volatile industries, accounting for almost three-quarters of the company failures recorded so far this month. âGrowing confidenceâ But Christine Cullen , managing director of Vision-net, said the more modest rate of failure for October pointed to the existence of âgrowing confidenceâ within the Irish business community. âThe number of companies failing is reducing significantly and on the other side of the equation the number of new Irish companies now being created is also increasing,â Ms Cullen said. Some 1,069 companies were incorporated in October, up 17 per cent on the same period last year. When newly registered business names are included, there were 2,777 start-ups. This total figure was still up on October 2012, albeit only by 3 per cent. There was one shadow in the shape of higher average debt judgments against consumers who did not repay debts. In the month of September, the average consumer debt judgment rose to â¬103,000, up from â¬63,000 in the same month in 2012. The number of such judgments remained stable at 295, with their total value arriving at â¬30.5 million. Return to results
Finnan says Irish can win group Finnan says Irish can win group Steve Finnan believes the Republic of Ireland can qualify directly for the World Cup finals. After Saturday's superb display in the draw in Paris, Ireland face minnows the Faroe Islands in Dublin on Wednesday. The versatile Finnan, who starred against the French, is confident the group is Ireland's for the taking. "There is a chance for us now to go on, win our home games and why not win the group, even though it's a tough one," said the Liverpool player. Switzerland, Ireland, France and Israel are all now tied on five points from three matches - although the Republic look to have a slight edge after claiming away draws in Basel and Paris. "In Basel we did not play great football, but when you to go to these places the other teams are going to have the majority of the game. "In Paris, we looked good throughout the team and a point was the least we deserved because we had a number of chances. "Looking back, we had an opportunity to get the three points, but we are happy with a point and that will give us confidence going into Wednesday's game. "On paper, we have got the toughest matches out of the way and we have set standards for ourselves. "Automatic qualification is there. It would certainly be good to avoid a play-off, but on the back of a couple of good results I don't see why we can't win the group." Manager Brian Kerr was keen to mention the contribution of Stephen Carr and Finnan on Ireland's right flank at the Stade de France. Finnan's normal position is right-back but he looked assured in a more advanced position against the French. "As I play on the right for my club and being a natural right-back, it was something he (Kerr) looked at because France play strongly down the left-hand side. "So I was happy to play and Stephen Carr and I enjoyed the game, particularly as the defence and midfield held together well and nullified their attacks." Comments are closed for this article.
Five changes the Government are tipped to announce today Five changes the Government are tipped to announce today A revision of the 9 per cent tourism VAT rate: When the VAT rate on restaurants, hotels and other hospitality and tourism sector businesses was reduced by Minister for Finance Michael Noonan in July 2011, it was intended only as a short term measure. The cut from 13.5 per cent to 9 per cent has been credited with supporting thousands of Â jobs, but that could be about to come to an end. The Minister for Finance has indicated that he will be increasing it again in this yearâs budget, although itâs not expected to return to 13.5 per cent. Free GP care for under-fives: The pension cap: The Governmentâs decision to cap tax relief on pensions delivering retirement incomes above â¬60,000 has been well flagged, but this yearâs Budget will provide more detail on exactly how it will work. Whatever the form it takes, the measures are expected to affect about 27,000 people. Reducing job seekersâ allowance again: If the leaks are anything to go by, itâs more bad news for those struggling to get a job. The payment of â¬100 for new entrants under 22 years of age is rumoured to be extended to those under 25, and you will have to be 26 before the full rate kicks in. Incentives for construction: The construction industry has been hard hit since the economic downturn. Lobby groups have been seeking the introduction of some sort of incentive to help rebuild the sector, but how much the minister will give them is not yet clear. There are rumours of tax breaks for homeowners who use reputable contractors for home projects, according to the Irish Independent, and a stimulus package of â¬200 million for capital projects is expected to be announced. .

Further savings can be made in the health system without affecting services to patients, the EU-IMF ... Further savings can be made in the health system without affecting services to patients, the EU-IMF troika has said. The HSE still has some way to go to fully reform the health system and reduce costs to acceptable levels, troika officials advised in a media briefing yesterday. The cost of patented and generic medicines was again singled out by officials as being unacceptably high, despite the measures taken by the Government to reduce costs. Document: Letter to HSE The HSE needs to make further improvements to its financial management system to allow it get a handle on costs, they also said. Significant cost savings could also be achieved through the introduction of a single health identifier for all patients as well as a system of electronic prescription. Officials emphasised the need for Ireland to drive forward a systematic approach to healthcare reform even after Irelandâs programme ends in December. Ultimately, it came to Ireland making choices about where to reduce costs in such a way that services were not affected.

As a result, they say in a letter to HSE director general Tony OâBrien, âunacceptable delaysâ have emerged in accessing treatments for some cancer patients as a result of the overwhelming pressures on services. âParadoxically, the consequences of these quality and safety problems place an even greater long-run financial burden on the hospital system,â the letter from the heads of Our Ladyâs Hospital for Sick Children, Tallaght hospital, St Jamesâs Hospital and the Mater hospital warns. A spokesman for Minister for Health James Reilly said he had already made clear to the HSE a requirement to make patient safety a priority within the service plan. âDespite the hugely competing demands on the service planâs budget, he will not accept an insufficient allocation for measures supporting safe patient care.â The National Cancer Control Programme said it hadnât been contacted by any of the four chief executives about delays in cancer treatment, and it wasnât aware of any acute problems. Delays of up to four days in providing children with cancer treatment were reported yesterday by Owen Smith, an oncologist at Crumlin. Two other big Dublin hospitals did not sign the letter, which was leaked before it reached Mr OâBrien: St Vincentâs, which disagreed with the approach taken by the other institutions; and Beaumont, whose chief executive was away when the letter was being drafted. Service plan The HSE is drawing up a service plan for 2014 which will set out in detail where cuts will be made to services i to meet a spending reduction target of at least â¬666 million, as flagged in the budget last month. There is considerable resistance within the Department of Health, the HSE and hospitals to the level of cuts being demanded. The four hospitals claim they have been doubly impacted by funding cuts resulting from the economic downturn and âdisproportionateâ reductions in the hospitals budget compared to other programmes. As a result, their budgets have been cut by â¬206 million, or more than 20 per cent, since 2009. âEvidence would suggest that these reductions have been determined and applied arbitrarily both to and within the acute sector,â they claim. The chief executives are also critical of Dr Reillyâs plans to introduce a âmoney follows the patientâ model next year.

Further savings can be made in the health system without affecting services to patients, the EU-IMF ... (Update) Further savings can be made in the health system without affecting services to patients, the EU-IMF troika has said. The HSE still has some way to go to fully reform the health system and reduce costs to acceptable levels, troika officials advised in a media briefing yesterday. The cost of patented and generic medicines was again singled out by officials as being unacceptably high, despite the measures taken by the Government to reduce costs. Document: Letter to HSE The HSE needs to make further improvements to its financial management system to allow it get a handle on costs, they also said. Significant cost savings could also be achieved through the introduction of a single health identifier for all patients as well as a system of electronic prescription.

Games win for Blu-ray DVD format Games win for Blu-ray DVD format The next-generation DVD format Blu-ray is winning more supporters than its rival, according to its backers. Blu-ray, backed by 100 firms including Sony, is competing against Toshiba and NEC-backed HD-DVD to be the format of choice for future films and games. The Blu-Ray Association said on Thursday that games giants Electronic Arts and Vivendi would both support its DVD format. The next generation of DVDs will hold high-definition video and sound. This offers incredible 3D-like quality of pictures which major Hollywood studios and games publishers are extremely keen to exploit in the coming year. In a separate press conference at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, Toshiba announced that DVD players for its technology would be on the market by the end of 2005. "As we move from standard definition video images to high-definition images, we have a much greater need for storage," Richard Doherty, from Panasonic's Hollywood Laboratories, one of the pioneers of Blu-ray, told the Online News news website. "So by utilising blue laser-based technology we can make an optical laser disc that can hold six times as much as today's DVD." A Blu-ray disc will be able to store 50GB of high-quality data, while Toshiba's HD-DVD will hold 30GB. Mr Doherty added that it was making sure the discs could satisfy all high-definition needs, including the ability to record onto the DVDs and smaller discs to fit into camcorders. Both Toshiba and Blu-ray are hopeful that the emerging DVD format war, akin to the Betamax and VHS fight in the 1980s, can be resolved over the next year when next-generation DVD players start to come out. When players do come out, they will be able to play standard DVDs too, which is good news for those who have huge libraries of current DVDs. But the support from Vivendi and Electronics Arts is a big boost to Blu-ray in the battle for supremacy. Gaming is a $20 billion industry worldwide, so is as crucial as the film industry in terms of money to be made. "The technical requirement for game development today demands more advanced optical-disc technologies," said Michael Heilmann, chief technology officer for Vivendi Universal. "Blu-ray offers the capacity, performance and high-speed internet connectivity to take us into the future of gaming." EA, a leading games developer and publisher, added that the delivery of high-definition games of the future was vital and Blu-ray had the capacity, functionality and interactivity needed for the kinds of projects it was planning. Sony recently announced it would be using the technology in its next generation of PlayStations. Mr Doherty said gamers were "ravenous" for high-quality graphics and technology for the next generation of titles. "Gamers, especially those working on PCs, are always focused on more capacity to deliver textures, deeper levels, for delivering higher-resolution playback." He added: "The focus for games moving forward is on increased immersion. "Gaming companies really like to focus on creating a world which involves creating complicated 3D models and textures and increasing the resolution, increasing the frame rate - all of these are part of getting a more immersive experience." Fitting these models on current DVD technologies means compressing the graphics so much that much of this quality is lost. As games move to more photo-real capability, the current technology is limiting. "They are thrilled at the advanced capacity to start to build these immersive environments," said Mr Doherty. Currently, graphics-intensive PC games also require multiple discs for installation. High-definition DVDs will cut down on that need. Likewise, consoles rely on single discs, so DVDs that can hold six times more data mean much better, high-resolution games. Blu-ray has already won backing from major Hollywood studios, such as MGM Studios, Disney, and Buena Vista, as well as top technology firms like Dell, LG, Samsung and Phillips amongst others. While Toshiba's HD-DVD technology has won backing from Paramount, Universal and Warner Bros. "The real world benefits (of HD-DVD) are apparent and obvious," said Jim Cardwell, president of Warner Home Video. Mr Cardwell added that rapid time to market and dependability were significant factors in choosing to go with HD-DVD. Both formats are courting Microsoft to be the format of choice for the next generation Xbox, but discussions are still on-going. Next generation DVDs will also be able to store images and other data. CES is the largest consumer electronics show in the world, and runs from 6 to 9 January. Comments are closed for this article.

German officials say coalition discussions did not shape Irish bailout exit German officials say coalition discussions did not shape Irish bailout exit Angela Merkel, Germanyâs chancellor and party leader of the Christian Democratic Union: officials from both the CDU and the SDP said coalition negotiations in Berlin played no role in the decision. Photograph: Krisztian Bocsi/Online News Berlin has denied German domestic politics influenced Irelandâs decision to exit its EU-International Monetary Fund programme without a financial safety net. On Thursday, Fianna FÃ¡il finance spokesman Michael McGrath and John FitzGerald of the ESRI said the lack of a coalition in Berlin had meant the Bundestag was not in a position to back precautionary funding for Ireland. A German government official dismissed this speculation yesterday as incorrect and misleading. âThis was a purely Irish decision and we support and welcome that decision.â In Irelandâs position, Germany would have made the same decision: to take advantage of being fully funded until the end of 2014 to send a signal to markets that Ireland could stand without external assistance, he said. Ongoing coalition negotiations in Berlin played no role in the decision, said officials from both chancellor Angela Merkelâs Christian Democrats (CDU) and its likely coalition partner, the Social Democratic Party (SPD). SPD politicians had attracted attention, ahead of Thursdayâs exit announcement, with critical remarks on Irelandâs corporation tax and Dublinâs demand for retrospective recapitalisation of Irish banks. However senior SPD officials in Berlin with knowledge both of the Irish programme and Berlin coalition negotiations insisted they would not have used a Bundestag vote to delay approval by demanding concessions from Ireland on corporate tax or other issues. âWe would have actually preferred that Ireland went for the precautionary funding, we wouldnât have blocked that,â a senior SPD source said. Officials from the federal government and the SPD denied the lack of a government meant the Bundestag would not have been able to vote on whether to support precautionary funding from the ESM bailout fund. Although the coalition is still under negotiation, the new Bundestag convened on October 22nd. Mr McGrath had said there would have been a âheadache in Berlin if they had to get parliamentary approvalâ for a credit line for Ireland. Comments are closed for this article.
Germany economists warn on ESM bank recapitalisation Germany economists warn on ESM bank recapitalisation Continued high debt levels leave Ireland âvulnerableâ The European Central Bank in Frankfurt. German economists said only limited direct ESM recapitalisations should be allowed when a euro zone banking union is established. Leading German economists have described as âproblematicâ last yearâs June EU summit conclusions allowing direct recapitalisations of euro zone banks by the ESM bailout fund. In their autumn forecast, provided to the federal government yesterday in Berlin, the four economic institutes said Ireland was still vulnerable to shocks because of continued high levels of debt. However the economists said only limited direct ESM recapitalisations should be allowed when a euro zone banking union is established, comprising joint regulation and oversight structures. Before then, a solution must be found for euro zone banksâ existing liabilities â so-called legacy debt which does not drain the bailout fund. âLegacy cases should be solved at the outset through the participation of owners and creditors with resulting restructuring costs nationalised,â wrote the four economic institutes. âShould respective states be overwhelmed, these could be supported by the ESM.â They issued a warning for Berlin to resist pressure from other euro zone member states to rush into activating the banking union. âThere is at present a danger that, given the pressing legacy liabilities in some member states, progress will not be made with the necessary thoroughness,â wrote the economists from four institutes: Munichâs Ifo, Berlinâs DIW, the IWH in Halle and Essenâs RWI. They said Ireland had made the most reform progress among all euro crisis countries and was the only to have passed its jobless peak. âHowever continued high public and private debt levels, as well as existing risks in the banking sector, mean the vulnerability to domestic and external shocks remains high,â it added. Debt deal One of the reportâs authors, Dr Ferdinand Fichtner of Berlinâs DIW, acknowledged that Ireland was viewed by Berlin as a âspecial caseâ among crisis countries. But, given large risks in Spain and elsewhere, he said this did not automatically translate into a special debt deal. âIreland is a special case, in my personal view, because it didnât have the massive problems of competitiveness and, before the financial crisis, had solid finances,â he said. âBut Ireland is also an example of a euro zone country that experienced undesirable developments, from an under-regulated financial sector and large inward capital flows.â Comments are closed for this article.
Germanyâs use of Irish tax advantages must be seen âin the context of the timeâ Germanyâs use of Irish tax advantages must be seen âin the context of the timeâ Former German finance minister âsees the pointâ of Irish people who criticise Germany taking advantage of tax policies it condemned at the same time Keeping Germany posted: under financial pressure in 2005, Germany decided to sell (securitise) a future income stream from the privatisation of its post office in Dublin because Ireland was a centre for securitisation and its tax situation was more favourable The innovative idea came a decade ago. Germany was the sick man of Europe, trapped in a vicious circle of negligible growth and spiralling debt, and getting sicker by the day. The ruling Social Democratic Party (SPD) needed money: fast. After securing a narrow re-election in 2002, then finance minister Hans Eichel revealed that the tax take was down at least â¬30 billion on expectations. Unemployment, up to nearly four million or 10 per cent, was pushing up expenditure at an alarming rate. Emergency budgets were unable to prevent borrowing rising by 64 per cent in 2002 to â¬34.6 billion and by one-fifth the next year to around â¬19 billion. By 2004 Berlin was on its way to its third subsequent budget deficit on the wrong side of the 3 per cent ceiling set down in the EUâs Stability and Growth Pact. Brussels launched an excessive deficit procedure against Berlin, prompting Mr Eichel to sell off state holdings. To generate further cash, he presented a hit list of tax and investment subsidies. But the subsidy cuts were blocked in the the upper house, controlled by the Christian Democratic Union (CDU). Mr Eichel asked investment bank advisors to comb Berlinâs books for other options. That, he says now, was when they stumbled upon the future income from the privatisation of the post office. As part of the privatisation and break-up of the state post office, finalised in 1995, the German state agreed to finance the majority of the legacy pension bill, projected at â¬550 billion by 2090. The new owners would be asked to contribute around â¬20 billion in the future. Mr Eichelâs advisers identified this future income was an asset that could be sold off now â or securitised â with the proceeds flowing into Berlinâs distressed budget. Although, legally speaking, the transaction was completed by the agency charged with managing Bundespost pension fund, sources familiar with the deal say the initiative came from the finance ministry which, in turn, was steered by their banking advisers towards Ireland. âThe banks told us that this kind of business is usually carried out in Ireland,â said one official involved in the transaction. âPerhaps their reason for saying so was the level of expertise there, perhaps tax played a role too. We didnât question it. We just went along with it.â Pressure from Brussels Mr Eichel defends the practice today. Not only was Brussels breathing down his neck, he said, but if total state borrowing exceeded state investment it would, under German law, trigger a budgetary emergency. âSecuritisation is a legitimate practice as long as the assets being used are serious,â said Mr Eichel to The Online News. âWhat happened later was that banks were packaging rotten mortgages and securitising them.â He doesnât remember all the details of the deal but recalls that banking advisers offered a choice of locating the special purpose vehicle to conduct the securitisation in either Ireland, the Netherlands or Luxembourg. âWe could have done this in Germany but Ireland was a centre for securitisation and the tax situation was more favourable,â said Mr Eichel. Mr Eichelâs successor in the finance ministry, Peer SteinbrÃ¼ck, continued the practice. In the end, the securitisation proceeds topped â¬15.5 billion, effectively replacing the stateâs own contributions â and thus state spending â for two years. .

Government deficit restated upwards Government deficit restated upwards Deficit stood at 8.2% of GDP in 2012, up from 7.6% previously reported The government deficit stood at 8.2 per cent of GDP in 2012 - not 7.6 per cent as was previously indicated. The governmentâs deficit in 2012 has been revised upwards due to a restatement in how certain revenues are recorded. In April, the government reported a budget deficit of â¬12,461 million for 2012, down from â¬ 21,358 million in 2011. However, latest data from the Central Statistics Office show that this figure has now risen to â¬13,511 million. As such, when considered as a percentage of GDP, the deficit for 2012 has increased from 7.6 per cent in April, to 8.2 per cent. This remains within the EU/IMF target of 8.6 per cent of GDP. Expenditure fell from â¬76.6 billion in 2011 to â¬69.8 billion in 2012. The restatement largely occured due to a change in when revenue from the sales of mobile phone licences was recorded. Initially, the â¬450 million booked from the sale of mobile phone licenses was reported as having being received in 2012, reflecting the fact that the contract was entered into in 2012. However, Eurostat subsequently clarified that as the date of the allocation of the licences was in the first quarter of 2013, the correct statistical treatment is to record this revenue in 2013. As a result, Irelandâs deficit has increased by â¬723 million. On a gross basis, government debt stood at â¬192,458 million at the end of 2012 - up from â¬169,226 million at the end of 2011. The corresponding percentages of GDP were 117.4 per cent and 104.1 per cent, respectively Latest Economy Return to results
HSE to seek additional â¬199m funding for 2013 HSE to seek additional â¬199m funding for 2013 Health Service Executive set to record overall net deficit of â¬219m for 2013 The deficit is higher than that forecast by Minister for Health James Reilly. Photograph: Eric Luke The HSE will ask the Government to provide an additional â¬199 million in funding for this year. The Online News has learned that the health authority will record an overall net deficit of â¬219 million for 2013. However, about â¬20 million is to be provided to the HSE from a surplus reported in the Department of Healthâs budget for this year. It is expected that Ministers will consider the HSE supplementary estimate at a Cabinet meeting tomorrow. It is also scheduled to be debated at a hearing of the Oireachtas health committee on Thursday. The overall financial deficit is less than the worst-case scenario of â¬286 million which the HSE projected in correspondence to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform several weeks ago. However, it is higher than the deficit for the year of about â¬150 million forecast by the Minister for Health James Reilly following the budget in October. A HSE spokesman declined to confirm the figures for the financial deficit. However, the spokesman said the HSEâs financial out-turn for 2013 was âremarkably good considering certain matters that had arisen over the course of the yearâ. Government policy issues Over the last 12 months the HSE has had to deal with financial pressures generated from a number of issues, particularly Government policy issues, outside of its control. This includes a Government decision not to seek â¬104 million in accelerated payments â essentially payments in advance â from the health insurance industry, as well as delays in introducing legislation to allow for greater scope to charge private patients treated in public hospitals. This measure was to have generated â¬60 million this year, but was deferred until 2014. Separately, a six-month delay by the Government in introducing cuts to the fees of healthcare professionals such as GPs and pharmacists meant that only about half of the â¬70 million target for savings earmarked in this area will be realised this year. The HSEâs budget for this year was also based on the assumption that â¬150 million in savings would flow from the Haddington Road agreement on public-service pay and productivity. However, it is expected to be confirmed this week that there will be a shortfall of â¬50 million on this target. Talks between the HSE, the Department of Health and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on the supplementary funding for this year have been going on in tandem with talks on the controversial service plan for the HSE for 2014. The HSE has been asked to generate savings of â¬666 million next year. A key element of the planned savings is a âprobityâ exercise in relation to medical cards which had a target of realising â¬113 million. In addition, a further â¬20 million in savings was sought in other parts of the budget for primary care services. Service plan The Online News reported at the end of November that HSE director general Tony OâBrien had warned in a letter accompanying the service plan that the scale of cuts envisaged to spending on medical card services was being taken against the advice of both his organisation and the Department of Health. The HSE service plan is being assessed by the Department of Health, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Department of the Taoiseach . Comments are closed for this article.
Health chiefs warn â¬1 billion in cuts needed Health chiefs warn â¬1 billion in cuts needed Additional cuts required if maternity reforms and other initiatives to be funded Senior health figures last night maintained that for many of these initiatives either there was no money available or else funding was only available from once-off sources. MARTIN WALL and PAUL CULLEN Cuts of up to â¬1 billion will be needed in the health service next year - around â¬350 million more than announced in this weeks 2014 Budget - if promised initiatives such as upgrading maternity facilities in the wake of the Savita Halappanavar case are to be implemented, senior health service sources are warning. Senior health figureslast night maintained that either there was no money specially provided or else funding was only available from once-off sources to finance a number of key developments and to deal with service pressures. These included complying with the Galway maternity report, implementing the new deal on working time rules for doctors and providing capacity to deal with increased demands for radiotherapy for cancer patients. Highly-placed health sources maintained that if the cost of these and other initiatives and services had to be met from existing resources, the cuts required in the health budget next year would be in the region of â¬1 billion and not the â¬666 million set out by the Government in the Budget. Separately there is also deepening concern within the HSE about the impact of the Governmentâs controversial move to reduce tax relief on health insurance subscriptions which was also announced in the Budget. Highly placed sources maintained this could destabilise the private health insurance market and pile additional pressure on the public health system. The proposed health spending announced in Tuesdayâs Budget has been the focus of controversy all week, particularly in relation to the â¬666 million ear-marked for health savings in 2014 and the â¬113 million which is supposed to be generated by means of âprobityâ measures in relation to the medical card scheme. Minister for Education Ruairi Quinn has said a âstand-offâ between ministers in relation to medical card spending and the projected savings in health from the Haddington Road Agreement was only resolved last Sunday by an agreement that the figures would be validated by a process involving the Department of the Taoiseach and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform as well as the Department of Health . The concern within health relates to services which are either currently not provided or are provided but funded from once-off sources, and for which no allocation was made in the Budget figures. Demographic pressures such as the ageing of the population and the growth in the birth rate mean that demand for health service is increasing automatically, but a range of new service pressures is also helping to push spending upwards. The recent Hiqa report into the death of Ms Halappanavar drew attention to under-staffing in Irish maternity services and called for a national review of the sector. This will have âresource implications,â the chief executive of the West/North West hospital group, Bill Maher, pointed out yesterday. He said he would be raising the immediate implementation of Hiqaâs recommendations with the HSE and the Department of Health. The deal recently struck with non-consultant hospital doctors (NCHDs) to shorten their working hours will also have significant cost implications for hospitals. The provision of bilateral cochlear implants for profoundly deaf children, described by the Minister for Health James Reilly as one of his top priorities, will cost over â¬12.5 million a year, while similar amounts will be required to fund home care packages for children with significant medical needs. Other areas seen as giving rise to significant extra costs include renal services, living and deceased donor programmes, and the increased demand for radiotherapy. Separately highly-placed sources said there was âdeeping concernâ in the HSE at the Governmentâs decision to cap tax relief on health insurance subscriptions at â¬1,000 for adults, a move which will increase premium costs for hundreds of thousands of people. Sources said this move could generate a âtriple whammyâ for the health service. They forecast it could lead to increased demand on an over-stretched and increasingly under-funded public hospital system next year . Senior health service figures also maintained it could also mean to less income being generated from patients with health insurance who are treated in public hospitals at a time when this amount was scheduled to rise. Sources also maintained that the Government move could adversely affect moves to realised an âacceleratedâ provision of funding from health insurers by the end of the year. .

Highbury tunnel players in clear Highbury tunnel players in clear The Football Association has said it will not be bringing charges over the tunnel incident prior to the Arsenal and Manchester United game. Arsenal's Patrick Vieira had earlier denied accusations that he threatened Gary Neville before the 4-2 defeat. Vieira also clashed with opposing skipper Roy Keane and referee Graham Poll had to separate them. "The referee has confirmed that he is satisfied he dealt with the incident at the time," said an FA statement. It means United's win will pass off without further intervention from the governing body, whose new chief executive Brian Barwick was in the Highbury stands. "I didn't threaten anybody. They are big enough players to handle themselves," said Vieira. "I had a talk with Roy Keane and that's it. Gary Neville is a big lad, he can handle himself. "They just played better than us and deserved to win." Neville admitted there had been incidents before the game, but insisted it had not distracted his focus. "There were a couple of things that did happen before the game which disappoint you," he said. "Especially from players of that calibre, but it's a tough game and we've been around a long time." Neville admitted that he had not enjoyed the match, which was punctuated by fouls and the sending off of Mikael Silvestre for head-butting Freddie Ljungberg . "I thought it was a horrible game in the first half, and it was not much better in the second," he said. "There is no way that should have happened in a football match." After the match, Keane accused Vieira of starting the row. "Patrick Vieira is 6ft 4in and having a go at Gary Neville. So I said, 'have a go at me'," he said. "If he wants to intimidate our players and thinks that Gary Neville is an easy target, I'm not having it." Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson added: "Vieira was well wound up for it. "I've heard different stories. Patrick Vieira has apparently threatened some of our players and things like that." Return to results
Houllier praises Benitez regime Houllier praises Benitez regime Former Liverpool manager Gerard Houllier has praised the work of his Anfield successor Rafael Benitez. Houllier was angry at reports that he has been critical of Benitez since the Spaniard took over at Liverpool. But Houllier told Online News Sport: "In private and in public, I have stressed I believe Rafa is doing a good job. He is the right man at the right place. "Rafa is a good coach and a good man. I've spoken to him since he has been at Liverpool and never criticised him." Houllier also revealed he is now ready to return to the game after leaving Liverpool in May following six years at Anfield. The former France boss has been linked with a host of jobs and pulled out of the race to succeed Mark Hughes as Wales national coach. He has been working for Uefa, covering the Premiership for French television and also coaching in Brazil with national coach Carlos Alberto Perreira. Houllier said: "If a good club comes up at the right time then yes, I am ready to come back. "It has been interesting to watch games from a different perspective and I have learned things. "I have been involved in football since leaving Liverpool and my batteries are recharged." Houllier has been impressed with the quality in the Premiership after watching as a pundit - particularly with Jose Mourinho's work at leaders Chelsea. He said: "Chelsea are doing very well. They have some very good creative players in Damien Duff and Arjen Robben and Didier Drogba showed he can change the face of a game when he came on against Newcastle. "They have got a good team spirit and are strong mentally. They have shown they can cope with all the pressure put on them because of the expectations and cope well with Jose's principles. "Jose had results before he came to Chelsea and I think he will have an impact in the Premiership because he manages his team very cleverly." And Houllier, away from his brief at Liverpool, has been hugely impressed with the Premiership. He said: "It is a very exciting league. It is entertaining, goals are scored and teams are always trying to win. "It has been very interesting to watch the game from a different perspective. "Games switch from end-to-end and there is more pace to the Premiership than other leagues. It is a very good product." Return to results
IMO considers invitation to LRC talks in doctorsâ dispute IMO considers invitation to LRC talks in doctorsâ dispute Kenny urges return to negotiating table as 3,000 doctors protest over working hours The Irish Medical Organisation has said it had received an invitation to attend talks at the Labour Relations Commission on the doctorâs strike tomorrow morning. A spokesman said the IMOâs non consultant hospital doctor committee would meet tomorrow to consider whether or not to accept the invitation. Doctors have called on health chiefs to see sense in the long-running dispute over working hours and avoid a second strike. Fifty-one hospitals were hit by a walk-out by 3,000 non-consultant hospital doctors with pickets placed outside at least eight hospitals for most of the day. Eric Young , IMO assistant director of industrial relations, said its members were united, strong and determined to see this campaign through to a successful conclusion. âWe will continue to try and minimise the impact of this dispute on patients but we must continue the campaign until the HSE sees sense and brings an end to this sorry chapter of the abuse of NCHDs and patients,â he said. The strike began at 7am and will continue until midnight tonight with hospitals operating at a Sunday standard. Scores of doctors picketed the Mater, Beaumont, St Vincentâs and Connolly hospitals in Dublin and outside the capital in Cork University, Tullamore, Portiuncula and the Mercy in Cork. The doctorsâ strike followed weeks of failed negotiations with the HSE over shifts that run for more than 24 hours. Taoiseach Enda Kenny urged the striking doctors to return to the negotiating table. âI would say the place to sort it out is at the Labour Relations Commission â not across the airwaves. Thatâs a tried and tested forum,â he said. Mr Kenny said the commission can resolve the dispute. âI do hope that this will be responded to in a positive fashion and hopefully can be resolved so that, understanding that we want to get to a point at the end of next year where the working time directive is fully implemented in respect of all the doctors and all the hospitals as should be many years ago,â he said. Doctors carried out any required transplant and dialysis service and the normal weekend palliative care and attended for patients undergoing active chemotherapy and radiotherapy which cannot be deferred. They maintained they had received exceptional support from the public and medical colleagues. Mr Young added: âI think everybody has seen that the responsibility for this sad state of affairs rests with the HSE and there has been huge support for our efforts to bring an end to the routine abuse of NCHDs.â Dr John Donnellan, of the Irish Medical Organisation (IMO), blamed the Health Service Executive (HSE) for the withdrawal of services. âResponsibility for this day of action rests fairly and squarely with the HSE who have abused the position of NCHDs for over a decade,â he said. âThroughout that time they have misled doctors, they have broken promises and commitments and they have ignored their obligations under EU law. âAs a result they are presiding over an unsafe working environment where the health of patients and that of our own NCHD colleagues is routinely put at risk.Today we are saying loud and clear â enough is enough we are not taking this any more.â About 12,000 outpatient appointments were cancelled as a result and about 3,000 operations postponed as a result of the strike.

IMO rejects LRC meeting as doctorsâ strike set to go ahead IMO rejects LRC meeting as doctorsâ strike set to go ahead âNo valueâ in accepting an invitation to resume negotiations at the Labour Relations Commission Last month, a ballot for industrial action produced a 97 per cent vote in favour among the 56 per cent of junior doctors who cast votes. A strike of most hospital doctors is set to go ahead next Tuesday following a decision by the Irish Medical Organisation to refuse further talks on the dispute. The IMO said it could see âno valueâ in accepting an invitation to resume negotiations at the Labour Relations Commission because claims made by the HSE about the doctorsâ stance were âblatantly untrueâ. âThe strike is on,â said the IMOâs director of industrial relations, Steve Tweed . âThere has been a complete breakdown in trust and on that basis we cannot sit across the table from the HSE.â The HSE expressed disappointment and called on the IMO to put its proposals to a ballot of all non-consultant hospital doctor members. Last month, a ballot for industrial action produced a 97 per cent vote in favour among the 56 per cent of junior doctors who cast votes. It claimed next weekâs strike was completely avoidable and should be immediately deferred to allow a ballot to take place, âgiven the serious patient care and ethical implications of proceeding with strike action in these circumstancesâ. The HSE had dealt âin a comprehensive mannerâ with all the issues raised by the IMO in relation to achieving a maximum 24-hour shift in hospitals by the end of next month and a had plan for full compliance with the European working time directive by the end of next year, it said. âDespite the complex and challenging matters at issue, significant progress has been achieved during the engagement since September 3rd. The IMO has acknowledged this progress at the LRC and in writing to the HSE.â At issue is the question of what sanctions would apply in cases where hospitals failed to limit shifts to a maximum of 24 hours as provided for under the draft agreement. The HSE says hospitals should be financially sanctioned in cases of non-compliance but it claims the IMO wants doctors to receive additional payment, at a rate of 2Â½ times standard rates, for hours worked over 24 hours. Proposed sanction However, Mr Tweed said the sanction proposed by the IMO was payment at 1Â¼ hours and time off in lieu for doctors who were forced to work over the 24-hour limit. Where this time was not used within three months, it would be paid at the standard pay rate. The strike is likely to cause significant disruption in hospitals. However, emergency, oncology and dialysis services will not be affected. Comments are closed for this article.
Ireland referred to ECJ over junior doctorsâ hours Ireland referred to ECJ over junior doctorsâ hours Brussels says Ireland in breach of EU legislation on work practices in public hospitals Junior doctors picket outside the Mater Hospital in Dublin last month. File Photograph: Cyril Byrne/The Online News Suzanne Lynch, European Correspondent in Brussels Ireland has been referred to the European Court of Justice for its failure to comply with EU working hours legislation regarding the work practices of doctors in public hospitals. The European Commission said this morning that Ireland had failed to ensure that doctors worked no more than an average of 48 hours per week, including overtime, as set out in the European Working Time Directive. According to the commission, there are still ânumerous casesâ where junior doctors in Ireland are regularly required to work continuous 36-hour shifts, to work more than 100 hours in a single week or 70-75 hours on average, and to work without adequate breaks. âThe commission considers this situation a serious infringement of the EUâs Working Time Directive, endangering not only doctorsâ health and safety but also their patients as over-tired doctors risk making mistakes,â the EUâs executive arm said. The decision to refer Ireland to the European Court of Justice follows a number of warnings by the European Commission over the last decade over the working practices of doctors. A letter of formal notice was sent to Ireland in November 2009 outlining concerns, followed by a âreasoned opinionâ in September 2011, issued to both Ireland and Greece warning that failure to implement EU legislation could lead to a referral to the European Court of Justice. The commission said it became aware of the infringement of EU law following national reports on the issue and following a complaint from an Irish doctorâs association. The Irish Medical Organisation has been campaigning strongly on the issue of junior doctor hours, with a one-day strike taking place in early October. A further strike last month was averted following a deal reached at the Labour Relations Commission , which included financial sanctions for hospitals found to be in breach of the EU Working Time Directive. Minister for Health James Reilly said at the time the Government was committed to achieving compliance with the European working time directive in respect of NCHDâs ( Non consultant hospital doctors) by the end of 2014. Dr Reilly said he was âdisappointedâ at the decision to refer Ireland to the ECJ. âI have met with the Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Inclusion, Mr Andor, on two occasions and have used those meetings to emphasise Irelandâs commitment to achieving compliance with this Directive. This remains the position of the Irish Government.â He said he had made the issue a top priority in 2013, and will continue to prioritise the issue until full compliance is achieved. âAlready, good progress has been made in relation to reducing the number of doctors working more than 68 hours per week and the incidence of shifts longer than 24 hours.â On Monday, the mother of a junior hospital doctor who took her own life has described her daughterâs working hours as âimmoralâ following an inquest into her death. Dr Jessica Murphy (26) was found unconscious in her apartment at Exchange Hall in Tallaght, Dublin, on December 1st last year. She was later pronounced dead at Tallaght Hospital, where she was a junior doctor working in neurology. Dublin Coronerâs Court heard she had taken an âoverwhelmingâ overdose of the anti-depressant amitriptyline. Her parents raised the issue of her working hours during the inquest, telling coroner Dr Brian Farrell that she worked 95 hours a week. Following the completion of the inquest, Marian Murphy said her daughter had been âput under too much pressureâ. Return to results
Irish finish with home game Irish finish with home game Republic of Ireland manager Brian Kerr has been granted his wish for a home game as the final World Cup qualifier. Ireland will close their bid to reach the 2006 finals by playing Switzerland in Dublin on 12 October 2005. The Republic met the Swiss in their final Euro 2004 qualifier, losing 2-0 away and missing out on a place in the finals in Portugal. The Group Four fixtures were hammered out at a meeting in Dublin on Tuesday. The Irish open their campaign on 4 September at home to Cyprus and wrap up the 10-match series on 12 October 2005, with the visit of Switzerland. Manager Brian Kerr and FAI officials met representatives from Switzerland, France, Cyprus, Israel and the Faroe Islands to arrange the fixture schedule. Kerr had hoped to finish with a clash against France, but got the reigning European champions as their penultimate home match on 7 September 2005. The manager got his wish to avoid a repeat of finishing their bid to qualify with too many away matches. Republic of Ireland v Cyprus; France v Israel; Switzerland v Faroe Islands.

Irish near top of OECD table for smoking and drinking Irish near top of OECD table for smoking and drinking Report finds Irish have greater propensity towards obesity than people in many other countries The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Developmentâs Health at a Glance 2013 report confirms the serious impact of the recession on health spending. Photograph: Fabrizio Bensch/Online News A major overview of health in Ireland published today shows that the Irish are still near the top of the international league table for smoking and drinking and have a greater propensity towards obesity than people in many other countries. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Developmentâs Health at a Glance 2013 report confirms the serious impact of the recession on health spending which had been growing in Ireland at 7 per cent annually during the boom years between 2000 and 2009. But it fell by 6.6 per cent annually between 2009 and 2011 on a per capita basis, with only Greece experiencing a sharper fall than Ireland. The report says that the fall in Irish spending reflects the substantial reforms undertaken, including cuts to cost of health care, such as wages and pharmaceuticals. Oecd health at a glance 2013 But the report also confirms the encouraging progress made in combating serious illnesses in the last two decades. Deaths due to cancer fell by 21 per cent, ischemic heart disease by 59 per cent and cerebrovascular disease by 54 per cent between 1990 and 2011. In all three instances, the rate of decline was greater than the OECD average. And life expectancy in Ireland has increased by a full four years since 2000 to reach 80.6 today, slightly more than the OECD average of 80.1. Ireland remains more than two years behind the table-topper, Switzerland, where life expectancy is 82.8 years. Drinking Ireland still ranks badly when it comes to smoking, drinking and obesity. Out of 40 countries surveyed, only the Russian Federation, Greece and Chile have a higher proportion of adult daily smokers than Irelandâs 29 per cent. And although this represents a decline of 12 percentage points since the year 2000, the decline is much smaller than in many other countries. However, this smoking data comes from 2007 and therefore may not give a completely accurate picture of current trends. Only five countries out of 40 drink more alcohol than Ireland annually on a per capita basis. Average consumption in Ireland has increased slightly in the last 20 years, compared to the significant reductions recorded in some high-consumption European countries, including France, Austria, Portugal and Spain. .

Joke e-mail virus tricks users Joke e-mail virus tricks users A virus that disguises itself as a joke is spreading rapidly across the net. Anti-virus firms are issuing high-level warnings about the new version of the Bagle e-mail program that seems to be catching a lot of people out. The Windows virus grabs e-mail addresses from Microsoft Outlook and uses its own mail sending software to spread itself to new victims. When it infects a machine, the Bagle variant turns off security measures that usually protect PCs. The new variant is called Bagle.AT, Bagle.BB and Bagle.AU and the attachment bearing the virus code is labelled as either "joke" or "price". The body of the virus usually contains nothing but a smiley or emoticon. The virus can strike computers running Windows 95, 98, ME, NT, 2000 and XP. Users will be infected if they open the attachment that travels with the e-mail. As well as plundering Microsoft Outlook for e-mail addresses to send itself to, Bagle.AT also tries to turn off the firewall and security centre services on Windows XP machines. Online News News Online has received five warnings about the virus from security companies. Finnish company F-Secure gave the virus its second highest threat level. "We've had several reports all over the world," said Mikko Hypponen, director of anti-virus research for F-Secure. Security firm Network Box said that it stopped more than 30,000 copies an hour of the virus as the outbreak reached a peak. Black Spider said it had stopped more than 1 million copies of Bagle.AT since the outbreak began at 0630 BST (0530 GMT). Anti-virus firms urged users to be wary of unexpected e-mail messages bearing attachments and to update their software to ensure they are protected against the latest threats. Return to results
Jump in business activity matched by rise in cost inflation pressure Jump in business activity matched by rise in cost inflation pressure The service sector posted the sharpest expansion in activity, new economic data showed. Photograph: Chris Ratcliffe/Online News The Northâs private sector has posted its sharpest increase in new orders for more than nine years, according to figures just released. The latest Ulster Bank Purchasing Managersâ Index, published this morning, points to the jump in economic activity which it says was the largest since March 2004 and follows five successive months of growth. âThe Northern Ireland economic recovery gathered momentum in November as growth of both activity and new orders accelerated to multiyear highs,â the report said. âThis contributed to a survey record accumulation of outstanding business, although the rate of job creation eased.â It also warned that cost inflation picked up over the past month and remains faster than the UK economy average. The service sector posted the sharpest expansion in activity, with growth also quickening in the manufacturing and construction sectors. The report adds: âWhere activity rose, this was often attributed to a general uplift in the UK economy and subsequent growth of new orders. The rate of expansion in new business in Northern Ireland accelerated sharply over the month and was the fastest since July 2004. New export orders also rose at a quicker pace during November. Richard Ramsey , Ulster Bankâs chief economist in Northern Ireland, said there had been a âmarked accelerationâ in business activity in November and that there were no signs that the pick-up in activity is set to fade. âLooking at the growth in new orders suggests that this momentum is set to continue into 2014,â he said. âLast month, local businesses reported the sharpest increase in new orders in almost nine and a half years with this improvement evident across firms within the manufacturing, construction and services sectors. âThe latter posted the sharpest increase in new orders of all sectors with November representing the service industryâs best month since the credit crunch officially began in August 2007.â Comments are closed for this article.
Junior doctors have voted overwhelmingly to take industrial action over their campaign to reduce âda... Junior doctors have voted overwhelmingly to take industrial action over their campaign to reduce âdangerously longâ working hours. A new bedside blood test for sepsis has the potential to save many thousands of lives, scientists have said. The life-threatening condition is caused by an overwhelming immune reaction to infection that damages tissues and organs. The condition came to public prominence in Ireland during the case of Savita Halappanavar , who was 17 weeks pregnant when she died from sepsis on October 28th last year following a miscarriage. Rapid diagnosis and treatment with antibiotics is essential, but it can take up to two days to analyse samples in a laboratory. Now British scientists have discovered a biomarker in the blood that can identify sepsis at the bedside within two hours. Certain microRNAs, short strands of the genetic molecule RNA, were more likely to be found in the blood of patients with sepsis. MicroRNAs alter the activity of genes and are known to influence disease processes. Professor Graham Lord , director of the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Biomedical Research Centre at Guyâs and St Thomasâ NHS Foundation Trust and Kingâs College London, said: âSepsis is a hidden killer, causing nearly a third of all hospital deaths. Rapid antibiotic treatment for the condition is vital â every minute counts. Yet current diagnostic methods can take up to two days, so an accurate diagnostic test that can be carried out at the patientâs bedside is urgently needed. âWe have for the first time identified a group of biomarkers in the blood that are good indicators of sepsis. We have shown that it is possible to detect these markers by screening a patientâs blood in the ward, a process which can deliver results within two hours. This is an extremely exciting development which has the potential to completely transform the management of this severe disease and save thousands of lives worldwide every year. These are promising early findings, and now we need to test this approach in a large clinical trial.â Initial results from laboratory tests were validated in a large group of Swedish patients with severe sepsis. The research, published in the online journal Public Library of Science ONE, showed that it was possible to diagnose sepsis within two hours with 86 per cent accuracy. Symptoms of sepsis are similar to other types of inflammation affecting the whole body but only sepsis responds to antibiotics. It is important to distinguish sepsis from other forms of Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS), the researchers point out. Administering antibiotics in non-sepsis cases can help to fuel antibiotic resistance. âNot only would an accurate diagnostic test improve outcomes for patients, but it would contribute to tackling the ongoing problem of antibiotic resistance by allowing clinicians to distinguish between SIRS and sepsis and diagnose these severe conditions more accurately,â Prof Lord added. Plans are under way for a randomised clinical trial at Kingâs College London and Guyâs and St Thomasâ NHS Foundation Trust. PA Return to results
Lack of training places for jobless youth apparent Lack of training places for jobless youth apparent Cut to welfare for under-25s was justified on the basis of youth employment initiatives Live Register figures show that during 2012 there were 41,000 people under 25 who were without work for four months or more. During this same time-frame, figures show a total of 18,000 training, education and work-experience opportunities available for young welfare recipients. There will not be enough training or education places available next year for many jobless young people, despite steep welfare cuts aimed at directing them into the workplace, new figures suggest. Last week, the Government announced a reduced jobseekerâs rate of â¬100 a week for under-25s on the basis that it would provide a greater incentive to take up work, training or education supports. However, Youth Work Ireland â a federation of youth services across the State â estimates only half of the places needed will be available. The Department of Social Protection was unable to say yesterday exactly how many places would be provided next year and whether they would be sufficient to meet demand. Live Register figures show that during 2012 there were 41,000 people under 25 who were without work for four months or more. During this same time-frame, figures show a total of 18,000 training, education and work-experience opportunities available for young welfare recipients. Shortfall in schemes âWhatever way you look at it, the numbers next year will fall far short of whatâs required,â said Michael McLoughlin of Youth Work Ireland. âThe result is that young people â who in many cases are doing their best and trying to find work or access training â will be penalised with lower welfare rates.â On budget day last week, Government Ministers said â¬14 million would be provided to roll out a âyouth guaranteeâ scheme over the coming months. This is aimed at providing guaranteed access to work, training and education for any young person out of work for four months or more. Minister for Social Protection Joan Burton pledged the guarantee would direct young people into âgood-quality work, training and educational opportunities for young peopleâ. Yesterday, a spokeswoman for Ms Burton said it was too early to say how many opportunities would be available, but it was âlikely to be significantly up on the figure of 18,000 estimated for 2012â. The department does not have a starting date for when the youth guarantee will come into operation. It says delivery will draw on existing schemes â such as JobBridge, the national internship scheme â along with welfare supports such as the back-to-work and back-to-education allowances. Department officials point out the â¬14 million is only part of the funding available. They say hundreds of millions are being invested in other programmes overseen by the Department of Education. In addition, they say the Department of Jobs and Enterprise provides funding for enterprise development targeted at young people. âThe most important contribution to providing opportunities for young people will come from the Governmentâs policies aimed at promoting economic recovery,â Ms Burtonâs spokeswoman said. âPast experience suggests that youth employment tends to grow more rapidly than overall employment in a recovery period.â EU plan The Government is due to submit a plan to the EU by year end to draw down matching funds for a youth guarantee scheme. This plan will include an additional 1,500 JobBridge places; 1,000 places on TÃºs, a community work placement scheme; and at least 2,000 free training places for under-25s as part of a successor to the Momentum programme this year. .

Microsoft debuts security tools Microsoft debuts security tools Microsoft is releasing tools that clean up PCs harbouring viruses and spyware. The virus-fighting program will be updated monthly and is a precursor to Microsoft releasing dedicated anti-virus software. Also being released is a software utility that will help users find and remove any spyware on their home computer. Although initially free it is thought that soon Microsoft will be charging users for the anti-spyware tool. The anti-spyware tool is available now and the anti-virus utility is expected to be available later this month. Microsoft's Windows operating system has long been a favourite of people who write computer viruses because it is so ubiquitous and has many loopholes that can be exploited. It has proved such a tempting target that there are now thought to be more than 100,000 viruses and other malicious programs in existence. Latest research suggests that new variants of viruses are being cranked out at a rate of up to 200 per week. Spyware is surreptitious software that sneaks on to home computers, often without users' knowledge. In its most benign form it just bombards users with pop-up adverts or hijacks web browser settings. The most malicious forms steal confidential information or log every keystroke that users make. Surveys have shown that most PCs are infested with spyware. Research by technology firms Earthlink and Webroot revealed that 90% of Windows machine have the malicious software on board and, on average, each one harbours 28 separate spyware programs. Before now Microsoft has left the market for PC security software to specialist firms such as Symantec, McAfee, Trend Micro and many others. It said that its virus cleaning program would not stop machines being infected nor remove the need for other anti-virus programs. On spyware freely available programs such as Ad-Aware and Spybot have become widely used by people keen to keep the latest variants at bay. Microsoft's two security tools have emerged as a result of acquisitions the company has made over the last two years. In 2003 it bought Romanian firm GeCAD Software to get hold of its anti-virus technology. In December 2004 it bought New York-based anti-spyware firm Giant Company Software. Last year Microsoft also released the SP2 upgrade for Windows XP that closed many security loopholes in the software and made it easier for people to manage their anti-virus and firewall programs.

Microsoft gets the blogging bug Microsoft gets the blogging bug Software giant Microsoft is taking the plunge into the world of blogging. It is launching a test service to allow people to publish blogs, or online journals, called MSN Spaces. Microsoft is trailing behind competitors like Google and AOL, which already offer services which make it easy for people to set up web journals. Blogs, short for web logs, have become a popular way for people to talk about their lives and express opinions online. MSN Spaces is free to anyone with a Hotmail or MSN Messenger account. People will be able to choose a layout for the page, upload images and share photo albums and music playlists. The service will be supported by banner ads. "This is a simple tool for people to express themselves," said MSN's Blake Irving. This is Microsoft's first foray into blogging, which has taken off as a web phenomenon in the past year. Competitors like Google already offer free services through its Blogger site, while AOL provides its members with journals. Accurate figures for the number of blogs in existence are hard to come by. According to blog analysis firm Technorati, the so-called blogosphere, has doubled every five and a half months for the last 18 months. It now estimates that the number of blogs in existence has exceeded 4.8 million, although some speculate that less than a quarter are regularly maintained. Return to results
Microsoft makes anti-piracy move Microsoft makes anti-piracy move Microsoft says it is clamping down on people running pirated versions of its Windows operating system by restricting their access to security features. The Windows Genuine Advantage scheme means people will have to prove their software is genuine from mid-2005. It will still allow those with unauthorised copies to get some crucial security fixes via automatic updates, but their options would be "limited". Microsoft releases regular security updates to its software to protect PCs. Either PCs detect updates automatically or users manually download fixes through Microsoft's site. Those running pirated Windows programs would not have access to other downloads and "add-ons" that the software giant offers. People who try to manually download security patches will have to let Microsoft run an automated checking procedure on their computer or give an identification number. Microsoft's regular patches which it releases for newly-found security flaws are important because they stop worms, viruses and other threats penetrating PCs. Some security experts are concerned that restricting access to such patches could mean a rise in such attacks and threats, with more PCs left unprotected. But Graham Cluley, senior consultant at security firm Sophos, told the Online News News website that it was a positive decision. "It sounds like their decision to allow critical security patches to remain available to both legitimate and illegitimate users of Windows is good news for everyone who uses the net," he said. Windows Genuine Advantage was first introduced as a pilot scheme in September 2004 for English-language versions of Windows. Microsoft's Windows operating system is heavily exploited by virus writers because it is so widespread and they are constantly seeking out new security loopholes to take advantage of. The company is trying to tackle security threats whilst cracking down on pirated software at the same time. Software piracy has cost the company billions, it says. The company announced earlier in January that it was releasing security tools to clean up PCs harbouring viruses and spyware, which 90% of PCs are infected with. The virus-fighting program, updated monthly, is a precursor to Microsoft's dedicated anti-virus software. Last year it introduced the Windows XP Counterfeit Project, a UK-based pilot scheme, which ran from November to December. The scheme meant that anyone with pre-installed copies of the operating system in PCs bought before November could replace counterfeit versions of Windows XP with legal ones for free. It is also increasing efforts to squash software piracy in China, Norway and the Czech Republic, where pirated software is a huge problem, by offering discounts on legitimate software to users of pirated copies Windows. "China in particular is a problem, with piracy estimated at 92%," said Mr Cluley. Comments are closed for this article.
Minister says profitable health insurers can accept lower profits on policies for younger customers Minister says profitable health insurers can accept lower profits on policies for younger customers Minister for Health James Reilly suggested today that some health insurers were âcherry-pickingâ customers and as a result had lower proportion of older customers than their market share. Photograph: TheOnline News Minister for Health James Reilly has called on insurers to absorb the cost of stamp duty increases and not add them to the health cover premiums of younger people. Yesterday Dr Reilly announced a number of rule changes announced which, coupled with budget reductions in tax relief on premiums, are expected to see premiums increase by approximately 15 per cent. An average family with two children will pay an extra â¬328 in premiums next year as a result of yesterdayâs change and the budget cuts in tax relief, insurer GloHealth estimated. Laya healthcare added that the move would drive more people out of private health insurance. Speaking today Dr Reilly said an average of 60,000 people per annum had abandoned their private health insurance and admitted that in the longer term this was unsustainable. He called on insurers to accept a lower profit margin on their younger, healthier customers and not to pass on the increases to this age group in a bid to prevent them surrendering their policies. Dr Reilly suggested that some insurers were âcherry-pickingâ customers and as a result had a far lower proportion of older customers than their market share. Dr Reilly said VHI had only 55 per cent of the private health insurance market but 80 per cent of the payouts, largely because it had a disproportionally high proportion of elderly customers, and that this was unsustainable. He said the changes were being introduced to protect older people and keep health insurance affordable for them. Fianna FÃ¡il leader Micheal Martin told the DÃ¡il today up to 6,000 people are cancelling their private health insurance each month. âBy the end of this year, in two years alone, we estimate that about 140,000 people will have cancelled health insurance,ââ he added. He claimed that Government policies were driving people out of private health insurance. Laya managing director DÃ³nal Clancy said ârather than protect the most vulnerable patients as outlined by the Minister, the levy hike will only increase the burden on an already struggling public health systemâ. He said the health levy has risen by 149 per cent for an adult since its introduction in 2009 with the rate for children rising 155 per cent. The duty, which is used to fund credits to the various insurers according to the age profile of their customers, is being increased from â¬350 to â¬399 per adult with advanced cover, and â¬120 to â¬135 per child. The change will affect more than 80 per cent of customers who have advanced cover for private and public hospitals. The VHI will benefit most from the changes to credits because it has the highest proportion of older customers. The three privately owned insurers will be hardest hit because their customer base is younger. Dr Reilly said he was reluctant to recommend increases in stamp duty, given the pressures many households face. âHowever, my priority is to direct support where it is most needed and these revised risk equalisation credits will subsidise health insurance for our most vulnerable patients,â he said. GloHealth chief executive Jim Dowdall said: âIt is farcical, bizarre and absurd that the Minister continually calls on health insurers to drive down costs when Government policies have been the overwhelming driver of rising premiums in recent years.â Risk equalisation is the system whereby companies with older customers with higher claims costs are compensated by rivals with a younger client case. Dermot Goode of Cornmarket Healthcare Division said the changes announced by the Minister would have an inflationary effect even though the stamp duty was not levied on consumers, because insurers were likely to pass on the increases. âConsumers are going to get clobbered. Between this and the cuts in tax relief announced in last monthâs budget, itâs likely that premium increases of between 10 and 15 per cent are coming down the line,â he said. Insurances companies are also under pressure to fund an extra â¬30 million a year being demanded by the Department of Health from next year in respect of the use by private patients of public beds in the public health system, he said. Mr Goode estimated that the budget changes added up to â¬270 a year to the cost of the VHIâs Plan B Options policy, and â¬170 to Plan B. Customers on âgold-platedâ plans, as they were called by Minister for Finance Michael Noonan in his budget-day speech, will have to pay an extra â¬470-â¬780 a year. .

Mobile gaming takes off in India Mobile gaming takes off in India Gaming on the move is one of the fastest-growing activities among the tech-savvy in India, says a report. The Indian mobile gaming market is expected to generate about $26m (Â£13.8m) by the end of 2004, according to market analysts In-Stat/MDR. In October, mobile phone users grew by 1.4 million to 44.9 million, overtaking the number of landlines, said the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India. Analysts say cheap rates and a huge youth market is driving the market. India has a large population of under-25s, and many in urban areas are fast adopting mobiles as must-have gadgets. India's mobile gaming market will bring in about $336m (Â£178m) by 2009, according to the report. Mobile gaming is expected to explode globally over the next few years. Analysts predict that 220 million people will be playing games on phones by 2009, generating billions for mobile companies. Services other than just voice calls which are offered by mobile operators in India have, as a result of the huge rise in subscribers, grown significantly and rapidly. "The growth of this market sector has attracted publishers, developers, animators, musicians, and content providers, and is also stimulating the development of innovative business models," said Clint Wheelock, director of In-Stat/MDR's wireless research group. "Mobile gaming is not just about fun; it also represents one key element of a rich mobile entertainment experience for consumers, and a lucrative market opportunity for industry players." Currently, India has six big games developers and four mobile operators that offer games to their subscribers, said the report. According to In-Stat/MDR, it is tipped to make up one of the most important markets in the next wave of mobile multimedia growth. In January 2003, there were only 10 million mobile subscribers in India. Many choose mobiles in rural areas in order to bypass poorer telecoms infrastructure. Despite this, the penetration rate is still much lower that other countries. Less than 20% of India's total population own a mobile in India, compared to well over 50% in most European countries. The trend echoes the uptake of mobiles in many developing economies, which continues to grow as people opt to leapfrog slower and more expensive state-run fixed-line operators.

Mobile gig aims to rock 3G Mobile gig aims to rock 3G Forget about going to a crowded bar to enjoy a gig by the latest darlings of the music press. Now you could also be at a live gig on your mobile, via the latest third generation (3G) video phones. Rock outfit Rooster are playing what has been billed as the first ever concert broadcast by phone on Tuesday evening from a London venue. The 45-minute gig is due to be "phone cast" by the 3G mobile phone operator, 3. 3G technology lets people take, watch and send video clips on their phones, as well as swap data much faster than with 2G networks like GSM. People with 3G phones in the UK can already download football and music clips on their handsets. Some 1,000 fans of the London-based band will have to pay five pounds for a ticket and need a 3G handset. "Once you have paid, you can come and go as much as you like, because we expect the customers to be mobile," said 3 spokesperson Belinda Henderson. "It's like going to a concert hall, except that you are virtually there." The company behind the trial hopes to learn more about how people use their video phones. "We are looking on how long people will stay on average on the streams. Some people may stay the whole time, some may dip in and out," said Ms Henderson. "We actually expect people to dip in and out because they are mobile and they will be doing other things." 3 is looking to music as a way of persuading more people to take up the latest video phones. It is already planning regular gigs throughout 2005. And during the intermission, of course, you would still be able to make a phone call. Return to results
Mobile networks seek turbo boost Mobile networks seek turbo boost Third-generation mobile (3G) networks need to get faster if they are to deliver fast internet surfing on the move and exciting new services. That was one of the messages from the mobile industry at the 3GSM World Congress in Cannes last week. Fast 3G networks are here but the focus has shifted to their evolution into a higher bandwidth service, says the Global Mobile Suppliers Association. At 3GSM, Siemens showed off a system that transmits faster mobile data. The German company said data could be transmitted at one gigabit a second - up to 20 times faster than current 3G networks. The system is not available commercially yet, but Motorola, the US mobile handset and infrastructure maker, held a clinic for mobile operators on HSDPA (High Speed Downlink Packet Access), a high-speed, high bandwidth technology available now. Early HSDPA systems typically offer around two megabits per second (Mbps) compared with less than 384 kilobits per second (Kbps) on standard 3G networks. "High-Speed Downlink Packet Access (HSDPA) - sometimes called Super 3G - will be vital for profitable services like mobile internet browsing and mobile video clips," according to a report published by UK-based research consultancy Analysys. A number of companies are developing the technology. Nokia and Canada-based wireless communication products company Sierra Wireless recently agreed to work together on High Speed Downlink Packet Access. The two companies aim to jointly market the HSDPA solution to global network operator customers. "While HSDPA theoretically enables data rates up to a maximum of 14Mbps, practical throughputs will be lower than this in wide-area networks," said Dr Alastair Brydon, author of the Analysys report: Pushing Beyond the Limits of 3G with HSDPA and Other Enhancements. "The typical average user rate in a real implementation is likely to be in the region of one megabit per second which, even at this lower rate, will more than double the capacity... when compared to basic WCDMA [3G]," he added. Motorola has conducted five trials of its technology and says speeds of 2.9Mbps have been recorded at the edge of an outdoor 3G cell using a single HSDPA device. But some mobile operators are opting for a technology called Evolution, Data Optimised (EV-DO). US operator Sprint ordered a broadband data upgrade to its 3G network at the end of last year. We are "expanding our network and deploying EV-DO technology to meet customer demand for faster wireless speeds," said Oliver Valente, Sprint's vice president for technology development, when the contract was announced. As part of $3bn in multi-year contracts announced late last year, Sprint will spend around $1bn on EV-DO technology from Lucent Technologies, Nortel Networks and Motorola that provides average data speeds of 0.3-0.5 megabits a second, and peak download rates of 2.4Mbps. MMO2, the UK-based operator with services in the UK, Ireland and Germany, has opted for technology based on the High Speed Downlink Packet Access (HSDPA) standard. Using technology from Lucent, it will offer data speeds of 3.6Mbps from next summer on its Isle of Man 3G network, and will eventually support speeds of up to 14.4Mbps. US operator Cingular Wireless is also adopting HSDPA, using technology from Lucent alongside equipment from Siemens and Ericsson. Siemens' plans for a one gigabit network may be more than a user needs today, but Christoph Caselitz, president of the mobile networks division at the firm says that: "By the time the next generation of mobile communication debuts in 2015, the need for transmission capacities for voice, data, image and multimedia is conservatively anticipated to rise by a factor of 10." Siemens - in collaboration with the Fraunhofer German-Sino Lab for Mobile Communications and the Institute for Applied Radio System Technology - has souped up mobile communications by using three transmitting and four receiving antennae, instead of the usual one. This enables a data transmission, such as sending a big file or video, to be broken up into different flows of data that can be sent simultaneously over one radio frequency band. The speeds offered by3G mobile seemed fast at the time mobile operators were paying huge sums for 3G licences. But today, instead of connecting to the internet by slow, dial-up phone connection, many people are used to broadband networks that offer speeds of 0.5 megabits a second - must faster than 3G. This means users are likely to find 3G disappointing unless the networks are souped up. If they aren't, those lucrative "power users", such as computer geeks and busy business people will avoid them for all but the most urgent tasks, reducing the potential revenues available to mobile operators. But one gigabit a second systems will not be available immediately. Siemens says that though the system works in the laboratory, it still has to assess the mobility of multiple-antennae devices and conduct field trials. A commercial system could be as far away as 2012, though Siemens did not rule out an earlier date. Return to results
Mobiles 'not media players yet' Mobiles 'not media players yet' Mobiles are not yet ready to be all-singing, all-dancing multimedia devices which will replace portable media players, say two reports. Despite moves to bring music download services to mobiles, people do not want to trade multimedia services with size and battery life, said Jupiter. A separate study by Gartner has also said real-time TV broadcasts to mobiles is "unlikely" in Europe until 2007. Technical issues and standards must be resolved first, said the report. Batteries already have to cope with other services that operators offer, like video playback, video messaging, megapixel cameras and games amongst others. Bringing music download services based on the success of computer-based download services will put more demands on battery life. Fifty percent of Europeans said the size of a mobile was the most important factor when it came to choosing their phone, but more power demands tend to mean larger handsets. "Mobile phone music services must not be positioned to compete with the PC music experience as the handsets are not yet ready," said Thomas Husson, mobile analyst at Jupiter research. "Mobile music services should be new and different, and enable operators to differentiate their brands and support third generation network launches." Other problems facing mobile music include limited storage on phones, compared to portable players which can hold up to 40GB of music. The mobile industry is keen to get into music downloading, after the success of Apple's iTunes, Napster and other net music download services. With phones getting smarter and more powerful, there are also demands to be able to watch TV on the move. In the US, services like TiVo To Go let people transfer pre-recorded TV content onto their phones. But, the Gartner report on mobile TV broadcasting in Europe suggests direct broadcasting will have to wait. Currently, TV-like services, where clips are downloaded, are offered by several European operators, like Italy's TIM and 3. Mobile TV will have to overcome several barriers before it is widely taken up though, said the report. Various standards and ways of getting TV signals to mobiles are being worked on globally. In Europe, trials in Berlin and Helsinki are making use of terrestrial TV masts to broadcast compressed signals to handsets with extra receivers. A service from the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation lets people watch TV programmes on their mobiles 24 hours a day. The service uses 3GP technology, one of the standards for mobile TV. But at the end of 2004, the European Telecommunications Institute (Etsi) formally adopted Digital Video Broadcasting Handheld (DVB-H) as the mobile TV broadcasting standard for Europe. Operators will be working on the standard as a way to bring real-time broadcasts to mobiles, as well as trying to overcome several other barriers. The cost and infrastructure needs to set up the services will need to be addressed. Handsets also need to be able to work with the DVB-H standard. TV services will have to live up to the expectations of the digital TV generation too, which expects good quality images at low prices, according to analysts. People are also likely to be put off watching TV on such small screens, said Gartner. Digital video recorders, like Europe's Sky+ box, and video-on-demand services mean people have much more control over what TV they watch. As a result, people may see broadcasting straight to mobiles as taking away that control. More powerful smartphones like the XDA II, Nokia 6600, SonyEricsson P900 and the Orange E200, offering web access, text and multimedia messaging, e-mail, calendar and gaming are becoming increasingly common. A report by analysts InStat/MDR has predicted that smartphone shipments will grow by 44% over the next five years. It says that smartphones will make up 117 million out of 833 million handsets shipped globally by 2009. Return to results
Mobiles rack up 20 years of use Mobiles rack up 20 years of use Mobile phones in the UK are celebrating their 20th anniversary this weekend. Britain's first mobile phone call was made across the Vodafone network on 1 January 1985 by veteran comedian Ernie Wise. In the 20 years since that day, mobile phones have become an integral part of modern life and now almost 90% of Britons own a handset. Mobiles have become so popular that many people use their handset as their only phone and rarely use a landline. The first ever call over a portable phone was made in 1973 in New York but it took 10 years for the first commercial mobile service to be launched. The UK was not far behind the rest of the world in setting up networks in 1985 that let people make calls while they walked. The first call was made from St Katherine's dock to Vodafone's head office in Newbury which at the time was over a curry house. For the first nine days of 1985 Vodafone was the only firm with a mobile network in the UK. Then on 10 January Cellnet (now O2) launched its service. Mike Caudwell, spokesman for Vodafone, said that when phones were launched they were the size of a briefcase, cost about Â£2,000 and had a battery life of little more than 20 minutes. "Despite that they were hugely popular in the mid-80s," he said. "They became a yuppy must-have and a status symbol among young wealthy business folk." This was also despite the fact that the phones used analogue radio signals to communicate which made them very easy to eavesdrop on. He said it took Vodafone almost nine years to rack up its first million customers but only 18 months to get the second million. "It's very easy to forget that in 1983 when we put the bid document in we were forecasting that the total market would be two million people," he said. "Cellnet was forecasting half that." Now Vodafone has 14m customers in the UK alone. Cellnet and Vodafone were the only mobile phone operators in the UK until 1993 when One2One (now T-Mobile) was launched. Orange had its UK launch in 1994. Both newcomers operated digital mobile networks and now all operators use this technology. The analogue spectrum for the old phones has been retired. Called Global System for Mobiles (GSM) this is now the most widely used phone technology on the planet and is used to help more than 1.2 billion people make calls. Mr Caudwell said the advent of digital technology also helped to introduce all those things, such as text messaging and roaming that have made mobiles so popular.

Moyes U-turn on Beattie dismissal Moyes U-turn on Beattie dismissal Everton manager David Moyes will discipline striker James Beattie after all for his headbutt on Chelsea defender William Gallas. The Scot initially defended Beattie, whose dismissal put Everton on the back foot in a game they ultimately lost 1-0, saying Gallas overreacted. But he has had a rethink after looking over the video evidence again. He said: "I believe that I should set the record straight by conceding that the dismissal was right and correct." Moyes added: "My comments on Saturday came immediately after the final whistle and at a point when I had only had the opportunity to see one, very quick re-run of the incident." The club website also reported that Beattie, who seemed unrepentant after Saturday's match, insisting Gallas "would have stayed down a lot longer" if he had headbutted him, has now apologised. Moyes continued: "Although the incident was totally out of character - James has never even been suspended before in his career - his actions were unacceptable and had a detrimental effect on his team-mates. "James did issue a formal apology to myself, his team-mates and to the Everton supporters immediately after the game and that was the right thing to have done. He will now be subjected to the normal club discipline. "He is a competitive player but a fair player and I know how upset he is by what has happened. However, I must say that I do still believe the Chelsea player in question did go down too easily." Speaking immediately after the game, Moyes said: "I don't think it was a sending-off, I have been a centre-half in my time and I would have been ashamed to have gone down as easily as that. "Not in a million years would John Terry have gone down in the same way. I have never heard of anybody butting somebody from behind while you are running after them. "What has happened to big, strong centre-halves? I thought it was a push initially and I still don't think it was a sending-off." An angry Beattie initially said: "He (Gallas) would have stayed down a lot longer if I had headbutted him. "I can tell you it wasn't an intentional headbutt. We were chasing a ball into the corner and William Gallas was looking over his shoulder and blocking me off. "He was stopping as we were running and I said to myself 'if you're going to stay in my way I'll go straight over you'. Our heads barely touched and it wasn't an intentional headbutt."

Nama hits year-end debt redemption target Nama hits year-end debt redemption target Agency used â¬30.2 billion of bonds to buy most of its original portfolio of loans The National Asset Management Agency (Nama) signalled today it had redeemed a further â¬500 million in senior debt to hit its year-end redemption target of â¬7.5 billion. The agency used â¬30.2 billion of bonds to buy most of its original portfolio of loans from the Irish banks in 2010 and 2011. As part of an agreement with the troika, Nama had pledged to buy back the first â¬7.5 billion tranche of debt by the end of 2013. A further â¬7.5 billion is due to be redeemed by 2016, with the residual expected to be cleared by 2020. âThree years ago, the board decided that it would aim to reduce Namaâs debt by 25 per cent by the end of 2013,â Nama chairman Frank Daly said. âWe are very pleased that this first crucial milestone has now been met, despite the difficult market conditions that have prevailed in Ireland during the intervening period.â âThe milestone attained is an important one, not only for Nama in terms of its own progress, but also because it reinforces the very positive international perception of Ireland as a country that is resolutely addressing its difficulties and meeting its targets,â he added. Nama also announced yesterday it had redeemed a further â¬200 million in senior bonds issued to the Central Bank to cover âthe floating chargeâ associated with the liquidation of Irish Bank Resolution Corporation (IBRC), formerly Anglo Irish Bank , in February earlier this year. In total, Nama issued â¬12.9 billion in senior bonds to the Central Bank to cover the IBRC liquidation, and the latest redemption, coupled with the redemption of another â¬300 million of the bonds in October, means that the bonds in issue have been reduced to â¬12.4 billion. Separately, it emerged today that the liquidators of IBRC plan to sell securities essentially offering investors the first chance to wager on the success of Nama. The liquidators, KPMG in Dublin, hired Goodbody Stockbrokers to sell the failed lenderâs junior Nama bonds, according to sources. The liquidators are preparing to sell â¬843 million of junior bonds IBRC received as part payment for loans it sold to Nama. The junior securities only pay out if the agency beats its target of redeeming all its senior debt by 2020. Goodbody is offering the bonds at a discount to nominal value, sources said. The bank valued them at 15 cents in the euro in June 2012. Both the liquidators and Goodbody declined to comment on the matter. âWith overall Irish residential and commercial property prices having returned to growth and UK property on the up, there is a chance investors eyeing these bonds may make a profit,â said Investec economist Philip OâSullivan, said. âStill, there are quite a lot of risks.â Additional reporting by Online News Return to results
Napster offers rented music to go Napster offers rented music to go Music downloading, for those that have rejected the free peer to peer services, can be a costly business. The cost of paying even as little as 70p per track can add up, particularly for those people who own one of the new generation of players that can store thousands of songs. Paying per track for music is becoming as outmoded as paying per minute for internet access and alternative monthly or yearly subscription models are springing up as a more convenient, and ultimately cheaper way of owning music. "Music fans are moving away from buying the traditional bundled package of a dozen or more songs that we used to call an album to newer ways that fit their lifestyle; either single tracks or subscriptions services," said Paul Myers, chief executive of Wippit, a UK-based music download service. While iTunes is doing good business with its sales of individual tracks to iPod owners, others are questioning whether the concept of owning music is even valid in the digital age. Napster is due to launch a new rental subscription service - dubbed Napster to Go in the UK in the next few months. The service can be used on players that support Microsoft Windows latest Digital Rights Management technology known as Janus. This includes players made by Samsung, Rio and Creative. Currently on offer in beta-version in the US, the service costs $15 per month for unlimited downloads. The technology ensures that music downloaded to the player only remains playable while the user subscribes to the service. Users need to update their license on a monthly basis or the tunes will no longer play. This has outraged some digital music lovers, especially as Napster already offers a cheaper service for downloading music to the PC. Napster claims the higher price is a result of record labels charging more for the to-go service and says it also offers "greater value" for customers. Mr Myers is not convinced a rental model will work for consumers. "We've been offering our unlimited music subscription service for more than three years now and our customers know what they want. Format interoperability, excellent value and the reassurance that music purchased from Wippit is theirs to keep and enjoy on whatever device they choose," he said. "Who wants to download a track that won't play next month if you decide to unsubscribe to the service or change portable player for an iPod or the latest mobile phone?" Wippit offers a download subscription service for Â£4.99 per month or Â£50 per year. It has a catalogue of around 60,000 songs. Return to results
Net fingerprints combat attacks Net fingerprints combat attacks Eighty large net service firms have switched on software to spot and stop net attacks automatically. The system creates digital fingerprints of ongoing incidents that are sent to every network affected. Firms involved in the smart sensing system believe it will help trace attacks back to their source. Data gathered will be passed to police to help build up intelligence about who is behind worm outbreaks and denial of service attacks. Firms signing up for the sensing system include MCI, BT, Deutsche Telekom, Energis, NTT, Bell Canada and many others. The creation of the fingerprinting system has been brokered by US firm Arbor Networks and signatures of attacks will be passed to anyone suffering under the weight of an attack. Increasingly computer criminals are using swarms of remotely controlled computers to carry out denial of service attacks on websites, launch worms and relay spam around the net. "We have seen attacks involving five and ten gigabytes of traffic," said Rob Pollard, sales director for Arbor Networks which is behind the fingerprinting system. "Attacks of that size cause collateral damage as they cross the internet before they get to their destination," he said. Once an attack is spotted and its signature defined the information will be passed back down the chain of networks affected to help every unwitting player tackle the problem. Mr Pollard said Arbor was not charging for the service and it would pass on fingerprint data to every network affected. "What we want to do is help net service firms communicate with each other and then push the attacks further and further back around the world to their source," said Mr Pollard. Arbor Network's technology works by building up a detailed history of traffic on a network. It spots which computers or groups of users regularly talk to each other and what types of traffic passes between machines or workgroups. Any anomaly to this usual pattern is spotted and flagged to network administrators who can take action if the traffic is due to a net-based attack of some kind. This type of close analysis has become very useful as net attacks are increasingly launched using several hundred or thousand different machines. Anyone looking at the traffic on a machine by machine basis would be unlikely to spot that they were all part of a concerted attack. "Attacks are getting more diffuse and more sophisticated," said Malcolm Seagrave, security expert at Energis. "In the last 12 months it started getting noticeable that criminals were taking to it and we've seen massive growth." He said that although informal systems exist to pass on information about attacks, often commercial confidentiality got in the way of sharing enough information to properly combat attacks.

Newcastle move in for Boa Morte Newcastle move in for Boa Morte Newcastle manager Graeme Souness has confirmed Fulham striker Luis Boa Morte is his latest transfer target. Souness wants to add the Â£3m-rated Portugal international to his revamped squad during the transfer window. He said: "We have declared an interest in him. The chairman is working hard to bring at least one more body in before this window goes past." Souness may offer Olivier Bernard, Titus Bramble or Lee Bowyer as bait in a deal for the 27-year-old. The Newcastle boss also unveiled Jean-Alain Boumsong, his Â£8m buy from Ranger, and defender Celestine Babayaro, a Â£1m capture from Chelsea, as he revamps his squad. Fulham have insisted Boa Morte is not for sale and hope he will agree a new contract - but Souness is determined to land his man.
Nintendo adds media playing to DS Nintendo adds media playing to DS Nintendo is releasing an adapter for its DS handheld console so it can play music and video. The add-on for the DS means people can download TV programmes, film clips or MP3 files to the adaptor and then play them back while on the move. The release of the media add-on is an attempt by the Japanese games giant to protect its dominance of the handheld gaming market. Nintendo said the media adapter will be available from February in Japan. The Nintendo DS is the successor to the hugely successful GameBoy handheld game console and went on sale in Japan on 2 December. The DS has two screens, one of which is touch sensitive, and also has on-board a short-range wireless link that lets people play against each other. The launch of the media adapter, and the attempt to broaden the appeal of the device, is widely seen as a response to the unveiling of the Sony PSP which was built as a multi-purpose media player and game gadget from the start. Sony is thought to be preparing pre-packaged movies and music for the PSP. The add-on will also work with the GameBoy Advance SP. Nintendo dominates the handheld gaming console world thanks to successive versions of the GameBoy. More than 28 million GameBoy Advance handhelds have been sold around the world. The dual-screen DS is also thought to be selling well with more than 2.5 million expected to be sold by the end of 2004. Nintendo said it had no plans to sell the media adapter outside Japan. When it goes on sale the adapter is expected to cost about 5000 yen (Â£25), roughly the difference in price between the DS and the higher-priced Sony PSP. Comments are closed for this article.
Obama to choose Janet Yellen for top Fed job Obama to choose Janet Yellen for top Fed job Nomination of first woman to run worldâs most influential bank relieves markets President Barack Obama will nominate Janet Yellen as chairwoman of the Federal Reserve later today, administration officials said last night, ending an unusually public search to fill one of the most important economic policy-making jobs in the world. Photograph: Mary F Calvert/The New York Times US president Barack Obama will nominate Fed number two Janet Yellen today to run the worldâs most influential central bank, providing some relief to markets that would expect her to tread carefully in winding down economic stimulus. The nomination will put Ms Yellen on course to be the first woman to lead the institution in its 100-year history. The advocate for aggressive action to stimulate US economic growth through low interest rates and large-scale bond purchases would replace Ben Bernanke , whose second term as Fed chairman expires on January 31st. If confirmed by the US Senate, which is expected to endorse her, she would provide continuity with the policies the Fed has established under Mr Bernanke. Analysts say she would move cautiously in reining in policies in place to shore up the worldâs largest economy. Expectations that the Fed might start to taper its stimulus program have roiled financial markets since May and the central bank shocked investors in September by maintaining its cash injections of $85 billion (â¬63 billion) a month in full. Her nomination would come during a political stalemate in Washington that has closed the US government and threatened a US default if lawmakers fail to raise the $16.7 trillion debt ceiling by an October 17th deadline. US stock index futures rose and the dollar slipped on the news of Ms Yellenâs pending nomination. The debt standoff is fueling expectations the Fed may delay any plans to reduce its stimulus for now. If confirmed, she would join the Fedâs honor roll along with such household names as Paul Volcker and Alan Greenspan , predecessors as head of an institution that can influence the course of the world economy. âI believe sheâll be confirmed by a wide margin,â said senator Charles Schumer , a Democrat from New York. Described as a âgood eggâ by fellow Fed policymaker Richard Fisher and a âvery able personâ by Japanâs chief cabinet secretary Yoshihide Suga , her most immediate challenge may be to determine when the Fed should scale back its bond buying. After Septemberâs surprise decision against tapering, many economists now think the Fed will not move until Mr Bernanke has left office. Mr Obama turned to Ms Yellen (67) after his former economic adviser Lawrence Summers withdrew from consideration in the face of fierce opposition from within the presidentâs own Democratic Party , raising questions about his chances of congressional confirmation. The contest between Mr Summers and Ms Yellen played out all summer in a public way not usually associated with the selection of the top US central banker. Respected economist Ms Yellen has enjoyed strong support from Democrats. In an unusual move, 20 Senate Democrats signed a letter earlier this year pressing Mr Obama to turn to the former professor from the University of California at Berkeley. Her Republican backing is much softer. Many Republicans worry Fed policy of holding overnight interest rates at zero and buying bonds aggressively to drive other borrowing costs lower could lead to asset bubbles and an unwanted pickup in inflation. âI voted against Vice Chairman Yellenâs original nomination to the Fed in 2010 because of her dovish views on monetary policy,â senator Bob Corker of Tennessee said in a statement. âWe will closely examine her record since that time, but I am not aware of anything that demonstrates her views have changed.â Senator Richard Shelby of Alabama, another Republican, said he has concerns about her âproclivity to print moneyâ and her record as a bank regulator. Still, MS Yellen is expected to garner enough support to secure the 60 votes needed to overcome any procedural hurdles in the 100-seat Senate. Democrats control the chamber 54-46. .

One million face higher health insurance, industry claims One million face higher health insurance, industry claims Health insurers call for review of tax relief cap introduced in Budget On the day of the budget, Minister for Finance Michael Noonan capped the amount of premium on which tax relief is available to â¬1,000 per adult and â¬500 per child. Photograph: Aidan Crawley Carl O'Brien, Arthur Beesley Health insurers have urged the Government to review the changes in tax relief on private health policies announced in this weekâs budget, which will raise costs for hundreds of thousands of people. The insurance companies claimed the Government had made a âfundamental miscalculationâ about the number of people affected. While Minister for Finance Michael Noonan said changes would only hit people on âgold-platedâ policies, the insurance industry last night estimated that as many as one million customers will face average increases of as much as 8 per cent, or â¬100 each. However, the Government was last night standing firm, insisting that there would be no change in policy. The move has caused confusion since it came into effect this week, with the four main insurers â VHI, Aviva, Laya and GloHealth â scrambling to change the prices of their policies overnight. Downgrading policies Some industry commentators claim the move will lead to an acceleration in numbers leaving health insurance or downgrading policies, placing increased strain on both public and private hospitals. Mr Noonan said the Revenue Commissioners had estimated in the run-up to the budget that 577,000 people would be affected â a figure endorsed by the Health Insurance Authority , the market regulator. Many of the policyholders, Mr Noonan added, would lose tax relief on only a small amount of their premiums. On budget day, Mr Noonan capped the amount of premium on which tax relief is available to â¬1,000 per adult and â¬500 per child. He said at the time this would ânot affect the majority of individuals who avail of more standard levels of medical coverâ. A spokesman for Mr Noonan last night said the policy will not be changed, but officials were willing to meet representatives of the insurance industry to discuss technical aspects of how the rate change would be implemented. In a statement, the Department of Finance said many policyholders will be only marginally affected and customers could âshop aroundâ for cheaper cover, using the Health Insurance Authorityâs website. But the authority yesterday said its website was still being updated and new premium costs would not be available for at least 24 hours. The departmentâs statement said the âvast majorityâ of families with standard premiums would not be affected by the changes and would continue to receive tax relief towards the cost of their private health insurance. It pointed out that, for example, a family of two adults and two children with a gross premium for their health insurance policy of â¬3,000 will continue to receive the tax relief at source of 20 per cent, which is worth â¬600. âProgressiveâ It said the measure was progressive in that those who pay the most for health insurance will bear the brunt of the impact. Health insurance tax relief last year cost the exchequer some â¬500 million. âIntroducing an upper ceiling on this relief is intended to ensure continuing support, via the tax system, for those who purchase standard but good policies, while reducing exchequer exposure to the more expensive policies,â the statement said. .

Opinion: 2015 could see a return to modestly expansionist budgets Opinion: 2015 could see a return to modestly expansionist budgets John McHale Under reasonable central growth projections, budgetary projections extended out to the end of the decade indicate that the most difficult phase should be complete by 2015. These projections assume full compliance with all fiscal rules. After 2015, the projections indicate that it should be feasible to have modest expansions in money terms instead of the contractionary budgets that we have become accustomed.While the scope for expenditure increases is still likely to be limited, it should be at least possible for public expenditure increases to keep track with inflation. Of course, huge uncertainty surrounds any such longer-term term projections. Growth could disappoint; new banking losses could emerge and fall on the State; the euro zone crisis could flare up again. But the path out of the crisis is slowly becoming visible. Budget 2014 The Government has announced its intention to pursue a smaller nominal adjustment of â¬2.5 billion in Budget 2014 than the â¬3.1 billion originally planned. The main reason is that the promissory note deal allows the budget deficit targets as a share of GDP to be achieved with fewer measures. The Fiscal Council has argued that the preferred policy was to stick with the original plan. There are two main reasons. First, given the uncertainties surrounding growth, there remain significant doubts relating to the ability to meet the key 3 per cent deficit target for 2015 required for exit from the European Excessive Deficit Procedure (EDP). The existing buffer is eroded by the choice to do less than planned. It is true that growth disappointments could be accommodated by doing more than the â¬2 billion planned for Budget 2015. But such a reversal to a tougher budgetary policy would be a blow to confidence. Second, there have been gains in credibility hard-won through our success in delivering on what was promised. While I donât want to exaggerate the loss from a relatively modest scaling back of what was planned, it is inevitable that there has been some sacrifice in credibility at a time when Ireland is seeking to restore full bond market access and negotiate a back-up official credit line. On the other hand, the â¬600 million reduction should boost growth in 2014 by about 0.2 per cent and lower the unemployment rate by about 0.1 per cent. It is also undeniable that people need whatever break they can get after six years of painful austerity measures. But neither can we forget that any extra borrowing next year will have to be repaid with interest. Even so, future growth could help with the later heavy lifting, and it should be easier to forego future tax reductions and expenditure increases than to bear hikes and cuts now. The choice of the adjustment figure for Budget 2014 has therefore been a difficult balancing act. The more important point is that the broader crisis-resolution strategy remains in place and is working.

PMI shows economy is still expanding, but growth eases slightly PMI shows economy is still expanding, but growth eases slightly Stronger growth in Germanyâs manufacturing sector was encouraging, Markit said. Germanyâs private sector grew at the slowest pace in three months in October, a survey showed today, in a sign that Europeâs largest economy is expanding, but only moderately. Markitâs preliminary composite Purchasing Managersâ Index (PMI), which tracks growth in both the manufacturing and services sector and covers more than two-thirds of the economy, slipped to 52.6 in October from 53.2 the previous month. The reading was above the 50 mark that separates growth from contraction for a sixth straight month, but marked the lowest level since July as the services sector performed less well than expected. âGermanyâs private sector started the final quarter of 2013 in a positive fashion,â said Tim Moore, an economist at Markit. âA slower rate of expansion in services activity meant that overall growth eased slightly from the trend recorded over the third quarter.â After suffering a subdued start to 2013, the German economy expanded 0.7 per cent in the April to June quarter thanks mainly to domestic demand. Economists expect it to have grown at a slower pace in the third quarter. âWe are looking at 0.4 per cent in the third quarter, possibly 0.3 in the fourth,â said Markit chief economist Chris Williamson. The index tracking the services sector dropped to 52.3 from 53.7 in September, missing the consensus forecast in a Online News poll of 25 economists for a rise to 53.9 as firms cut jobs and growth in new business slowed. Mr Williamson said this disappointing figure suggested that the domestic economy was not performing that strongly due to cautiousness among consumers, although it is still expected to drive overall growth this year, helped by a strong labour market, solid wage hikes and favourable financing conditions. But stronger growth in the manufacturing sector was encouraging, said Mr Williamson. The index tracking the manufacturing sector was in expansion territory for the fourth consecutive month, rising in line with expectations to 51.5 from 51.1 in September. New orders in the manufacturing sector continued to grow although contracts from abroad expanded at a more subdued pace. Earlier this month, Germanyâs trade association slashed its forecast for full-year export growth to less than 1 percent from a previous estimate of 3 per cent. (Online News) .

Parry firm over Gerrard Parry firm over Gerrard Listen to the full interview on Sport on Five and the Online News Sport website from 1900 GMT. But Parry, speaking exclusively to Online News Sport, also admits Gerrard, who has been constantly linked with Chelsea, will have the final say on his future. He told Online News Five Live: "Steven is above money. He is the future of Liverpool. "It doesn't matter if it's Â£30m, Â£40m or Â£50m, we will not accept offers. But we are also realistic enough to know we can't keep Steven against his will." On the subject of Liverpool's finances, Parry also revealed the club is ready to explore the possibility of a sponsorship deal for its proposed new stadium. And responding to criticism from Online News Sport pundit and former Liverpool stalwart Alan Hansen, he insisted talks on new investment are ongoing, but added the door has not closed on shareholder and lifelong fan Steve Morgan. Parry joined Liverpool as chief executive in July 1998 from a similar role at the Premier League. There have been several highs and lows during his time in charge at Anfield - and he had a busy summer, overseeing the arrival of new manager Rafael Benitez and managing to hold on to Steven Gerrard. On the subject of Liverpool's captain and prize asset, Parry revealed Real Madrid did ask for an option on the England midfield man during negotiations for striker Fernando Morientes. He said: "They were looking for ways of saying they got more out of the deal for Fernando Morientes, but the response to Real Madrid was the same - Steven is not for sale." But when asked if Gerrard would be a Liverpool player on the first day of next season, Parry said: "I sincerely hope he will be. Steven knows my views. He knows Rafa's views. "We have re-affirmed recently to Steven that we are trying to build a team around him. We crave success as much as he does. We know he's ambitious and nobody can argue with that. "I think Steven would dearly love to win things with Liverpool more than he'd like to do anything else. "We all want to see progress by next season. He's not alone in that. There are a lot of other players who feel the same, so we all have a common aim." It is expected Chelsea will test Liverpool with a Â£30m-plus bid in the summer - but Parry claims he will be in no mood to listen. "There have been a lot of open secrets about Steven, most of which have been complete myths. It is suggested we had a deal tied up last summer. We didn't had an offer last summer," Parry explained. "We had told Chelsea that as far as we were concerned he was not for sale and we didn't want to sell him. In reality it didn't go beyond that. "Maybe there will be an offer in the summer. Maybe there won't. "Our position is we want Steven to stay, but we are also realistic enough and have enough respect for Steven - and he has enough respect for us - to know that it is his decision that will be crucial. "You are not going to keep a player like Steven against his will. That just doesn't work, but any idea we are going to accept offers for Steven and then tell him 'by the way we've decided to sell you' is not on the agenda. You can forget that." Parry is currently in the process of finalising funding for Liverpool's new stadium in Stanley Park, which is set to open in 2007. And he confessed Arsenal's Â£100m deal with Emirates to sponsor their new ground - complete with naming rights - has given the Anfield club serious food for thought. He said: "I have to say historically it is something I have been against, and I have been on record as saying that, but I think the size of the Arsenal deal is a real eye-opener. "I would say in the past deals have been done frankly far too cheaply and it just hasn't even been worth contemplating. "But the Arsenal deal is the sort of deal that causes you to draw breath and say 'wow - that's interesting.' "My personal point of view is that I would find it a hell of a lot more palatable than a shared stadium." Some Liverpool fans would find such a move highly controversial, but Parry countered: "I recognise it would be an emotive issue for many supporters, but you look at the amount of money available and it could go into the team. "If it was the right partner how strong an issue is it? Time will tell. "I think the stadium will always be Anfield, not least because of where it is, but do we need to investigate the possibilities of sponsorship? I think it would be remiss not to. "That's not to say we have made a decision that we will go down that road, but I think it is clearly something we have to explore." On the subject of possible new investment, Parry revealed Liverpool are still in negotiations with a mystery investor, with rumours of interest from the Middle East. That prompted the withdrawal of tycoon Steve Morgan, who got frustrated by failed bids and what he claimed was indecision by the board. He also accused Liverpool of using him as "a stalking horse" to attract other bids, but Parry explained: "Steve has never been used as a stalking horse. There's no need, and that is not the way we do business. "We had discussions with Steve over the course of 2004. I think we came close to concluding a deal in the summer but it didn't happen. "Quite genuinely, the new interest did appear relatively late in the day just prior to the AGM in December, and as I have said it was of such potential magnitude, and that potential is so exciting, we felt we had to evaluate it. We are still evaluating it. "Steve's interest was taken very much on its own merits. His enthusiasm for the club is there for all to see and who knows what the next few months will hold? "The door isn't closed on anything. We had a perfectly sensible dialogue with Steve last year. "We have a common interest in making Liverpool successful. That's a dream we all share, so as far as I'm concerned the door is not closed." I would take Â£50m if we had no investment, but if we did, keep him. As for the stadium, if it gets us cash what difference does it make really? Â£50m for Gerrard? I don't care who you are, the Directors would take the money and it is the way it should be. We cannot let that sum of money go, despite Gerrard's quality. Through a cleverly worded statement, the club has effectively forced Gerrard to publicly make the decision for himself, which I think is the right thing to do. Critical time for Liverpool with regards to Gerrard. Ideally we would want to secure his future to the club for the long term. I am hoping he doesn't walk out of the club like Michael Owen did for very little cash. Â£50m realistically would allow Rafa to completely rebuild the squad, however, if we can afford to do this AND keep Gerrard we will be better for it. I would however be happy with Gerrard's transfer for any fee over Â£35m. Parry's statements are clever in that any future Gerrard transfer cannot be construed as a lack of ambition by the club to not try and keep their best players. Upping the ante is another smart move by Parry. I would keep Gerrard. No amount of money could replace his obvious love of the club and determination to succeed. The key is if Gerrard comes out and says that he is happy. Clearly, if he isn't, then we would be foolish not to sell. The worrying thing is who would you buy (or who would come) pending possible non-Champions League football. Return to results
Patients and doctors would benefit from duty of candour obligation, conference hears Patients and doctors would benefit from duty of candour obligation, conference hears Mr Justice Liam McKechnie: said justice sysetme must provide all necessary support to anyone harmed as a result of a medical mishap. File Photograph: Bryan OâBrien/The Online News Patients, doctors and health managers would all benefit from the introduction of a system requiring healthcare professionals to disclose medical accidents promptly, a conference has heard. There is a compelling case for creating a legal âduty of candourâ for victims of medical negligence, according to speakers at the conference organised by two patient advocacy groups. The current adversarial approach to medical accidents and complaints prolongs pain for families, as they are forced to battle with the system for compensation on behalf of their loved one, delegates were told. A more open system would see all healthcare professionals obliged to reveal when a medical accident takes place at the earliest possible opportunity, according to Peter Walsh , chief executive of Action against Medical Accidents. âSomeone who goes into a hospital and through no fault of their own has their health compromised and their quality of life diminished. The current system of âdefend and denyâ is undermining these individuals,â Mr Walsh said. Dr Timothy McDonald, chief safety and risk officer for health affairs at the University of Illinois, said a duty of candour might seem counter-intuitive from a financial viewpoint, given that it notifies patients early on about medical mistakes. However, since a similar system was introduced in Illinois, malpractice premium expenses had dropped by $22 million over three years and claims have fallen by up to 50 per cent. âPatients are less likely to sue when a hospital is forthcoming and transparent,â he said. Up to 60-70 per cent of law suits go away without payment once doctors and hospitals share all information. UCD economist Moore McDowell said the true financial cost of medical accidents is a significant multiple of the headline figure in the HSE accounts. The economically rational and avoidable level of accident-related costs in the HSE sector is about â¬250-400 million a year. Supreme Court judge Mr Justice Liam McKechnie said the justice system must ensure that where harm has been caused proper access to an effective remedy must be available and, where required, all necessary support must be provided.

Petit career ended by knee injury Petit career ended by knee injury Former France midfielder Emmanuel Petit has ended his playing career after failing to recover from knee surgery. The 34-year-old ex-Arsenal and Chelsea star made the decision before Christmas after realising he would never regain full fitness. He told French newspaper L'Equipe: "I knew straight away it was over. Twenty years of your life come to a stop. It's like a small death." Petit had not played since being released by Chelsea last summer. A key member of the France side that won the 1998 World Cup, Petit scored the last goal in their 3-0 victory over Brazil in the final. He won the French League title with Monaco in 1997, and the Premiership and FA Cup double with Arsenal in 1998. Arsene Wenger invited him back to train with the Gunners earlier this season, and at one stage considered giving him a contract. "Globally I'm very proud of my career," Petit added. "My only regret is having to put an end to my career because of an injury like Marco van Basten or Glenn Hoddle." Wenger said on Friday: "I think it is a wise decision because he is in a situation where he couldn't come back to a level where he was. "I know Manu well enough - because I gave him his start when he was 18-years old - to know that he's too proud to walk on the pitch and be the shadow of the player he was. "Somebody asked me today whether I would be looking to bring in a player of his stature and I replied that you don't find players of his quality available in January." Wenger, who brought Petit to England from his former club Monaco in 1997, added: "He was fantastic. I feel his home is at Arsenal Football Club. "We were lucky at Arsenal to have Petit at the peak of the career. He was a tremendous player." Comments are closed for this article.
Premier League probes Cole claims Premier League probes Cole claims The Premier League is to investigate allegations that Chelsea made an illegal approach for Ashley Cole. Arsenal and England defender Cole reportedly met Blues boss Jose Mourinho and chief executive Peter Kenyon in a London hotel 10 days ago. Chelsea have yet to officially confirm or deny the meeting, which would be in breach of Premier League rule K3. Now the Gunners have asked for an inquiry to look into claims that their player has been "tapped up". The Premier League says it will look into "further information" concerning the allegations, which it received from the News of the World on Saturday. Both clubs have pledged to co-operate with the inquiry. A statement from Chelsea read: "Chelsea can confirm it has been in discussions with the Premier League over the last few days and we will be co-operating fully with the inquiry announced today. "It would be inappropiate to make any further comment until the inquiry is completed." The Premier League's statement confirmed Arsenal had asked for the matter to be investigated. It read: "The board is finally able to establish a clear position from Arsenal and is grateful for chairman Peter Hill-Wood's confirmation that his club want the Premier League to investigate the matter and that they will co-operate fully with any inquiry. "The board is also pleased that Chelsea have given a similar undertaking." Gunners vice-chairman David Dein has voiced concern at Chelsea's stance on the issue, and told the News of the World: "From the evidence I have seen so far there is a huge credibility gap." If Chelsea are found guilty of an illegal approach, they could be deducted points - although Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger has said he would be opposed to this. Aston Villa were recently given a reprimand by the Premier League after Southampton complained about an approach to James Beattie earlier in the season. Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho, speaking after his side's draw with Manchester City on Sunday, insisted he is not worried about the inquiry or its outcome. "To me, the effect is zero," he said. "I know nothing about it and I don't want to know about it. I'm not worried about it. My life is the same, trying to enjoy my work and my life." Meanwhile, Everton boss David Moyes told Online News Radio Five Live that stopping clubs from approaching players via their agents would be difficult. "It's part of football and will be very hard to change. It does happen a lot," he told Online News Radio Five Live's Sportsweek programme. "It should be manager to manager or chairman to chairman but the way modern football has gone I don't think that happens. "There is a way the player gets got to but that is part of football. I don't think it is right but that is the way it works." Comments are closed for this article.
Prinz beats Hamm to Fifa trophy Prinz beats Hamm to Fifa trophy Germany's Birgit Prinz has been named Fifa women's player of the year for the second year running. The striker won the vote with 376 points, well ahead of American Mia Hamm (286) and 18-year-old Brazilian Marta (281). Prinz paid tribute to both Hamm and Marta. "I am delighted to be one of the three nominees," she said. "Mia is nothing less than a role model for women footballers, while Marta represents the future. "If you saw what she did at the U-19 World Championship, you'll know what I'm talking about." Prinz, who starred for Germany as they won the World Cup in 2003, was expected to lead her country to Olympic gold in Athens this year. But despite Prinz finishing the tournament as joint top scorer, Germany had to settle for bronze. They began the tournament with an Olympic record 8-0 win over China, with Prinz netting four times. But in the semi-finals, Germany were upset by a Hamm-inspired USA after extra-time. The USA went on to take gold at the expense of Brazil, with Hamm announcing her retirement immediately after the Games. Prinz's performances for Germany, as well as for club side FFC Frankfurt, led to a well-publicised approach from Perugia president Luciano Gaucci. Gaucci, who had already made headlines for signing the son of Libyan leader Colonel Gaddafi, wanted to make Prinz the first female player to play for a Serie A side. But though she admitted to considering the offer, Prinz turned it down. "The comparisons between me and world class men's players are flattering, but I believe they don't fit reality," she said. And to Gaucci's reported description of her as "very beautiful" with a "great figure", Prinz responded: "I'm not especially suited to be a glamour girl." The issue of women playing alongside men was brought up again on the day of the Fifa awards. A second division club in Mexico announced the signing of Maribel Dominguez - but the move was blocked by Fifa. And on Monday, Prinz commented: "I'm not in favour of mixed sex teams. "We need to acknowledge the differences, especially at the physical level, and come to terms with them. In any case, other sports don't have mixed teams." Comments are closed for this article.
Putting a face to 'Big Brother' Putting a face to 'Big Brother' Literally putting a face on technology could be one of the keys to improving our interaction with hi-tech gadgets. Imagine a surveillance system that also presents a virtual embodiment of a person on a screen who can react to your behaviour, and perhaps even alert you to new e-mails. Basic versions of these so-called avatars already exist. Together with speech and voice recognition systems, they could replace the keyboard and mouse in the near future. Some of these ideas have been showcased at the London's Science Museum, as part of its Future Face exhibition. One such avatar is Jeremiah. It is a virtual man, which you can download for free and install in your computer. His creator, Richard Bowden, lecturer at the Centre for Vision, Speech and Signal Processing at the University of Surrey, refers to Jeremiah as "him", rather than it. "Jeremiah is a virtual face that attempts to emulate humans in the way it responds to activity. He is very childlike, he likes visual stimulus," he told the Online News News website. "When he sees children running and laughing and waving at him, he smiles at them. If you ignore him, he gets angry. If you leave, he gets sad. And you can also even surprise him." Jeremiah is not actually intelligent. It works on vision, reacting in a preset way to the information provided by a surveillance tracker system. It is not able to talk or to hear you, at least not yet. The Surrey team is already working on Jeremiah's next version, that will replace the human face with an underwater and more interactive creature: Finn the fish. "I am interested in the interaction, providing the ability of a system to watch what's going on and make decisions based on that," explained Dr Bowden. The research comes at a time when people are having to cope with an increasing number of hi-tech gadgets. Experts say a much more natural way to interact with these devices, such as a virtual human, could make it much easier to make the most of all those new gizmos. "If you get up at three o'clock in the morning, and you go downstairs, there are probably two things you are going to do: either going to the bathroom, or maybe you are going to make a cup of tea," said Dr Bowden. "Now if the system can watch your behaviour over time, it can learn this, so it would predict what you are going to do, turn on the lights for you, or, before you even get to the kettle, it could have switched it on." You might even be able to tell your home surveillance system that you will be going away on holiday, and ask if it could make sure that the house is secure once you have left. This might sound like a scary vision of an Orwellian future. But it might all depend on the face that is watching you. "When we put the surveillance cameras in our centre, a lot of people were very unhappy about the fact that there was a system watching them," said Dr Bowden. "But when Jeremiah's camera went in, nobody minded, because although it's still watching them, they could see what it was watching." Comments are closed for this article.
Real story of bailout exit is how good crisis was wasted Real story of bailout exit is how good crisis was wasted Precautionary credit line issue looks like a ball of smoke from which the Government is mining a political victory ECB president Mario Draghi: has promised to do whatever it takes to keep the euro together. Photograph: Ralph Orlowski/Online News There is no such thing as a good bailout â it is an oxymoron â but that has not not stopped us claiming whatever kudos were going over the past three years. To paraphrase the Taoiseach, we have become the best small country in the world in which to do bailouts by 2013. This is not nearly as pathetic as it seems. Our ability to meet pretty much all the conditions of the bailout has done much to restore international confidence in Ireland and its institutions. Making a virtue out of this necessity was the obvious and correct strategy. Our partners clearly understood this and played their part. First by allowing the Government play down their quarterly visits, which were the physical manifestation of our surrender of control. The troika was also careful not to rub our noses in this embarrassing mess whilst being quick to praise us when they could. Troikaâs self-interest Their actions were informed by enlightened self-interest. Undermining the already fragile and battered Irish political establishment was not a smart move if they wanted to get their â¬45 billion back. It is this sort of pragmatism presumably which is behind the troikaâs willingness to let the Government make such a song and dance out of whether or not to take a formal contingent credit line from the troika when the programme ends in a few weeks. You only have to look at Irish bond yields to conclude that this is very close to much ado about nothing. The people who have lent us money and whom we will need to borrow more money from seem unmoved by the will-we wonât-we? drama playing out in front of them. This is presumably because they know â as does pretty much anyone who has followed the events of the past few years â that if things do not go well over the next few years for Ireland an additional funding line can be arranged. The source of the funds and framework to deliver them now exists in the form of the European Stability Mechanism. The markets also know Ireland will be subjected to a very high level of external supervision for as long as it remains in the euro as a result of the fiscal compact and all the other Governance reforms brought in post crisis. There will also be additional surveillance associated with our borrowings from the IMF. Finally, there is pledge of the president of the ECB, Mario Draghi , to do whatever it takes to keep the euro together. So why all the fuss over the precautionary funding line? It would seem at best to be a marginally important issue as we exit the bailout. But it has been made a central issue â if not the central issue â and taken on an importance that is hard to justify. The narrative that has been promulgated over the past few weeks is that the troika are trying to force us to take the precautionary funding line and in the process make us submit to at least another year of intrusion into our affairs. However, the story goes, such is the determination of the Government to regain Irelandâs sovereignty they are prepared to stand up to the troika, refuse to take the precautionary funding line and bravely go it alone. Divert attention Itâs a nice story and allows us extract some sort of victory out of the ending of one of the sorriest chapters in the history of the State. The troika seem prepared to play along â or at least not burst our bubble â but occasionally the mask slips and their indifference becomes visible. Asked about it last week, Draghi said the ECB, the European Commission and the IMF âwould say that certainly it would be useful to have a precautionary programme in placeâ. You could spend a lot of time pondering what Draghi means by useful or you could take it at face value; they think we should take one but itâs really our call. The closer you look, the more the whole precautionary credit line issue looks like a ball of smoke from which the Government is cleverly mining a political victory. It also serves to divert attention from the fact that, after the best opportunity in a generation to push though reforms, the health service remains in chaos, social welfare continues to disincentivise work; professional fees remain stupidly high; the banks donât work and hundreds of thousands continue to struggle with debts that they canât pay. The real story of the end of the bailout is not the contingent credit line; the story is how a good crisis appears to have been wasted. .

Redknapp's Saints face Pompey tie Redknapp's Saints face Pompey tie New Southampton manager Harry Redknapp faces an immediate reunion with his old club Portsmouth after they were drawn together in the FA Cup fourth round. Exeter City face a home tie against Middlesbrough if they can see off holders Manchester United in a replay. Oldham's reward for beating Manchester City is a home tie with Bolton, while Yeovil will be away to Charlton. Chelsea host Birmingham, Tottenham travel to West Brom and Arsenal will entertain Championship side Wolves. Saints boss Redknapp was upbeat about the draw despite having to face the club he walked out on just six weeks ago. "I've said before, I can walk away from Portsmouth with my head held high, I'm proud of what I did there and no one can take that away from me," said Redknapp. "Maybe I'll be in for some stick, there's always some of that but we'll get on with it and it's only a game of football." Birmingham manager Steve Bruce admitted their trip to Stamford Bridge to face Premiership leaders Chelsea was the toughest draw possible. Bruce said: "I'm still in shock. We've given good accounts of ourselves against Chelsea in the past and played well when we lost 1-0 at home at the start of the season - but that's the past. "But it's the best competition in the world as far as I am concerned and we will give it our best shot." Brentford boss Martin Allen remained cautious despite his side's favourable draw - a home tie with either Hartlepool or Boston. "The best thing is, it's a home game. However, we know that whoever we play it is going to be a really tough game," said Allen. "But it's not about the opposition, it's about us. We all want to get through to the next round and face a massive team, that's the way it is." Meanwhile, the Online News has confirmed it will be televising Exeter's replay with Man Utd live on Wednesday 19 January, from 1930 on Online News One.

Result means union will support proposal made by university health committee Result means union will support proposal made by university health committee UCD students have voted to support a smoke-free campus. Photograph: Frank Miller/The Online News Cigarette breaks by the Belfield lake are one step closer to ending at University College Dublin where students have voted in favour of a smoke-free campus. The vote result means that the UCD Studentsâ Union (UCDSU) will support a proposal by the universityâs health promotion committee to make the campus smoke free. The result means that UCDâs health committee will now begin consulting with both academic and administrative staff representatives on the proposal, a university spokesman said. However the result does not necessarily mean that the 320-acre south Dublin campus will become smoke-free . UCDSU president MÃ­cheÃ¡l Gallagher said when the proposal was put to the universityâs health promotion committee in March last they felt it âwould be necessary to have a referendum on this issue to gauge the levels of support for the issueâ. Mr Gallagher is a member of the health committee. âThe result today shows studentsâ engagement with the democratic process. They have endorsed the proposal for a smoke free campus. UCD students have a proud tradition of being on the cutting edge of health promotion initiatives,â Mr Gallagher said . Students taking part in the referendum voted 55 per cent in favour of a smoke-free campus. Over 2,500 votes were cast in the poll held by UCD Studentsâ Union out of some 30,000 students. The voting took place on Tuesday and Wednesday of this week on the following proposal: âThis union supports the smoke free campus initiative, as proposed by the UCD Health Promotion Committee.â Anti-smoking lobby group Ash Ireland has been campaiging to encourage third-level institutions to ban smoking on college campuses across the State. Such on-campus tobacco bans have been introduced at many universities in the United States. The Health Service Executive has introduced a smoke-free campus policy at many hospitals and has said all HSE campuses will become tobacco-free by 2015. Last year independent senator John Crown failed in his bid to make Leinster House grounds the first smoke-free parliament in the world.
Revenue targets 60 wealthy individuals over non-payment of domicile levy Revenue targets 60 wealthy individuals over non-payment of domicile levy â¬200,000 levy aimed at high net-worth individuals who choose to live abroad for tax reasons A total of 60 wealthy individuals are under inquiry for not paying a â¬200,000 domicile levy aimed at extracting more tax from people who are Irish-domiciled but choose to live abroad for tax reasons. The levy was introduced by former minister for finance Brian Lenihan in the 2010 budget following concerns that high net-worth individuals were not paying their fair share of tax. The measure applies to individuals with a worldwide income of â¬1 million or more, Irish property assets worth more than â¬5 million and an annual income tax liability less than â¬200,000. Non-resident Latest figures show there are about 13,500 people who have filed income tax returns that indicate they are non-resident for income tax purposes. The vast majority are not high net- worth individuals. During the first year of the domicile levy â 2010 â just 11 individuals made tax returns in which they disclosed they were liable for the domicile levy, resulting in a tax yield of just over â¬1.6 million. This prompted Revenue to launch a targeted compliance programme last year aimed at wealthy people who had a possible requirement to pay the levy, but had not yet done so. Surge Since this occurred, there has been a surge in the number of people paying the tax retrospectively for previous years. Some 25 individuals have so far this year made returns in which they have paid the levy for previous years. In a statement, the Revenue said it has stepped up a compliance programme aimed at those who have not yet made returns but may have a liability. To date, it has issued inquiries to 60 individuals. It said this programme has resulted in additional returns and payments being received. Inquiries are still on-going in a number of cases. Introduced The measure was introduced following figures which showed that some of the wealthiest individuals in the country were paying minimal amounts of tax through use of tax-avoidance measures. Figures produced in the months before the levy was introduced showed that as many as 3,800 people who earned more than â¬100,000 paid no tax on their incomes. Latest Economy Return to results
Revenue tax settlements âbelow what could be dueâ Revenue tax settlements âbelow what could be dueâ The Revenue made two confidential settlements in 2012 where the amounts of tax paid was significantly below the â¬68 million that the Revenue thought could be due, according to the report. Photograph: Online News The Revenue made two confidential settlements in 2012 where the amounts of tax paid was significantly below the â¬68 million that the Revenue thought could be due, according to the report. In one case two Irish subsidiaries of an unidentified multinational made corporation tax payments in 2005 for 2004, prompting the Revenue to notice that they had not made returns for previous years. The companies lent money to their parent company and booked interest due, but not paid, as income. High Court In 2008 the Revenue raised assessments for â¬11.8 million for the pre-2004 period. When the Appeal Commissioner confirmed these assessments, the companies appealed that decision to the High Court. The Revenue estimate was that, with interest, it would get â¬14 million if it won the case. However before the case was heard, the issue was settled for â¬8 million. The settlement details, which were approved by a Revenue commissioner, were not published. In a second case an audit in 2011 led to a capital gains assessment for â¬22 million as a result of a transaction which the taxpayerâs agent said should not trigger a tax bill. The Revenue believed the transaction was motivated by tax avoidance rather than commercial objectives. With interest and potential penalties, the final bill for the taxpayer could have been as high as â¬54 million. During negotiations, where it was agreed the matter could take years if it went to court, the taxpayerâs agent offered to settle for â¬15 million. The settlement was approved by a Revenue commissioner in December 2012. No penalties were applied, and the details were not published. Penalties The C&AG report noted that there was nothing on the file to indicate that the Revenue made a claim for interest or penalties, or that it sought a figure of more than â¬15 million during the settlement negotiations. In response to queries from the C&AG, the Revenue pointed out that the taxpayer had offshore companies and that there was a danger of a âleakageâ of funds through them. Further revenues They also said there was a danger it could lose further revenues from the taxpayer depending on how the case was settled. In another chapter the C&AG looked at the amount of accumulated losses that exist and which can be used by companies against future corporation tax bills. Comments are closed for this article.
Rich pickings for hi-tech thieves Rich pickings for hi-tech thieves Viruses, trojans and other malicious programs sent on to the net to catch you out are undergoing a subtle change. The shift is happening as tech savvy criminals turn to technology to help them con people out of cash, steal valuable data or take over home PCs. Viruses written to make headlines by infecting millions are getting rarer. Instead programs are now crafted for directly criminal ends and firms are tightening up networks with defences to combat the new wave of malicious code. The growing criminal use of malware has meant the end of the neat categorisation of different sorts of viruses and malicious programs. Before now it has been broadly possible to name and categorise viruses by the method they use to spread and how they infect machines. But many of the viruses written by criminals roll lots of technical tricks together into one nasty package. "You cannot put them in to the neat little box that you used to," said Pete Simpson, head of the threat laboratory at security firm Clearswift. Now viruses are just as likely to spread by themselves like worms, or to exploit loopholes in browsers or hide in e-mail message attachments. "It's about outright criminality now," said Mr Simpson, explaining why this change has come about. He said many of the criminal programs came from Eastern Europe where cash-rich organised gangs can find a ready supply of technical experts that will crank out code to order. Former virus writer Marek Strihavka, aka Benny from the 29A virus writing group, recently quit the malware scene partly because it was being taken over by spyware writers, phishing gangs, and spammers who are more interested in money rather than the technology. No longer do virus writers produce programs to show off their technical prowess to rivals in the underground world of malware authors. Not least, said Paul King, principal security consultant at Cisco, because the defences against such attacks are so common. "In many ways the least likely way to do it is e-mail because most of us have got anti-virus and firewalls now," he said. Few of the malicious programs written by hi-tech thieves are cleverly written, many are much more pragmatic and use tried and tested techniques to infect machines or to trick users into installing a program or handing over important data. "If you think of criminals they do not do clever," said Mr King, "they just do what works." As the tactics used by malicious programs change, said Mr King, so many firms were changing the way they defend themselves. Now many scan machines that connect to the corporate networks to ensure they have not been compromised while off the core network. Many will not let a machine connect and a worker get on with their job before the latest patches and settings have been uploaded. As well as using different tactics, criminals also use technology for reasons that are much more transparent. "The main motivation now is money," said Gary Stowell, spokesman for St Bernard software. Mr Stowell said organised crime gangs were turning to computer crime because the risks of being caught were low and the rates of return were very high. With almost any phishing or spyware attack, criminals are guaranteed to catch some people out and have the contacts to exploit what they recover. So-called spyware was proving very popular with criminals because it allowed them to take over machines for their own ends, to steal key data from users or to hijack web browsing sessions to point people at particular sites. In some cases spyware was being written that searched for rival malicious programs on PCs it infects and then trying to erase them so it has sole ownership of that machine.

Rings of steel combat net attacks Rings of steel combat net attacks Gambling is hugely popular, especially with tech-savvy criminals. Many extortionists are targeting net-based betting firms and threatening to cripple their websites with deluges of data unless a ransom is paid. But now deep defences are being put in place by some of the UK's biggest net firms to stop these attacks. Increasing numbers of attacks and the huge amounts of data being used to try to bump a site off the web are prompting firms to adopt the measures. "Net firms are realising that it's not just about anti-virus and firewalls," said Paul King, chief security architect at Cisco. "There are more things that can be done in the network to protect data centres." Mr King said the only way to properly combat these so-called Distributed Denial-of-Service attacks was with intelligent net-based systems. Many of the gambling sites suffering DDoS attacks are in offshore data and hosting centres, so any large scale data flood could knock out access to many more sites than just the one the criminals were targeting, said Mr King. This overspill effect was only likely to grow as attacks grow in size and scale. Malcolm Seagrave, security expert at Energis, said the most common types of attacks hit sites with 10 megabytes of data over short periods of time. Bigger attacks sending down 200 megabytes of traffic or more were rarely seen, he said. "It does feel like they are turning the dial because you see this traffic gradually growing," he said. So far there have been no attacks involving gigabytes of data, said Mr Seagrave. However, he added that it was only a matter of time before such large attacks were mounted. Maria Capella, spokeswoman for net provider Pipex, said that when DDoS attacks were at their height, customers were getting hit every four to five days. The defences being put in place constantly monitor the streams of data flowing across networks and pluck out the traffic destined for target sites. "It's about understanding what's genuine traffic and keeping attack traffic from going to the site," she said. "We study the profile of their traffic and as soon as we see an anomaly in the profile that's when we start to get the backbone engineering boys to see if we are going to sustain an attack," said Ms Capella. This traffic can be hard to spot because DDoS attacks typically use thousands of computers in many different countries, each participating machine only sends a small part of the entire data flood. Typically these computers have been infected by a virus or worm which reports its success and the net address of compromised machines back to the malicious hacker or hi-tech criminal that set off the virus. Hijacked computers are known as zombies or 'bots and collections of them are called 'bot nets. Many spammers rent out 'bot nets to help them anonymously send junk mail. Most of the zombies are based outside the country that hosts the target site so getting the attacking PCs shut off can be difficult. Often Pipex and other net suppliers do get advance notice that an attack is about to happen. "The serious players tend to precede an attack with some kind of ransom e-mail," said Ms Capella. "We ask, as part of the service we provide, that customers notify us of anything they have in advance that would give us forewarning." Once an attack is spotted dedicated net hardware takes over to remove the attack traffic and ensure that sites stay up. Energis took a similar approach, said Mr Seagrave. "We have technology out there that allows us to detect attacks in minutes rather than let network engineers spend hours pulling the information together," said Mr Seagrave. Also net firms were starting to work more closely together on the problem of DDoS attacks and pool information about where they are coming from. Information gathered on attacks and where they originated has led to some arrests. He said Energis also did its own intelligence work to get in insight into which sites criminal gangs plan to target. "We have people in places where they shouldn't be, monitoring tech sites," he said. Sometimes though, he said, spotting the next victim was easy. "You can see them going alphabetically through the list with the gambling sites, trying one after another," said Mr Seagrave. Comments are closed for this article.
S&P cuts rating on Netherlands but upbeat on Spain S&P cuts rating on Netherlands but upbeat on Spain S&P says Dutch decision due to a worsening of growth prospects Children hoist the Spanish flag with Spanish legionnaires during a ceremony on the eve of the Spainâs National Day in Ronda, near Malaga. Spain is on a path of slow but stable economic recovery. Photograph: Jon Nazca / Online News Ratings agency Standard & Poorâs agency cut the Netherlandsâ credit rating on yesterday, reducing the euro zone club of full triple-A nations to just three, while rewarding Spain for efforts to reform its public finances. S&P lowered the Netherlands , which is suffering from an anaemic economy, slumping house prices and falling consumer confidence, to AA+ from AAA. This left Germany , Luxembourg and Finland as the only members of the 17-nation euro zone with the top rating from all three leading credit agencies. However, it raised the outlook for Spanish debt to stable from negative and upgraded bailed-out Cyprus , highlighting diverging fortunes within the common currency bloc. The credit rating agency said it still rated Spanish sovereign debt at triple B minus â only one notch above junk â but that there was now a much smaller chance of a further downgrade in the next two years. âWe see improvement in Spainâs external position as economic growth gradually resumes,â said an S&P statement. The change comes weeks after Fitch , another credit rating agency, made a similar move, shifting Spainâs credit outlook from ânegativeâ to âstableâ, and adding that the economy was now on a âsurer footingâ. Both actions reflect growing confidence among analysts and investors that Spain is on a path of slow but stable economic recovery, thanks to a surge in exports and the gradual restoration of competitiveness in the private sector after years of wage restraint and job losses. S&P said the Dutch decision was due to a worsening of growth prospects. âThe real GDP per capita trend growth rate is persistently lower than that of peers at similarly high levels of economic development,â the agency said, while affirming the Netherlandsâ short-term debt rating at A-1+. â Online News / The Financial Times Limited 2013 Comments are closed for this article.
Santy worm makes unwelcome visit Santy worm makes unwelcome visit Thousands of website bulletin boards have been defaced by a virus that used Google to spread across the net. The Santy worm first appeared on 20 December and within 24 hours had successfully hit more than 40,000 websites. The malicious program exploits a vulnerability in the widely used phpBB software. Santy's spread has now been stopped after Google began blocking infected sites searching for new victims. The worm replaces chat forums with a webpage announcing that the site had been defaced by the malicious program. Soon after being infected, sites hit by the worm started randomly searching for other websites running the vulnerable phpBB software. Once Google started blocking these search queries the rate of infection tailed off sharply. A message sent to Finnish security firm F-Secure by Google's security team said: "While a seven hour response for something like this is not outrageous, we think we can and should do better." "We will be reviewing our procedures to improve our response time in the future to similar problems," the Google team said. Security firms estimate that about 1m websites run their discussion groups and forums with the open source phpBB program. The worst of the attack now seems to be over as a search conducted on the morning of the 22 December produced only 1,440 hits for sites showing the text used in the defacement message. People using the sites hit by Santy will not be affected by the worm. Santy is not the first malicious program to use Google to help it spread. In July a variant of the MyDoom virus slowed down searches on Google as the program flooded the search site with queries looking for new e-mail addresses to send itself to.

Set your television to wow Set your television to wow Television started off as a magical blurry image. Then came the sharpness, the colour and the widescreen format. Now the TV set is taking another leap forward into a crystal clear future, although those in Europe will have to be patient. After years of buzz about high-definition TV (HDTV) it is finally taking off in a handful of countries around the world, mainly the US and Japan. If you believe the hype, then HDTV will so wow you, that you will never want to go back to your old telly. "HDTV is just the latest must-have technology in viewers' homes," says Jo Flaherty, a senior broadcaster with the CBS network in the US. All television images are made up of pixels, going across the screen, and scan lines going down. British TV pictures are made up of 625 lines and about 700 pixels. By contrast, HDTV offers up to 1,080 active lines, with each line made up of 1,920 pixels. The result is a picture which can be up to six times as sharp as standard TV. But to get the full impact, programmes need to be broadcast in this format and you need a HDTV set to receive them. Most new computer displays are already capable of handling high-resolution pictures. Viewers in Japan, the US, Australia, Canada and South Korea are already embracing the new TV technology, with a selection of primetime programmes being broadcast in the new format, which includes 5.1 digital surround sound. But TV viewers in Europe will have to wait to enjoy the eye-blasting high-definition images. Many high-end European TV programmes, such as the recent Athens Olympics, are already being produced in high-definition. But they still reach your screen in the old 625 lines. The prospects for getting sharper images soon do not seem very encouraging. According to consultants Strategy Analytics, only 12% of homes in Europe will have TVs capable of showing programmes in high-definition by 2008. But the HDTV hype spilling out of the US and Japan has spurred European broadcasters and consumer electronic companies to push for change. Big sports and entertainment events are set to help trigger the general public's attention. The 2006 World Cup in Germany will be broadcast in high-definition. In the UK, satellite broadcaster BSkyB is planning HDTV services in 2006. There is already a HDTV service in Europe called Euro1080. Other European broadcasters, especially in France and Germany, also aiming to launch similar services. In Britain, digital satellite and cable are largely seen as the natural home for HDTV, at least while a decision is taken regarding terrestrial broadcast options. The communications watchdog Ofcom could hand over some terrestrial frequencies freed up when the UK switches off its analogue TV signal. For now, broadcasters like the Online News are working on their own HDTV plans, although with no launch date in sight. "The Online News will start broadcasting in HDTV when the time is right, and it would not be just a showcase, but a whole set of programming," says Andy Quested, from the Online News's high-definition support group. "We have made the commitment to produce all our output in high-definition by 2010, which would put us on the leading edge." One of the options under consideration is to offer high-definition pictures on the web. The Online News has already dipped its toe into this, including some HDTV content in recent trials of its interactive media player - a video player for PCs. It is planning to offer special releases of selected flagship programmes online in the near future. According to Mr Quested, this could help put Europe back into the running in the race to switch to HDTV. This is backed by recent research which suggests that the number of Europeans with broadband has exploded over the past 12 months, with the web eating into TV viewing habits.

Slovenian and Greek troubles to dominate Eurogroup talks Slovenian and Greek troubles to dominate Eurogroup talks Fears Ljubljana will need euro zoneâs sixth bailout, while Athens may miss â¬2bn surplus target Slovenian prime minister Alenka Bratusek, whose government has pledged to avoid seeking official help from EU and IMF. Photograph: EPA/Andrius Ufartas Euro zone finance ministers meet today in Brussels amid mounting fears about the Slovenian economy, and continuing difficulties with the Greek bailout as the troika once again postponed a visit of its full review team to Athens. While significant progress was made on new bank resolution rules at a meeting on Friday in Berlin between German finance minister Wolfgang SchÃ¤uble and a select group of European finance ministers, ministers will today focus on the fiscal situation in specific euro zone countries, before turning to banking union at tomorrowâs meeting of all 28 European finance ministers. Potential sixth bailout Ministers will be updated by the Slovenian finance minister on the financial situation of the former Yugoslav state, which is battling to avoid becoming the sixth euro zone country to seek a bailout. The small country of two million people has been badly affected by falling exports, weak consumer spending and problem loans in its banking system. Results of stress tests on the countryâs banks, which are predominantly state-owned, are due later this week. While the government has pledged to inject â¬1.2 billion into its banking sector, it is expected that the banks will need about â¬5 billion. However, a senior eurogroup official stressed that euro zone officials believe such a figure âwould be manageableâ from Sloveniaâs own resources. The government of prime minister Alenka Bratusek , which has pledged to avoid seeking official help from EU and International Monetary Fund lenders, survived a confidence vote in the Slovenian parliament last month. Meanwhile, a European Commission spokesman confirmed that talks between Greek officials and the troika of international lenders will now not fully resume until January, though a reduced team will travel to Athens on Wednesday to resume technical discussions, amid continuing disagreements about the scale of adjustments needed for the Greek programme. While the Greek parliament passed its 2014 budget over the weekend, the eurogroup has yet to sign off on the latest instalment of Greeceâs rescue package, amid disagreements over the scale of Greeceâs fiscal gap for 2014. Austerity intolerance Greeceâs international lenders believe the country may miss its budget surplus target by â¬2 billion unless it finds new savings. This figure is disputed by Athens, which is opposed to imposing further austerity on a country that has already undergone severe economic retrenchment. Greece , which assumes the rotating presidency of the Council of the European Union in January, is approaching the end of its sixth year of recession. It has the highest unemployment rate in the euro zone, at over 27 per cent. The European Commission forecasts the countryâs debt to gross domestic product ratio will peak at 176 per cent this year. While the two Greek bailouts, worth about â¬240 billion, are due to end in a yearâs time, there are concerns that the country may need further funds, amid reports of a funding gap of up to â¬10 billion in its rescue programme.

Study, commissioned by MasterCard, outlines potential consequences of EC proposals Study, commissioned by MasterCard, outlines potential consequences of EC proposals The study suggests the changes could lead to annual shortfall of â¬107 million in funds to cover costs incurred in running Irelandâs card payments system. Photograph: Peter Macdiarmid/Getty Images Irish consumers could end up paying more than â¬100 million extra in annual credit and debit card fees under new European Commission proposals, a new study claims. The research, carried out by economist Anthony Foley on behalf of MasterCard , examined the potential consequences that could result from moves to reduce the contribution merchants make to funding the cost of card payments. The study suggests the changes could lead to annual shortfall of â¬107 million in funds to cover costs incurred in running Irelandâs card payments system. The knock-on effects of this, the report claims, would be additional annual charges of â¬89 million for credit card users and â¬18 million for debit card users in Ireland - equivalent to â¬42.50 per credit card and â¬4.60 per debit card. The report suggests the changes would also âact as a barrier to Government efforts to reduce the excessive role of cash and cheques in the Irish payments system,â the report said. It noted that a substantial move away from using cash and cheques - in line with the Governmentâs national payments plan - would provide a saving of over â¬1 billion per annum for the economy. Mr Foley said: âThe most important fact arising from the analysis is that over â¬100 million annually will be withdrawn from the Irish electronic payments system, over â¬500 million in five years.â âIt is very difficult to assume that such a large withdrawal would not have an adverse effect on the aim of bringing the payments system to best international practice.â âThe current EU intention to reduce interchange fees is clearly inappropriate for current and near future Irish economic and banking circumstances,â add Mr Foley. âThe Government should not support the proposed regulation without first undertaking a comprehensive analysis of the possible consequences on consumers, bank revenue and the wider economy.â In July, the Commission published a series of proposals to reduce the contribution merchants make to funding the cost of card payments as part of its regulatory approach to Europeâs electronic payments system. The proposals include a possible cap on interchange fees, which are the fees a retailerâs bank pays a consumerâs bank to cover a portion of the costs associated with card transactions such as payment guarantees, risks due to fraud and bad debt, and running the payments network.

T-Mobile bets on 'pocket office' T-Mobile bets on 'pocket office' T-Mobile has launched its latest "pocket office" third-generation (3G) device which also has built-in wi-fi - high-speed wireless net access. Unlike other devices where the user has to check which high-speed network is available to transfer data, the device selects the fastest one itself. The MDA IV, released in the summer, is an upgrade to the company's existing smartphone, the 2.5G/wi-fi MDA III. It reflects the push by mobile firms for devices that are like mini laptops. The device has a display that can be swivelled and angled so it can be used like a small computer, or as a conventional clamshell phone. The Microsoft Mobile phone, with two cameras and a Qwerty keyboard, reflects the design of similar all-in-one models released this year, such as Motorola's MPx. "One in five European workers are already mobile - meaning they spend significant time travelling and out of the office," Rene Obermann, T-Mobile's chief executive, told a press conference at the 3GSM trade show in Cannes. He added: "What they need is their office when they are out of the office." T-Mobile said it was seeing increasing take up for what it calls "Office in a Pocket" devices, with 100,000 MDAs sold in Europe already. In response to demand, T-Mobile also said it would be adding the latest phone-shaped Blackberry to its mobile range. Reflecting the growing need to be connected outside the office, it announced it would introduce a flat-fee Â£20 ($38) a month wi-fi tariff for people in the UK using its wi-fi hotspots. It said it would nearly double the number of its hotspots - places where wi-fi access is available - globally from 12,300 to 20,000. It also announced it was installing high-speed wi-fi on certain train services, such as the UK's London to Brighton service, to provide commuters a fast net connection too. The service, which has been developed with Southern trains, Nomad Digital (who provide the technology), begins with a free trial on 16 trains on the route from early March to the end of April. A full service is set to follow in the summer. Wi-fi access points will be connected to a Wimax wireless network - faster than wi-fi - running alongside the train tracks. Brian McBride, managing director of T-Mobile in the UK, said: "We see a growing trend for business users needing to access e-mail securely on the move. "We are able to offer this by maintaining a constant data session for the entire journey." He said this was something other similar in-train wi-fi services, such as that offered on GNER trains, did not offer yet. Mr Obermann added that the mobile industry in general was still growing, with many more opportunities for more services which would bear fruit for mobile companies in future. Thousands of mobile industry experts are gathered in Cannes, France, for the 3GSM which runs from 14 to 17 February. Return to results
T-Mobile bets on 'pocket office' (Update) T-Mobile bets on 'pocket office' T-Mobile has launched its latest "pocket office" third-generation (3G) device which also has built-in wi-fi - high-speed wireless net access. Unlike other devices where the user has to check which high-speed network is available to transfer data, the device selects the fastest one itself. The MDA IV, released in the summer, is an upgrade to the company's existing smartphone, the 2.5G/wi-fi MDA III. It reflects the push by mobile firms for devices that are like mini laptops. The device has a display that can be swivelled and angled so it can be used like a small computer, or as a conventional clamshell phone. The Microsoft Mobile phone, with two cameras and a Qwerty keyboard, reflects the design of similar all-in-one models released this year, such as Motorola's MPx. "One in five European workers are already mobile - meaning they spend significant time travelling and out of the office," Rene Obermann, T-Mobile's chief executive, told a press conference at the 3GSM trade show in Cannes. He added: "What they need is their office when they are out of the office." T-Mobile said it was seeing increasing take up for what it calls "Office in a Pocket" devices, with 100,000 MDAs sold in Europe already. In response to demand, T-Mobile also said it would be adding the latest phone-shaped Blackberry to its mobile range. Reflecting the growing need to be connected outside the office, it announced it would introduce a flat-fee Â£20 ($38) a month wi-fi tariff for people in the UK using its wi-fi hotspots. It said it would nearly double the number of its hotspots - places where wi-fi access is available - globally from 12,300 to 20,000. It also announced it was installing high-speed wi-fi on certain train services, such as the UK's London to Brighton service, to provide commuters a fast net connection too. The service, which has been developed with Southern trains, Nomad Digital (who provide the technology), begins with a free trial on 16 trains on the route from early March to the end of April.

TV calls after Carroll error TV calls after Carroll error Spurs boss Martin Jol said his team were "robbed" at Manchester United after Pedro Mendes' shot clearly crossed the line but was not given. "The referee is already wearing an earpiece so why can't we just stop the game and get the decision right," said Jol after the 0-0 draw. "But at the end of the day it's so obvious that Pedro's shot was over the line it's incredible. "We feel robbed but it's difficult for the linesman and referee to see it." Mendes shot from 50 yards and United goalkeeper Roy Carroll spilled the ball into his own net before hooking it clear. Jol added: "We are not talking about the ball being a couple of centimetres or an inch or two over the line, it was a metre inside the goal. "What really annoys me is that we are here in 2005, watching something on a TV monitor within two seconds of the incident occurring and the referee isn't told about it. "We didn't play particularly well but I am pleased - even now - with a point, although we should have had three." Mendes could not believe the 'goal' was not given after seeing a replay. He said: "My reaction on the pitch was to celebrate. "It was a very nice goal, it was clearly over the line - I've never seen one so over the line and not given in my career. "It's really, really over. What can you do but laugh about it? It's a nice goal and one to keep in my memory even though it didn't count. "It's not every game you score from the halfway line." Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson sympathised with Tottenham and said the incident highlighted the need for video technology. "I think it hammers home what a lot of people have been asking for and that's that technology should play a part in the game," Ferguson told MUTV. "What I was against originally was the time factor in video replays. "But I read an article the other day which suggested that if a referee can't make up his mind after 30 seconds of watching a video replay then the game should carry on. "Thirty seconds is about the same amount of time it takes to organise a free-kick or take a corner or a goal-kick. So you wouldn't be wasting a lot of time. "I think you could start off by using it for goal-line decisions. I think that would be an opening into a new area of football." Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger also used the incident to highlight the need for video technology. "When the whole world apart from the referee has seen there should be a goal at Old Trafford, that just reinforces what I feel - there should be video evidence," said Wenger. "It's a great example of where the referee could have asked to see a replay and would have seen in five seconds that it was a goal." Return to results
Text message record smashed Text message record smashed UK mobile owners continue to break records with their text messaging, with latest figures showing that 26 billion texts were sent in total in 2004. The figures collected by the Mobile Data Association (MDA) showed that 2.4 billion were fired off in December alone, the highest monthly total ever. That was 26% more than in December 2003. The records even surpassed the MDA's own predictions, it said. Every day 78 million messages are sent and there are no signs of a slow down. Before December's bumper text record, the previous highest monthly total was in October 2004, when 2.3 billion were sent. Text messaging is set to smash more records in 2005 too, said the MDA, with forecasts suggesting a total of 30 billion for the year. Even though mobiles are becoming increasingly sophisticated with much more multimedia applications, texting is still one of the most useful functions of mobiles. People are using SMS to do much more too. Booking cinema tickets, text voting, and news or sports text alerts are growing popular. Mobile owners have also given the chance to donate to the Disasters Emergency Committee's (DEC) Asian Tsunami fund by texting "Donate" to a simple short code number. Looking further ahead in the year, the MDA's chairman Mike Short, has predicted that more people will go online through their mobiles, estimating 15 billion WAP page impressions. Handsets with GPRS capability - an "always on" net connection - will rise to 75%, while 3G mobile ownership growing to five million by the end of 2005. These third generation mobiles offer a high-speed connection which means more data like video can be received on the phone. Globally, mobile phone sales passed 167 million in the third quarter of 2004, according to a recent report from analysts Gartner. That was 26% more than the previous year. It is predicted that there would be two billion handsets in use worldwide by the end of 2005. Return to results
The year search became personal The year search became personal The odds are that when you fire up your browser, you go straight to your favourite search engine, rather than type in a web address. Some may see this as the height of laziness, but in an era of information overload, search has become a vital tool in navigating the net. It is symptomatic of how the way we use the internet is changing. And as Google has shown, there is money in offering a service that people cannot live without. There is no shortage of companies vying for the loyalty of web searchers, offering a wealth of different services and tools to help you find what you want. Over the past 12 months, giants of the technology world such as Microsoft and Yahoo have sought to grab a slice of the search action. "User experience has contributed to people searching more," said Yonca Brunini of Yahoo. As people become more familiar with the internet, they tend to spend more time online and ask more queries, she said. "The other second thing is broadband," Ms Brunini told the Online News News website. "This will do to internet what colour has done to TV." But search is hardly a new phenomenon. It has been around since the early days of the net. Veteran surfers will remember old-timers like Hotbot and Altavista. "Search was always important," said Urs Holzle, Google vice-president of operations. "We trumpeted that in 1999. It is even truer now as there are more users and more information." "People didn't realise that search was the future. The financials have something to do with it." Google has shown web commerce can work through its targeted small adverts, which appear at the top and down the right-hand side of a page and are related to the original search. These small ads helped Google reach revenues of $805.9m for the three months to September. Others have woken up to the fact that you can make money out of web queries. "Once you see there is a market, Microsoft is bound to step to it. If Microsoft sees search as important, then nobody queries it," said Mr Holzle. Microsoft is just one of the net giants muscling in on search. Yahoo, Ask Jeeves, Amazon and a handful of smaller outfits are all seeking to capture eyeballs. Web users face a plethora of choices as each company tries to outflank Google by rolling out new search products such as desktop search. It reflects how the battlefield has shifted from the net to your PC. Search is not just about finding your way around the web. It is now about unlocking information hidden in the gigabytes of documents, images and music on hard drives. For all these advances, search is still a clumsy tool, often failing to come up with exactly what you had in mind. In order to do a better job, search engines are trying to get to know you better, doing a better job of remembering, cataloguing and managing all the information you come across. "Personalisation is going to be a big area for the future," said Yahoo's Yonca Brunini. "Whoever cracks that and gives you the information you want is going to be the winner. We have to understand you to give you better results that are tailored to you." This is perhaps the Holy Grail of search, understanding what it is you are looking for and providing it quickly. The problem is that no one yet knows how to get there. Comments are closed for this article.

US blogger fired by her airline US blogger fired by her airline A US airline attendant suspended over "inappropriate images" on her blog - web diary - says she has been fired. Ellen Simonetti, known as Queen of the Sky, wrote an anonymous semi-fictional account of her life in the sky. She was suspended by Delta in September. In a statement, she said she was initiating legal action against the airline for "wrongful termination". A Delta spokesperson confirmed on Wednesday that Ms Simonetti was no longer an employee. Delta has repeatedly declined to elaborate on what it calls "internal employee matters". A spokesperson reiterated this position on Wednesday, confirming only that Ms Simonetti was no longer with the company. The spokesperson also confirmed that there were "very clear rules" attached to the unauthorised use of Delta branding, including uniforms. Ms Simonetti announced on her blog she had been fired on 1 November. She said in an official statement: "As a result of my suspension and subsequent termination without cause by Delta Airlines I am moving forward with filing a discrimination complaint with the Federal Government EEOC [US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]." She added she had also hired a Texas-based law firm to initiate legal action for "wrongful termination, defamation of character and lost future wages." Ms Simonetti told the Online News News website she had received no warning or further explanation when she was suspended on 25 September. Queen of the Sky has received a lot of support and advice from the global blogging community since news of her suspension was brought to light on the Online News News website and others. Her story has highlighted concerns amongst the growing blogging community about conflicts of interest, employment law and free speech on personal websites. The blog, which she started in January as a way of getting over her mother's death, contains a mix of fictional and non-fictional accounts. Queen of the Sky developed over the months as a character in her own right, according to Ms Simonetti. In the postings, she made up fictional names for cities and other companies she mentioned to protect anonymity. But some postings contained images of herself in uniform. Of the 10 or so images only one showed Ms Simonetti's flight "wings". She removed them as soon as she was informed of her suspension. "I never meant it as something to harm my company and don't understand how they think it did harm them," Ms Simonetti said. A legal expert in the US speculated that Delta might be concerned that the fictional content on the blog may be linked back to the airline after the images were posted. Delta has been hit recently by pressures of rising fuel costs and fierce competition. It has said it needs to cut between 6,000 and 7,000 jobs and reduce costs by $5bn (Â£2.7bn) a year. Analysts had warned recently that the airline might have to seek Chapter 11 bankruptcy prevention. Last week, it struck a $1bn cost-cutting deal with its pilots which could save it from bankruptcy. The deal would see pilots accept a 32% pay cut in return for the right to buy 30 million Delta shares, unions said. And on Monday, it negotiated a deal to defer about $135m in debt which was due next year, until 2007. The airline also said it had agreed the terms of a $600m loan from American Express.

US state acts to stop 'spammers' US state acts to stop 'spammers' US state Texas has filed a lawsuit against two men believed to be among the world's top five spammers. It is seeking millions of dollars in damages in a civil lawsuit filed earlier this week. The Texas attorney general said it started the legal action as messages sent by the alleged spammers broke three laws governing e-mail marketing. The company named in the lawsuit denied any wrongdoing and said it complied with all relevant laws. The Texas lawsuit was filed against Ryan Samuel Pitylak, a University ofTexas student, and Mark Stephen Trotter of California. Both are thought to be the top executives in three companies - PayPerAction LLC., Leadplex LLC. and Leadplex Inc - that are suspected of sending out many millions of unwanted e-mail messages. "Illegal spam must be stopped," said Greg Abbott, Texas attorney general announcing the legal action. "Spam is one of the most aggravating and pervasive problems facing consumers today." The attorney general alleges that messages sent by Mr Pitylak and Mr Trotter's companies broke the 2003 Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act (Can-Spam) as well as the Texas Electronic Mail and Solicitation Act and Texas Deceptive Trade Practices Act. All three acts confer cash penalties for each violation of their terms. If the men are found guilty and all penalties are applied, the two men could face a damages bill running into millions. Mr Abbott said the messages sent by the pair broke laws by using misleading subject lines, not identifying themselves as adverts and offering services for which they had no licence to do so in Texas. Lawyers for the alleged spammers said the lawsuit was groundless and the two men would defend themselves strongly against the accusations. "Leadplex and PayPerAction are legitimate internet marketing companies that are in complete compliance with the federal Can-Spam Act," said Lin Hughes, speaking on behalf of Mr Pitylak and Mr Trotter. In a similar move the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has won a court order that stops an international group of spammers sending sexually explicit e-mail. The FTC took the action because the messages being sent violated several parts of the CAN-Spam Act. In particular, the pornographic messages did not identify themselves as being sexually explicit, had deceptive subject headings, did not have working opt-out mechanisms, failed to mention they were adverts and did not give the sender's real world address. The court order stops the spammers sending e-mail and freezes assets prior to a hearing on a permanent injunction. Return to results
US top of supercomputing charts US top of supercomputing charts The US has pushed Japan off the top of the supercomputing chart with IBM's prototype Blue Gene/L machine. It is being assembled for the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, under the US Department of Energy. IBM test results show that Blue Gene/L has managed speeds of 70.72 teraflops. The previous top machine, Japan's NEC Earth Simulator, clocked up 35.86. The Top 500 list was announced on Monday and officially charts the fastest computers in the world. It is announced every six months and is worked out using an officially recognised mathematical speed test called Linpack which measures calculations per second. Once completed in 2005, Blue Gene/L will be more powerful than its current prototype. "Next year with the final Blue Gene, four times what it is this year, it is going to be a real step up and will be hard to beat," said Erich Strohmaier, one of the co-founders of the Top500 list. It will help scientists work out the safety, security and reliability requirements for the US's nuclear weapons stockpile, without the need for underground nuclear testing. It will also cut down on the amount of heat generated by the massive power, a big problem for supercomputers. In second place was Silicon Graphics' Columbia supercomputer based at the US space agency's (Nasa) Ames Research Center in California. The Linux-based machine was reported to have reached a top speed of 42.7 trillion calculations per second (teraflops) in October. It will be used to model flight missions, climate research, and aerospace engineering. The defeated Japanese contender, the Earth Simulator, which was listed in third place, losing the top spot it had held since June 2002. It is dedicated to climate modelling and simulating seismic activity. Since the first supercomputer, the Cray-1, was installed at Los Alamos National Laboratory, US, in 1976, computational speed has leaped 500,000 times. The Cray-1 was capable of 80 megaflops (80 million operations a second). The Blue Gene/L machine that will be completed next year will be five million times faster. Started in 1993, the Top 500 list is decided by a group of computer science academics from around the world. It is presented at the International Supercomputer Conference in Pittsburgh.

Warning of 15% increase in the cost of health cover Warning of 15% increase in the cost of health cover Average family could pay â¬328 more next year after stamp duty rise and tax relief cut Minister for Health James Reilly announced that the stamp duty on most health insurance products is to rise by 14 per cent from next March Health insurance customers have been warned to expect premium hikes of up to 15 per cent as a result of rule changes announced by Minister for Health James Reilly and budget reductions in tax relief on premiums. Dr Reilly announced yesterday that the stamp duty on most health insurance products is to rise by 14 per cent from March. An average family with two children will pay an extra â¬328 in premiums next year as a result of yesterdayâs change and the budget cuts in tax relief, insurer GloHealth estimated. The duty, which is used to fund credits to the various insurers according to the age profile of their customers, is being increased from â¬350 to â¬399 per adult with advanced cover, and â¬120 to â¬135 per child. The change will affect more than 80 per cent of customers who have advanced cover for private and public hospitals. VHI to benefit most The VHI will benefit most from the changes to credits because it has the highest proportion of older customers. The three privately owned insurers will be hardest hit because their customer base is younger. Dr Reilly said he was reluctant to recommend increases in stamp duty, given the pressures many households face. âHowever, my priority is to direct support where it is most needed and these revised risk equalisation credits will subsidise health insurance for our most vulnerable patients,â he said. GloHealth chief executive Jim Dowdall said: âIt is farcical, bizarre and absurd that the Minister continually calls on health insurers to drive down costs when Government policies have been the overwhelming driver of rising premiums in recent years.â Risk equalisation is the system whereby companies with older customers with higher claims costs are compensated by rivals with a younger client case. Inflationary effect Dermot Goode of Cornmarket Healthcare Division said the changes announced by the Minister would have an inflationary effect even though the stamp duty was not levied on consumers, because insurers were likely to pass on the increases. âConsumers are going to get clobbered. Between this and the cuts in tax relief announced in last monthâs budget, itâs likely that premium increases of between 10 and 15 per cent are coming down the line,â he said. Insurances companies are also under pressure to fund an extra â¬30 million a year being demanded by the Department of Health from next year in respect of the use by private patients of public beds in the public health system, he said. Mr Goode estimated that the budget changes added up to â¬270 a year to the cost of the VHIâs Plan B Options policy, and â¬170 to Plan B. Customers on âgold-platedâ plans, as they were called by Minister for Finance Michael Noonan in his budget-day speech, will have to pay an extra â¬470-â¬780 a year. Return to results
Web helps collect aid donations Web helps collect aid donations The web is helping aid agencies gather resources to help cope with the aftermath of the tsunami disaster. Many people are making donations via websites or going online to see how they can get involved with aid efforts. High-profile web portals such as Google, Yahoo, Ebay and Amazon are gathering links that lead people to aid and relief organisations. So many were visiting some aid-related sites that some webpages were struggling to cope with the traffic. An umbrella organisation called the Disasters Emergency Committee (DEC) has been set up by a coalition of 12 charities and has been taking many donations via its specially created website. It urged people to go online where possible to help because donations could be processed more quickly than cash donated in other ways, meaning aid could be delivered as quickly as possible. The site has so far received almost Â£8 million, with more than 11,000 donations being made online every hour. Telco BT stepped in to take over the secure payments on the DEC site and provided extra logistical support for phone and online appeals after it was initially crippled with online donations. It has also provided space in London's BT tower for one of the call centres dealing with donations. Some of the web's biggest firms are also helping to channel help by modifying their homepages to include links to aid agencies and organisations collecting resources. On its famously sparse homepage Google has placed a link that leads users to a list of sites where donations can be made. Among the 17 organisations listed are Oxfam, Medecins sans Frontieres (Doctors Without Borders) and Network for Good. Many of the sites that Google lists are also taking online donations. Online retailer Amazon has put a large message on its start page that lets people donate money directly to the American Red Cross that will be used with relief efforts. Auction site eBay is giving a list of sites that people can either donate directly to, divert a portion of their profits from anything they sell on eBay to the listed organisations or simply buy items that direct cash to those in the list. Yahoo is proving links direct to charities for those that want to donate. The Auction Drop website is asking people to donate old digital cameras, computers and other gadgets they no longer want that can be auction to raise cash for the aid effort. Sadly, the outpouring of goodwill has also encouraged some conmen to try to cash in. Anti-fraud organisations are warning about e-mails that are starting to circulate which try to convince people to send money directly to them rather than make donations via aid agencies. Those wanting to give cash were urged to use legitimate websites of charities and aid agencies. Comments are closed for this article.
Wenger keeping faith with Almunia Wenger keeping faith with Almunia Arsene Wenger has pledged to keep faith with stand-in keeper Manuel Almunia for the crunch week which could define Arsenal's season. Almunia will start Tuesday's Champions League group tie against Rosenborg and is likely to face Chelsea on Sunday. Wenger said: "You don't think I would take out one goalkeeper for just one game, do you? I don't do that. "I have to give him a run for a few games. It's just that I don't want to make this story bigger than it is." Wenger insists he has complete faith in the 27-year-old Spaniard, who was signed last summer from Celta Vigo as back-up to Jens Lehmann. "If you look at my career, you will see that I have left many big players out for a long time. I've done it with Dennis Bergkamp, Kanu, everybody. "It's because it's a goalkeeper, that's all. It's a usual situation for me. You put your best team out, no matter who it is. "For me, it was not a big mistake at Old Trafford and I wasn't alarmed by what happened against Birmingham either. "It's nothing against Lehmann. I think he's a great keeper, as is Almunia. You can only play one of them. "These people are not robots - they have good periods and less good periods. Just because Lehmann doesn't play for two or three weeks, or longer or shorter, it doesn't mean I've lost faith in him." But former Arsenal keeper David Seaman believes Lehmann has been harshly treated. Seaman told the Daily Mail: "Jens is a fantastic keeper. He deserves another chance. "He has made a few mistakes but on form he deserves to be the first-team choice." With Arsenal hit by injuries and suspension, inexperienced midfield pair of Mathieu Flamini and Cesc Fabregas will line up against Rosenborg but Wenger is confident they will prove more than capable. "It puts a lot of pressure on them but it's a good learning process," said Wenger. "I'm not worried as they are both mentally strong and will put in the needed workrate." The Gunners go into the game boosted by the news that defender Sol Campbell is on the verge of signing a new deal with the club. And the 30-year-old, whose current contract runs out in the summer, has made it clear he is determined to achieve Champions League success with Arsenal. Campbell said: "It means a lot to me to go through, it's everything. We want to carry on in this competition. "That's where the best teams in Europe are. To be in there, playing against these guys and trying to win the trophy, is the first thing in my mind." Meanwhile, Thierry Henry believes he will be blamed if Arsenal fail to qualify for the next stage of the Champions League. Henry will captain the side in place of the suspended Patrick Vieira as the Gunners seek the required victory over Rosenborg. And the striker said: "If we don't win and we go out of the competition, like it or not, it's going to be my fault. That's the way it is. "If the team don't win I know I will be criticised, no matter how I play." Return to results
Wenger offers Mutu hope Wenger offers Mutu hope Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger would consider signing Adrian Mutu once the striker has served his drugs ban. Mutu was sacked by Chelsea on Friday after testing positive for cocaine - a move Wenger has backed. But he said: "I don't even wonder if that could happen because I think he will be suspended for a long period. "But once he has served his suspension, he has the right again to start from zero. I would then meet the player and see what he tells me." Mutu faces a ban of between six months and two years when the Football Association decides on his punishment. Chelsea decided to act before his case was heard and sacked the striker on grounds of gross misconduct after it was revealed that he had failed a drug test. But Mutu has hit out at the club's decision, saying: "Chelsea have destroyed me." He told the Sunday Mirror: "I don't know what I'm going to do. I am shocked and surprised by their decision. "I didn't expect them to pay me while I was suspended but I never thought they would sack me either. "Why didn't they wait to do this? Now my career is in ruins. "I might as well walk away from football. What is there left for me?" Chelsea have been criticised for their stance, with the Professional Footballers' Association accusing the club of failing in their duty of care to the player. And Mutu agreed, adding: "It is unfair. If they were going to sack me they should have done it afterwards. "Why did they go public? To make an example of me? It makes it very difficult for me now."
When technology gets personal When technology gets personal In 2020, whipping out your mobile phone to make a call will be quaintly pass&#233;. By then phones will be printed directly on to wrists, or other parts of the body, says Ian Pearson, BT's resident futurologist. It's all part of what's known as a "pervasive ambient world", where "chips are everywhere". Mr Pearson does not have a crystal ball. His job is to formulate ideas based on what science and technology are doing now, to guide industries into the future. Inanimate objects will start to interact with us: we will be surrounded - on streets, in homes, in appliances, on our bodies and possibly in our heads - by things that "think". Forget local area networks - these will be body area networks. Ideas about just how smart, small, or even invisible, technology will get are always floating around. Images of devices clumsily bolted on to heads or wrists have pervaded thinking about future technology. But now a new vision is surfacing, where smart fabrics and textiles will be exploited to enhance functionality, form, or aesthetics. Such materials are already starting to change how gadgets and electronics are used and designed. So MP3 players - the mass gadget of the moment - will disappear and instead become integrated into one's clothing, says Mr Pearson. "So the gadgets that fill up your handbag, when we integrate those into fabric, we can actually get rid of all that stuff. You won't necessarily see the electronics." Wearable technology could exploit body heat to charge it up, while "video tattoos", or intelligent electronic contact lenses, might function as TV screens for those on the move. However, this future of highly personal devices, where technology is worn, or even fuses with the body itself, raises ethical questions. If technology is going to be increasingly part of clothing, jewellery, and skin, there needs to be some serious thinking about what it means for us as humans, says Baroness Susan Greenfield. At a recent conference for technology, engineering, academic and fashion industry experts, at the Royal Society in London, neuroscientist Baroness Greenfield cautioned we "can't just sleepwalk into the future". Yet this technology is already upon us. Researchers have developed computers and sensors worn in clothing. MP3 jackets, based on the idea that electrically conductive fabric can connect to keyboard sewn into sleeves, have already appeared in shops. These "smart fabrics" have come about through advances in nano- and micro-engineering - the ability to manipulate and exploit materials at micro or molecular scale. At the nanoscale, materials can be "tuned" to display unusual properties that can be exploited to build faster, lighter, stronger and more efficient devices and systems. The textile and clothing industry has been one of the first to exploit nanotechnology in quite straightforward ways. Many developments are appearing in real products in the fields of medicine, defence, healthcare, sports, and communications. Professional swimming suits reduce drag by incorporating tiny structures similar to shark skin. Nanoscale titanium dioxide (TiO2) coatings give fabrics antibacterial and anti-odour properties. These have special properties which can be activated in contact with the air or UV light. Such coatings have already been used to stop socks smelling for instance, to turn airline seats into super stain-resistant surfaces, and applied to windows so they clean themselves. Dressings for wounds can now incorporate nanoparticles with biocidal properties and smart patches are being developed to deliver drugs through the skin. But Baroness Greenfield is concerned about how far this more personal contact with technology might affect our very being. If our clothing, skin, and "personal body networks" do the talking and the monitoring, everywhere we go, we have to think about what that means for our concept of privacy. Mr Pearson picks up the theme, pointing out there are a lot of issues humans have to iron out before we become "cyborgian". His main concern is "privacy". "We are looking at electronics which are really in deep contact with your body and a lot of that information you really don't want every passer-by to know. "So we have to make sure we build security in this. If you are wearing smart make-up, where electronics are controlling the appearance, you don't want people hacking in and writing messages on your forehead." As technology infiltrates our biology, how will our brains function differently? "We cannot arrogantly assume that the human brain will not change with this," warns Baroness Greenfield. There have already been successful experiments to grow human nerve cells on circuit boards. This paves the way for brain implants to help paralysed people interface directly with computers. Clearly, the organic, carbon of our bodies and silicon is increasingly merging. The cyborg - a very familiar part-human, part-inorganic science fiction and academic idea - is on its way.

Who do you think you are? Who do you think you are? The real danger is not what happens to your data as it crosses the net, argues analyst Bill Thompson. It is what happens when it arrives at the other end. The Financial Services Authority has warned banks and other financial institutions that members of criminal gangs may be applying for jobs which give them access to confidential customer data. The fear is not that they will steal money from our bank accounts but that they will instead steal something far more valuable in our digital society - our identities. Armed with the personal details that a bank holds, plus a fake letter or two, it is apparently easy to get a loan, open a bank account with an overdraft or get a credit card in someone else's name. And it is then a simple matter to move the money into another account and leave the unwitting victim to sort out the mess when statements and demands for payment start arriving. Identity theft is an increasingly significant economic crime, and we are all becoming more aware of the dangers of leaving bills, receipts and bank statements unshredded in our rubbish. But, however careful you may be, if the organisations you trust with your personal data, bank accounts and credit cards are not able to look after their databases properly then you are in trouble. It is surprising that it has taken the gangs so long to realise that a well-placed insider is by far the simplest way to break the security of a computer system. In fact, I suspect that the FSA is probably very late to this particular party and that this sort of thing has been going on for rather a long time. Has anyone checked Bob Cratchit's family links to the criminal underworld, I wonder? And it is hardly likely to be only banks that are being targeted. Health authorities, government agencies and of course the big e-commerce sites like Amazon must also offer rich pickings for the fraudsters. The good news is that better auditing is likely to catch out those who access account details that they are not supposed to. And as we all become aware of the danger of identity theft and look more carefully for unexpected transactions on our statements, banks should have good enough records and logs to trace the people who might have accessed the account details. Fortunately there are now ways to keep bank systems more secure from the sort of data theft that involves taking a portable hard drive or flash memory card into the office, plugging it into a USB slot and sucking down customer files. Companies like SecureWave, for example, can restrict the use of USB ports just to authorised devices or even to an individual's personal memory card. These solutions are not perfect, but it does not feel like a wave of fraud is about to wash away the entire financial system. However the warning does highlight one of the major issues with e-commerce and online trading - the security or otherwise of the servers and other systems that make up the 'back office'. It has been clear for years that the real danger in paying for goods online with a credit card is not that the number will be intercepted in transit but that the shop you are dealing with will be hacked. In fact I do not know of a single case where an e-mail containing payment details has led to card fraud. There are simply too many e-mails passing over the net for interception to be a sensible tool for anyone out to commit fraud. CD Universe, Powergen and many other companies have left their databases open and suffered the consequences. And just last week the online bank Cahoot admitted that its customer account details could be read by anyone who could guess a login name. Whether it is external hackers breaking in because of poor system security or internal staff abusing the access they get as part of their job, the issue is the same: how do we make sure that our personal data is not abused? Any organisation that processes personal data is, of course, bound by the Data Protection Act and must take proper care of it. Unauthorised disclosure is not allowed, but the penalties are small and the process of prosecuting under the Act so convoluted as to be worthless in practice. This is not something we can just leave it to the market. The consequences of having one's identity stolen are too serious, and markets respond too slowly. After all, I bank with Cahoot but it would be so much hassle to move my accounts that I did not even consider it when I heard about their security problems. I doubt many others have closed their accounts, especially when there is little guarantee that other banks are not going to make the same sort of mistake in future. The two options would seem to be more stringent data protection law, so that companies really feel the pressure to improve their internal processes, or a wave of civil lawsuits against financial institutions with sloppy practices whose customers suffer from identity theft. I have never felt comfortable with the US practice of suing everything that moves, partly because it seems to make lawyers richer than their clients, so I know which I'd prefer.

Advisers warn against âwatering down or rolling back reformsâ Advisers warn against âwatering down or rolling back reformsâ As coalition talks continue, Germanyâs so-called five economic wise men expressed concern yesterday that Christian Democratic Union leader Dr Angela Merkelâs third administration would be more interested in economic redistribution than ongoing reform. Photograph: Krisztian Bocsi/Online News Germanyâs state economic advisers yesterday dismissed recapitalising EU banks from the European Stability Mechanism bailout fund and attacked as spendthrift the spending plans of Berlinâs incoming grand coalition. As coalition talks continue, Germanyâs so-called five economic wise men â in fact, four men and one woman â expressed concern yesterday that Christian Democratic Union leader Dr Angela Merkelâs third administration would be more interested in economic redistribution than ongoing reform. âWeâre warning against watering down or rolling back reforms of the last years, what we need is economic growth and sustainable public finances,â said Dr Christoph Schmidt, the chairman of the committee that provides seasonal economic reports to the federal government. Challenges The looming challenges facing Germany , in particular involving its demographic make-up, would be more difficult to master, he warned, if the new government watered down decade-old economic reforms. âRedistribution and taking it easy on past successes wonât work,â he added. The 500-page report, the wise menâs most critical in years, attacked â¬20 billion in proposed additional pension spending. Four of the five economists also attacked as âfrivolousâ Social Democrat (SPD) demands for an â¬8.50 statutory minimum wage as a condition for joining a new coalition. The economists warned the move risked destroying jobs, particularly in eastern Germany. Dissension Economist Peter Bofinger said â¬8.50 was manageable as a minimum wage, however, pointing out that Germany is one of the last western countries not to have one. âThere are many studies for Germany which show there would be no effect on the labour market,â he said. The economists backed Berlinâs strategy for a strict âliability cascadeâ to ensure creditors and owners of failing banks are tapped first for funding, then national governments and, only in the medium or long-term, European funds. If the looming European bank stress test reveal gaps in bank finances, they said, the ESM fund should only be tapped as a last resort, with national governments acting as guarantors. âWe are against a direct recapitalisation of banks via the ESM and we think, in the medium to long term, we wonât have the conditions for this,â said Prof Claudia Buch. The economists forecast a brightening in Germanyâs economic prospects next year: 1.6 per cent after growth of just 0.4 per cent this year. Comments are closed for this article.

Apple iPod family expands market Apple iPod family expands market Apple has expanded its iPod family with the release of its next generation of the digital music players. Its latest challenges to the growing digital music gadget market include an iPod mini model which can hold 6GB compared to a previous 4GB. The company, which hopes to keep its dominant place in the digital music market, also said the gold coloured version of the mini would be dropped. A 30GB version has also been added to the iPod Photo family. The latest models have a longer battery life and their prices have been cut by an average of Â£40. The original iPod took an early lead in the digital music player market thanks to its large storage capacity and simple design. During 2004 about 25 million portable players were sold, 10 million of which were Apple iPods. But analysts agree that the success is also down to its integration with the iTunes online store, which has given the company a 70% share of the legal download music market. Mike McGuire, a research director at analyst Gartner, told the Online News News website that Apple had done a good job in "sealing off the market from competition" so far. "They have created a very seamless package which I think is the idea of the product - the design, function and the software are very impressive," he said. He added that the threat from others was always present, however. "Creative, other Microsoft-partnered devices, Real, Sony and so on, are ratcheting up the marketing message and advertising," he said. Creative was very upbeat about how many of its Creative Zen players it had shipped by the end of last year, he said. Its second-generation models, like the Creative Zen Micro Photo, is due out in the summer. It will have 5GB of memory on board. Digital music players are now the gadget of choice among young Americans, according to recent research by the Pew Internet and American Life Project. One in 10 US adults - 22 million people - now owns a digital music player of some sort. Sales of legally downloaded songs also rose more than tenfold in 2004, according to the record industry, with 200 million tracks bought online in the US and Europe in 12 months. The IFPI industry body said that the popularity of portable music players was behind the growth. Analysts say that the ease of use and growth of music services available on the net will continue to drive the trend towards portable music players. People are also starting to use them in novel ways. Some are combining automatic syncing functions many of them have with other net functions to automatically distribute DIY radio shows, called podcasts. But 2005 will also see more competition from mobile phone operators who are keen to offer streaming services on much more powerful and sophisticated handsets. According to Mr McGuire, research suggests that people like the idea of building up huge libraries of music, which they can do with high-capacity storage devices, like iPods and Creative Zens. Mobiles do not yet have this capacity though, and there are issues about the ease of portability of mobile music. Mr McGuire said Apple was ensuring it kept a foot in the mobile music door with its recent deal with Motorola to produce a version of iTunes for Motorola phones. Comments are closed for this article.
Ask Jeeves joins web log market Ask Jeeves joins web log market Ask Jeeves has bought the Bloglines website to improve the way it handles content from web journals or blogs. The Bloglines site has become hugely popular as it gives users one place in which to read, search and share all the blogs they are interested in. Ask Jeeves said it was not planning to change Bloglines but would use the 300 million articles it has archived to round out its index of the web. How much Ask Jeeves paid for Bloglines was not revealed. Bloglines has become popular because it lets users build a list of the blogs they want to follow without having to visit each journal site individually. To do this it makes use of a technology known as Really Simple Syndication (RSS) that many blogs have adopted to let other sites know when new entries are made on their journals. The acquisition follows similar moves by other search sites. Google acquired Pyra Labs, makers of the Blogger software, in 2003. In 2004 MSN introduced its own blog system and Yahoo has tweaked its technology to do a better job of handling blog entries. Jim Lanzone, vice president of search properties at Ask Jeeves in the US, said it did not acquire Bloglines just to get a foothold in the blog publishing world. He said Ask Jeeves was much more interested in helping people find information they were looking for rather than helping them write it. "The universe of readers is vastly larger than the universe of writers," he said. Mr Lanzone said the acquisition would sit well with Ask's My Jeeves service which lets people customise their own web experience and build up a personal collection of useful links. "Search engines are about discovering information for the first time and RSS is the ideal way to keep track of and monitor those sites," he said. It would also help drive information and entries from blogs to the portals that Ask Jeeves operates. There would be no instant sweeping changes to Bloglines, said Mr Lanzone. "Our intent is to take our time to figure out the right business model not to try to monetise it right away," he said. Though Mr Lanzone added that Ask Jeeves would be helping organise the database of 300m blog entries Bloglines holds with its own net indexing technology. "Being able to search the blogosphere as one corpus of information will be very useful in its own right," said Mr Lanzone. Rumours about the acquisition were broken by the Napsterization weblog which said it got the hint from Ask Jeeves insiders.
Bank guarantee almost universally slated but was the least worst solution Bank guarantee almost universally slated but was the least worst solution Opinion: Critics have failed to supply evidence that other solutions would have worked Anglo Irish Bank: default was imminent and it was felt that other banks would also soon be in deep trouble. Donal Donovan Five years on from the bank guarantee decision of September 29th, 2008, debate continues to rage as to the role it played in Irelandâs financial and economic crisis. To many, the guarantee was a fatal error that led to a ballooning of Irelandâs debt and imposed huge costs on the citizenry for years to come. This paradigm is simplistic and misleading. The big mistake was not the guarantee but the earlier policy errors and misjudgments that led to the property bubble, insolvency of the banking system and Irelandâs budgetary collapse. Defending the guarantee does not in any way imply a defence of these catastrophic failures. The critical element underlying the guarantee decision was the firm view that no Irish bank could be allowed to fail, that is, closing its doors and defaulting on liabilities. Contrary to some assertions, this stance was not a diktat of the European Central Bank . It was the unambiguous policy of the Irish authorities ever since the UK Northern Rock crisis in mid-2007. This policy was based on the experiences of widespread bank failures elsewhere that caused economic and financial chaos, in some cases (most recently in Argentina and Indonesia) accompanied by major social and political unrest, including violence and deaths. As panic began to engulf financial markets world wide during September 2008 (including in Dublin), there was a firm conviction that any Irish bank could not be allowed to become the Lehman Brothers of Europe . Careful examination Those who have forcefully criticised the decision have yet to present convincing arguments in favour of specific other options that would have succeeded in preventing a collapse of the Irish financial system at significantly less cost. Careful examination of all the possibilities available at the time leads one to conclude, as did the Honohan and Nyberg reports (and my recent book jointly authored with Antoin Murphy), that some form of comprehensive guarantee could not have been avoided â it was the least worst alternative. Some have suggested that the decision should have been delayed in order to seek some better solution, perhaps involving European partners. However, faced with imminent default by Anglo Irish Bank the following morning and the prospect that the other banks would then very rapidly face similar intolerable liquidity pressures, it was imperative to take decisive and unambiguous steps that would be easily understood by the markets and restore confidence quickly. In the absence of such action, it is very likely that, after a short period of intense turmoil, the government would have been forced to introduce some form of guarantee. Meanwhile, Irelandâs financial reputation would have incurred incalculable damage. Nor was there any reason to believe in 2008 that the ECB would alter its firm position that no bank should be permitted to fail and that the responsibility for intervention lay with national governments. Indeed in the subsequent five years no euro zone bank has failed apart from Cyprus recently. Moreover, possible pan- European arrangements that could involve burden sharing in dealing with troubled banks are still quite far from being agreed. .

Bitter Santini hits out at Spurs Bitter Santini hits out at Spurs Former Tottenham coach Jacques Santini said he quit partly because he felt agreements with the club were broken. Santini, 52, left in November after just 13 games in charge amid tensions with sporting director Frank Arnesen. "They promised me a big apartment on the beach and I found myself 200m from the sea with a view of my neighbours," he told France's Journal di Dimanche. But the ex-France coach admitted he "dug his own grave" by agreeing to join the club before the end of Euro 2004. "My only regret is having signed too early (for Tottenham). I should have waited until after Euro 2004 even if that means I might have missed my chance," he said. Santini also said he was not given enough information about Spurs' transfer policy. "I learned on the day of our team photo that our captain (Stephen Carr) was leaving the club," he said. Comments are closed for this article.
Blind student 'hears in colour' Blind student 'hears in colour' A blind student has developed software that turns colours into musical notes so that he can read weather maps. Victor Wong, a graduate student from Hong Kong studying at Cornell University in New York State, had to read coloured maps of the upper atmosphere as part of his research. To study "space weather" Mr Wong needed to explore minute fluctuations in order to create mathematical models. A number of solutions were tried, including having a colleague describe the maps and attempting to print them in Braille. Mr Wong eventually hit upon the idea of translating individual colours into music, and enlisted the help of a computer graphics specialist and another student to do the programming work. "The images have three dimensions and I had to find a way of reading them myself," Mr Wong told the Online News News website. "For the sake of my own study - and for the sake of blind scientists generally - I felt it would be good to develop software that could help us to read colour images." He tried a prototype version of the software to explore a photograph of a parrot. In order to have an exact reference to the screen, a pen and tablet device is used. The software then assigns one of 88 piano notes to individually coloured pixels - ranging from blue at the lower end of this scale to red at the upper end. Mr Wong says the application is still very much in its infancy and is only useful for reading images that have been created digitally. "If I took a random picture and scanned it and then used my software to recognise it, it wouldn't work that well." Mr Wong has been blind from the age of seven and he thinks that having a "colour memory" makes the software more useful than it would be to a scientist who had never had any vision. "As the notes increase in pitch I know the colour's getting redder and redder, and in my mind's eye a patch of red appears." The colour to music software has not yet been made available commercially, and Mr Wong believes that several people would have to work together to make it viable. But he hopes that one day it can be developed to give blind people access to photographs and other images. Return to results
Breast cancer risk cut by daily hour-long walk, study finds Breast cancer risk cut by daily hour-long walk, study finds Research on postmenopausal women finds disease risk can be lowered by 14 % Women who walk for an hour a day can cut their chance of breast cancer by 14 per cent, a study has found. Photograph: Chris Ison/PA Wire Women who walk for an hour a day can cut their chance of breast cancer by 14 per cent, a study has found. While it is well known that being active cuts risk of the disease, this is the first study to specifically look at the effect of walking. The American Cancer Society study involved 73,615 postmenopausal women, of whom 4,760 were diagnosed with breast cancer during a 17-year follow-up. The researchers found that moderate activity in the form of walking an hour a day was associated with a 14 per cent lower risk of the disease compared to women who were least active. Among all women in the group, 47 per cent said walking was their only recreational activity and women were far more likely to take part in walking, dancing or aerobics than vigorous activities like running, swimming, and tennis. Among those women who reported walking as their only activity, those who walked at least seven hours per week had a 14 per cent lower risk of breast cancer compared to those who walked three or fewer hours per week. The study also found that women who took part in more vigorous activities for an hour a day had a 25 per cent lower risk of breast cancer than the least active, which echoed findings in other studies. The results were unaffected by factors such as a womanâs weight or whether she used hormone replacement therapy. Dr Alpa Patel, senior epidemiologist at the American Cancer Society in Atlanta, Georgia, said: âOur results clearly support an association between physical activity and postmenopausal breast cancer, with more vigorous activity having a stronger effect. âOur findings are particularly relevant, as people struggle with conflicting information about how much activity they need to stay healthy. âWithout any other recreational physical activities, walking on average of at least one hour per day was associated with a modestly lower risk of breast cancer. âMore strenuous and longer activities lowered the risk even more.â Dr Patel said the majority of women reported some daily walking and therefore promoting walking could be an effective strategy for increasing activity. âWe were pleased to find that without any other recreational activity, just walking an average of one hour per day was associated with lower risk of breast cancer in these women.â The authors said this was the first study to report a lower risk for breast cancer among postmenopausal women specifically related to walking. Baroness Delyth Morgan, chief executive of Breast Cancer Campaign, said: âThis study adds further evidence that our lifestyle choices can play a part in influencing the risk of breast cancer and even small changes incorporated into our normal day to day activity can make a difference. âWe know that the best weapon to overcoming breast cancer is the ability to stop it occurring in the first place. âThe challenge now is how we turn these findings into action and identify other sustainable lifestyle changes that will help us prevent breast cancer.â Public Health England should conduct an audit of existing lifestyle information on preventing the disease, she added. There are an estimated 570,000 people living with breast cancer in the UK. Around 50,000 women and 400 men are diagnosed with breast cancer each year and around 12,000 women and 80 men die from it. Dr Hannah Bridges, senior information officer at Breakthrough Breast Cancer, said: âWeâve known for some time that being active can reduce a womanâs risk of breast cancer. âBreakthrough Breast Cancer advises that 30 minutes of moderate physical activity a day (or 3.5 hours a week) can reduce breast cancer risk by at least 20%. âAny activity that raises your pulse reduces your risk â so regular brisk walks are an easy and free way to get active.â PA Comments are closed for this article.
Candela completes Bolton switch Candela completes Bolton switch Bolton boss Sam Allardyce has signed Roma defender Vincent Candela on a five-month deal. The 31-year-old former France international gave his last press conference as a Roma player on Monday, anouncing his move to Bolton. "I have signed a five-month contract with Bolton," said Candela, who will travel to England on Tuesday. "In June I will decide whether to continue to play for Bolton or retire from professional football." Allardyce hopes Candela's arrival will relieve Bolton's injury crisis after defender Nicky Hunt limped out injured during Oldham's 1-0 win against Oldham in the FA Cup on Sunday. "In light of what has happened to Nicky Hunt, with his injury, it might be a blessing in disguise that we can bring in a highly-experienced full-back to help with our injuries at the back," Allardyce said. "He has an outstanding pedigree in the game and has won honours at the highest level including the World Cup in 1998. "He has not played regular football this year but is eager to impress in the Premiership. "He can play in any position at the back and despite him being predominately right-footed he has played the majority of his career at left-back." Candela, who was a member of the Roma side that won the title in 2001, has made only seven league appearances this season for Luigi del Neri's side. Comments are closed for this article.
Cech sets clean-sheet benchmark Cech sets clean-sheet benchmark Chelsea's Petr Cech set a Premiership goalkeeping benchmark with the aid of a penalty save at Blackburn. Cech's save of Paul Dickov's spot-kick in Chelsea's 1-0 win means the 22-year-old has now gone 781 minutes without conceding a Premiershp goal. That surpasses the previous mark of 694 minutes, set by Manchester United's Peter Schmeichel in 1997. The Czech Republic international said: "The team has been fantastic and I wanted to do my bit to help them win." Cech joined Chelsea last summer for Â£7m from French club Rennes, and on first arriving at Stamford Bridge, was thought to be an understudy to the established Carlo Cudicini. But Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho had confidence to name the Czech international as his starting goalkeeper and Cech began as he intended to continue with a clean sheet in the Blues' opening day win over Manchester United. Cech has kept a clean-sheet in 19 of Chelsea's 25 Premiership games, and only Bolton and Arsenal have managed to put more than one goal past him in a match. The last player to score past Cech in the Premiership was Arsenal's Thierry Henry in the 2-2 draw on 12 December. Return to results
Celtic unhappy over Bulgaria date Celtic unhappy over Bulgaria date Martin O'Neill hopes to block Stilian Petrov's call-up by Bulgaria during Celtic's busy festive programme. The Celtic manager does not view the friendly against Valenciana - a region of Spain - on 28 December as important. "I can't say I was overly pleased at the fixture being played just after Christmas," said O'Neill. "We will have to speak with the Bulgarian FA. It's their prerogative for them to arrange a fixture and our prerogative how we handle it." Bulgaria's game comes between Celtic's Boxing Day meeting with Hearts and their 2 January fixture against Livingston. O'Neill believes the extra game will not help a midfielder whose season has already been affected by injury. "They have organised a game at a rather awkward time," he added. "When we were out playing Barcelona, I spoke with the Bulgarian manager, Hristo Stoichkov, and he mentioned this game to me. "We pay his wages, we are the ones that if an awkward fixture is going to be played at some stage or another it should be to our benefit, rather than anyone else. "I have said this before, but Bulgaria are the one nation who seem to organise a lot of friendly games." Comments are closed for this article.
Chancellor says criticism of German current-account surplus not justified Chancellor says criticism of German current-account surplus not justified German chancellor Angela Merkel: âThe current-account surpluses are a sign of the competitiveness of the German economy and global demand for quality products from Germany.â Photo/Yves Herman German chancellor Angela Merkelâs government has hit back at a US treasury department report that criticised Germany for running an extended trade surplus. The issue is a key one in the debate over the EUâs response to its economic crisis and whether Germany should do more to help countries such as Ireland and Spain. The US report targeted Germany for maintaining a current-account surplus throughout the four-year-old European debt crisis and said policymakers hadnât done enough to bolster domestic demand, delaying a resolution to the crisis. âThe criticism is not justified,â the German economy ministry said. âThe current-account surpluses are a sign of the competitiveness of the German economy and global demand for quality products from Germany.â Diplomatic fallout The spat over economic policy coincides with the diplomatic fallout over US spying on allies and the possible tapping of Dr Merkelâs mobile phone. The chancellor dispatched a team of officials to the White House to begin repairing political damage following the spy disclosures. In the economic sphere, German officials have repeatedly fended off accusations that the countryâs export-led economic growth has been generated at the expense of domestic consumption that would alleviate imbalances in the euro area. Rebound While the US acknowledged a rebound in domestic demand in Europeâs largest economy, German growth âcontinues to rely on positive net exports, which continues to delay the euro areaâs external adjustment processâ. The toll is being taken by indebted euro countries such as Ireland and Greece, which have come under âsevere pressure to curb demand and compress imports in order to promote adjustment,â according to the US report. âThe net result has been a deflationary bias for the euro area, as well as for the world economy,â the Treasury said. Dr Merkel has said that her government has done enough to spur consumption, while championing Germanyâs export-heavy policy as a model for others to follow. â (Online News) Comments are closed for this article.
Coalitionâs choice of way forward broadly applauded but warning given as to risks Coalitionâs choice of way forward broadly applauded but warning given as to risks The path of a lighter budget and rejection of a credit line needs growth for it to work Prof John McHale: The most likely growth number for 2014 is 2 per cent but, because the risks are tilted to the downside, the actual expected growth is actually something less than that. The fragility of the Governmentâs position as it exits the bailout without a special credit line is laid bare in a new report from the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council , the body set up in 2011 to monitor economic policy. At issue primarily are two big plays by the Coalition. First was the manoeuvre in Budget 2014 to opt for a â¬2.5 billion retrenchment instead of the mooted â¬3.1 billion. Second was the decision not to seek precautionary credit. These were political moves essentially,which serve to make life easier in the short term for Fine Gael and Labour . But they are not without risk. While the councilâs reservations about both actions were made clear at the time, it has fleshed them out in detail in a 128-page Fiscal Assessment Report. This examines from an independent standpoint whether the Government policy passes the credibility test. As the troika leaves Dublin, the objective remains that such reports will become established as an important national barometer. Core fiscal strategy The councilâs message is straightforward. It has no real complaint with the Governmentâs core fiscal strategy. But it differs appreciably on the fine-tuning â and the fine-tuning is crucial. In spite of the progress made, the Coalition is cutting it rather thin. For all the positive rhetoric from Taoiseach Enda Kenny and TÃ¡naiste Eamon Gilmore , something akin to a economic limbo dance is afoot. Fine if everything goes their way. But any little tip off-balance would spell danger. There is no safety margin at all in Budget 2014 to allow for any shortfall in economic growth. This raises the prospect of increased retrenchment in 2015 if the all-important 3 per cent deficit target is to be met that year. Amid signs that growth elsewhere in the euro zone is faltering, the potential to create significant political difficulty is clear. âThe most likely growth number for 2014 is 2 per cent but, because the risks are tilted to the downside, the actual expected growth is actually something less than that,â said council chairman Prof John McHale. âSo if the Government is serious about meeting that 3 per cent target, itâs certainly possible that additional adjustment beyond the â¬2 billion already forecast for Budget 2015 could be required.â A further â¬690 million would be needed if nominal economic growth fell back to 1.5 per cent in 2014 instead of the forecast 2 per cent. This would bring the 2015 retrenchment close to â¬2.7 billion, far greater than in the 2014 budget. Worse still would be the â¬3.29 billion needed if growth was projected to fall back again in 2015 . Near the end of a prolonged austerity drive, any such move would reverse the current trend. If that is unpleasant enough on its own terms, doubly unappealing for the Government is that it would come in a pre-election year. Latest Economy Return to results
Commodore finds new lease of life Commodore finds new lease of life The once-famous Commodore computer brand could be resurrected after being bought by a US-based digital music distributor. New owner Yeahronimo Media Ventures has not ruled out the possibility of a new breed of Commodore computers. It also plans to develop a "worldwide entertainment concept" with the brand, although details are not yet known. The groundbreaking Commodore 64 computer elicits fond memories for those who owned one back in the 1980s. In the chronology of home computing, Commodore was one of the pioneers. The Commodore 64, launched in 1982, was one of the first affordable home PCs. It was followed a few years later by the Amiga. The Commodore 64 sold more than any other single computer system, even to this day. The brand languished somewhat in the 1990s. Commodore International filed for bankruptcy in 1994 and was sold to Dutch firm Tulip Computers. In the late 1980s the firm was a great rival to Atari, which produced its own range of home computers and is now a brand of video games, formerly known as Infogrames. Tulip Computers sold several products under the Commodore name, including portable USB storage devices and digital music players. It had planned to relaunch the brand, following an upsurge of nostalgia for 1980s-era games. Commodore 64 enthusiasts have written emulators for Windows PC, Apple Mac and even PDAs so that the original Commodore games can be still run. The sale of Commodore is expected to be complete in three weeks in a deal worth over Â£17m. Return to results
Decline in number of troubled companies is steady rather than accelerating Decline in number of troubled companies is steady rather than accelerating Kavanaghfennell partner David Van Dessel at the Advising Distressed Clients conference at Convention Centre Dublin yesterday. Photograph: Cyril Byrne The number of companies going to the wall fell by almost one-fifth to 1,141 in the first 10 months of the year, figures released yesterday show. According to the Insolvency Journal, published by corporate restructuring specialist Kavanagh Fennell, a total of 1,141 companies were wound up or placed in examinership or receivership between January and the end of October. The figure was 19 per cent lower than the same period in 2012, when the total was 1,408. The decline in insolvencies was slower in the month of October itself, when 116 companies ran into trouble, which was 8 per cent less than the same month in 2012. Rate of decline Kavanagh Fennell partner David van Dessel noted yesterday the overall drop in insolvencies this year has been in the region of 20 per cent, but he said that the rate of decline has not picked up. âThis is a little surprising as one would have expected the slowdown in corporate insolvency to increase in pace during 2013, which it hasnât. It has remained relatively constant, albeit at a lower rate of incidence,â he said. The number of liquidations, the most common insolvency process, fell 21 per cent to 838, the biggest drop. Creditors appointed receivers to 285 companies in the first 10 months of the year, 13 per cent fewer than during the same period in 2012. Latest Economy Return to results
Digital guru floats sub-$100 PC Digital guru floats sub-$100 PC Nicholas Negroponte, chairman and founder of MIT's Media Labs, says he is developing a laptop PC that will go on sale for less than $100 (Â£53). He told the Online News World Service programme Go Digital he hoped it would become an education tool in developing countries. He said one laptop per child could be " very important to the development of not just that child but now the whole family, village and neighbourhood". He said the child could use the laptop like a text book. He described the device as a stripped down laptop, which would run a Linux-based operating system, "We have to get the display down to below $20, to do this we need to rear project the image rather than using an ordinary flat panel. "The second trick is to get rid of the fat , if you can skinny it down you can gain speed and the ability to use smaller processors and slower memory." The device will probably be exported as a kit of parts to be assembled locally to keep costs down. Mr Negroponte said this was a not for profit venture, though he recognised that the manufacturers of the components would be making money. In 1995 Mr Negroponte published the bestselling Being Digital, now widely seen as predicting the digital age. The concept is based on experiments in the US state of Maine, where children were given laptop computers to take home and do their work on. While the idea was popular amongst the children, it initially received some resistance from the teachers and there were problems with laptops getting broken. However, Mr Negroponte has adapted the idea to his own work in Cambodia where he set up two schools together with his wife and gave the children laptops. "We put in 25 laptops three years ago , only one has been broken, the kids cherish these things, it's also a TV a telephone and a games machine, not just a textbook." Mr Negroponte wants the laptops to become more common than mobile phones but conceded this was ambitious. "Nokia make 200 million cell phones a year, so for us to claim we're going to make 200 million laptops is a big number, but we're not talking about doing it in three or five years, we're talking about months." He plans to be distributing them by the end of 2006 and is already in discussion with the Chinese education ministry who are expected to make a large order. "In China they spend $17 per child per year on textbooks. That's for five or six years, so if we can distribute and sell laptops in quantities of one million or more to ministries of education that's cheaper and the marketing overheads go away."

Dijsselbloem cancels IMF trip due to Dutch budget talks Dijsselbloem cancels IMF trip due to Dutch budget talks Dutch finance minister due to represent euro zone at annual meeting in Washington Dutch finance minister and Eurogroup chairman Jeroen Dijsselbloem was due to attend IMF talks in Washington today. Photograph: Francois Lenoir/Online News Dutch finance minister and Eurogroup head Jeroen Dijsselbloem has cancelled a trip to the annual IMF meetings to deal with urgent domestic budget negotiations, Dutch media reported today. Mr Dijsselbloem had been due to represent the euro zone countries during the annual meetings in Washington starting today, national broadcaster NOS reported. Mr Dijsselbloem took the last-minute decision in an effort to salvage a budget deal with minority parties needed to support an additional â¬6 billion in austerity measures next year, it said. The Dutch government needs the cuts to meet the European Unionâs 3 per cent budget deficit target in 2014, but does not have enough backing in the Senate without small opposition parties. Dutch Central Bank president Klaas Knot said this week the governmentâs failure to reach an agreement on the budget was the most significant threat to Dutch economic recovery. The Netherlands is the only core eurozone country still in a recession and is suffering from a property crisis, rising unemployment and sluggish consumer spending. Failure to reach a budget deal could prompt elections and hurt chances of an economic recovery. Online News .

Disadvantaged children remain at higher risk of exposure to second-hand smoke Disadvantaged children remain at higher risk of exposure to second-hand smoke Pictured launching the report are (from left to right) Dr Helen McAvoy of the IPH; Northern Ireland health minister Edwin Poots; Minister for Health Dr James Reilly and Prof Luke Clancy of the TobaccoFree Research Institute Ireland. Disadvantaged children remain at risk of second-hand smoke The number of children taking up smoking and women who smoke during pregnancy has declined over the past decade, a new report has found. However while tobacco control measures are proving successful, disadvantaged children remain at particular risk of exposure to second-hand smoke. The findings are contained within A Tobacco-Free Future, an all-island report on tobacco, inequalities and childhood published today by the Institute of Public Health in Ireland (IPH) and the TobaccoFree Research Institute Ireland. The World Health Organisation considers that there are three key âwindows of exposureâ in terms of tobacco-related harm in childhood â in the womb, directly through children taking up smoking and through exposure to second hand smoke in indoor and outdoor environments. The Tobacco-Free report presents findings on these three windows of exposure based on a range of data sources in the Republic and in Northern Ireland . It found smoking rates during pregnancy fell by around a third in the Republic of Ireland between 1997/1998 and 2007/2008. However levels of smoking in pregnancy remain significant with around 17 -18 per cent of all pregnant women smoking in 2007 and 2008 according to data from the Coombe Women and Infants University Hospital in Dublin. Smoking in pregnancy is associated with low birthweight and premature births. The proportion of children aged 10-17 reporting that they had ever smoked fell from 36 per cent to 27 per cent between 2006 and 2010 in the Republic and from 24 per cent to 19 per cent among 11-16 year olds in Northern Ireland. Children are still trying their first cigarette at a very young age but there are some signs of improvement Between 2002 and 2010 there was a significant decline in the proportion of young people in the Republic who reported having their first cigarette aged 13 or younger from 60.6 per cent to 48.9 per cent. However many children remain exposed to second hand smoke. The report found that 22 per cent of nine year olds live in a home where people smoke in the same room as them. Disadvantaged children are more likely to live in households with smoking adults and are at greater risk of exposure to second-hand smoke. According to the report nine-year-old children in the Republic living in the lowest income families are twice as likely to be exposed to smoking than children in the highest income families. Having a mother who smoked was associated with an increased risk of respiratory illnesses and ear infections in the first nine months of life. Dr Helen McAvoy of the IPH said many trends identified in the report were encouraging. âThe reportâs findings demonstrate the return from the introduction of broad-ranging tobacco control measures such as smoke-free workplaces, regulation of vending machines and pack sizes, price increases and removal of point of sale displays in retail outlets,â she said. âHowever, the burden of harm associated with smoking falls heavily on the most disadvantaged children. She said children were uniquely susceptible to tobacco marketing and branding. The report highlights the importance of continuing efforts to restrict access and appeal of tobacco products to young people and stresses the importance of stop smoking initiatives within maternity, child and family policies and services, particularly in disadvantaged areas. It draws on a range of data sources in the Republic and from Northern Ireland including Growing Up in Ireland, the national longitudinal study of children; research from the Coombe; and analysis of the Health Behaviour in School-aged Child Survey (HSBC). The publication was welcomed by the Minister for Health James Reilly and his counterpart in the North Edwin Poots. Return to results
Domain system opens door to scams Domain system opens door to scams A system to make it easier to create website addresses using alphabets like Cyrillic could open a back door for scammers, a trade body has warned. The Internationalised Domain Names system has been a work in progress for years and has recently been approved by the Internet Engineering Task Force. But the UK Internet Forum (UKIF) is concerned that the system will let scammers create fake sites more easily. The problem lies in the computer codes used to represent language. Registering names that look like that of legitimate companies but lead users to fake sites designed to steal passwords and credit card details could become a whole lot easier for determined scammers, says Stephen Dyer, director of UKIF. Domain names are the "real language" addresses of websites, rather than their internet protocol address, which is a series of numbers. They are used so people can more easily navigate the web. So-called ASCII codes are used to represent European languages but for other languages a hybrid of a system called Unicode is used. So, for example, website PayPal could now be coded using a mixture of the Latin alphabet and the Russian alphabet. The resulting domain as displayed to the users would look identical to the real site as a Russian 'a' look just like an English 'a'. But the computer code would be different, and the site it would lead users to could be a fake. This is more than just a theory. A fake Paypal.com has already been registered with net domain giant Verisign by someone who has followed the debate around the Internationalised Domain Name (IDN) system, said Mr Dyer. As the idea was to prove a point rather than be malicious the fake domain has now been handed back to Paypal but it sets a worrying precedent, Mr Dyer said. "Although the IDN problem is well known in technical circles, the commercial world is totally unaware how easily their websites can be faked," said Mr Dyer. "It is important to alert users that there is a new and invisible and almost undetectable way of diverting them to what looks like a perfectly genuine site," he added. There are solutions. For instance, browsers could spot domains that use mixed characters and display them in different colours as a warning to users. Mr Dyer acknowledged that it would be a huge undertaking to update all the world's browsers. Another solution, to introduce IDN-disabled browsers could be a case of "throwing out the baby with the bath water," he said. CENTR, the Council of European National Top Level Domain Registries, agrees. "A rush to introduce IDN-disabled browsers into the marketplace is an overly-zealous step that will harm public confidence in IDNs - a technology that is desperately needed in the non-English speaking world," the organisation said in a statement.

EU law is clear that public health must outweigh financial considerations EU law is clear that public health must outweigh financial considerations âThe decision of certain public authorities to promote off-label medicines raises the question as to what would happen if the use of such drugs gave rise to patient safety concerns. Given the negative consequences for private companies which promote off-label medicines, it would be interesting to see whether these public authorities would face similar liability.â Cormac Little Concerns raised during the recent inquest into the tragic death of Bimbo Onanuga have again highlighted the potential difficulties arising from the use of off-label medicines. Earlier this month, the Dublin Coronerâs Court heard that Ms Onanuga was given an ulcer medication, misoprostol, to induce labour. In returning a verdict of medical misadventure, the coroner stated that the main risk factors were the deceasedâs pre-existing scar and the off-label use of misoprostol. The coroner signalled his intention to raise the concerns of Ms Onanugaâs family regarding the use of this off-label drug with the Irish Medicines Board . Looking at the broader picture, the use of medicines for purposes for which they are not authorised gives rise to fundamental issues of patient safety. For obvious reasons, prescription drugs are among the worldâs most tightly regulated products. They are licensed for specific health issues after lengthy and robust clinical trials. Off-label use occurs where a doctor prescribes an approved medicine for the treatment of a particular illness or for doses for which it is not licensed or authorised. Proper practice dictates that only where there is no available licensed alternative should off-label prescriptions be allowed. In addition, any therapeutic decision should be made with the patientâs consent. If a licensed alternative is available, the patient should be told so that he or she can make an informed decision. However sometimes where a doctor has a choice between an unlicensed medicine and a licensed alternative, he or she may opt for the former, particularly if it is less expensive. That said, off-label use for budgetary reasons is not consistent with the jurisprudence of the European courts, which have consistently held that the protection of public health takes precedence over financial considerations. Notwithstanding this, recent years have seen a change in attitude by certain EU member states. Just under a year ago, France adopted a law authorising the government to issue recommendations encouraging off-label use of a drug despite the existence of authorised alternatives, with a view to reducing its expenditure on social security. Previously, off-label use was only permitted in the absence of any authorised therapeutic alternative and provided that the patient was informed. Moreover, certain Finnish and UK authorities promoted the unauthorised use of Avastin to treat age-related macular degeneration or AMD on cost grounds because Lucentis, the authorised medicine to treat AMD, was more expensive. This shift in policy contrasts with the consequences faced by pharmaceutical manufacturers which are suspected or found to have wrongly promoted a drug for off-label use. These include investigations, litigation and heavy fines, not to mention the associated controversy and negative publicity. To take a recent example, a US court fined American biotechnology giant Amgen $762 million in December 2012 after it pleaded guilty to promoting the off-label use of Aranesp. As a result of cases such as this, manufacturers are best advised to take great care not to promote off-label use inappropriately. Since the health concerns that arose during the BSE in British beef controversy, EU law has been clear that public health must outweigh financial considerations. In March 2012, as a result of enforcement proceedings brought by the European Commission , the European Court of Justice found that a Polish law permitting the sale of unauthorised medicines on cost grounds was illegal under EU law. The court noted that exceptions to the rule that all prescribed medicines must be authorised should be read very narrowly. Doctorsâ rights to prescribe off-label only arise following âan actual examination of his patients and on the basis of purely therapeutic considerationsâ, ie not for financial reasons. The court also noted that where an equivalent authorised medicine was available, there existed no special need for an unauthorised product. The decision of certain public authorities to promote off-label medicines raises the question as to what would happen if the use of such drugs gave rise to patient safety concerns. Given the negative consequences for private companies which promote off-label medicines, it would be interesting to see whether these public authorities would face similar liability. Given the overall economic backdrop, the pressure on public finances across Europe is unlikely to ease any time soon. Therefore, healthcare budgets will continue to come under scrutiny. That said, EU law prevents patient safety being undermined for financial reasons. If national authorities continue to promote off-label use for budgetary reasons, we may again see the European Commission having to step in. This is only a fair outcome: since the private sector is rightly held to high standards of conduct when it comes to promoting off-label use; the public sector must be too.

Everybody with a serious mental illness, such as schizophrenia or manic depressive illness, should h... Everybody with a serious mental illness, such as schizophrenia or manic depressive illness, should have an annual health screen with an emphasis on risk factors for heart disease, according to Prof Jogin Thakore, associate professor of psychiatry at Trinity College Dublin . While advice on smoking cessation, diet and exercise has led to dramatic falls in the rates of death due to heart disease in the general population, Prof Thakore points out the rates of death due to heart disease in those with mental illness has remained the same over the past 20 years. On average, patients with schizophrenia live up to 25 years less than expected, while those with manic depressive illness or bipolar disorder live an average 12-13 years less. Apart from suicide, the most common causes of death in patients with mental illness are natural ones, including heart disease. According to Prof Thakore, this group have a large number of the risk factors for heart disease such as smoking, poor diet, lack of exercise and higher rates of Type 2 diabetes. âUp to 95 per cent of people with schizophrenia smoke and usually have started before they go on medication. They donât take enough exercise or eat the right foods and interestingly, neither do their siblings. Maybe itâs not all down to the medication.â Prof Thakore is speaking about the physical effects of mental illness at the RCSI MiniMed open lecture series tomorrow evening, at the RCSI, St Stephenâs Green.

Faye plans to stay at Portsmouth Faye plans to stay at Portsmouth Portsmouth midfielder Amdy Faye is keen to stay at Fratton Park and help keep the club in the Premiership. The Senegalese international has been linked with moves to Middlesbrough, Aston Villa and Bolton after hinting at his desire to play European football. But Faye told the Portsmouth Evening News: "Every week there's a new club I'm linked with - but I'm staying here. "I'm getting tired of hearing all this talk and I'm clear in my mind now that I'm staying at Portsmouth." Faye could well stay after fellow midfielder Nigel Quashie completed his move to re-join former Pompey boss Harry Redknapp at rivals Southampton on Monday. And Redknapp may continue to plunder Portsmouth's midfield, with claims from Fratton Park chairman Milan Mandaric that two top flight clubs are interested in Patrik Berger. Although Mandaric has refused to name the clubs, Southampton are thought to be involved. Return to results
Featured: 'Friends fear' with lost mobiles 'Friends fear' with lost mobiles People are becoming so dependent on their mobile phones that one in three are concerned that losing their phone would mean they lose their friends. More than 50% of mobile owners reported they had had their phone stolen or lost in the last three years. More than half (54%) of those asked in a poll for mobile firm Intervoice said that they do not have another address book. A fifth rely entirely on mobiles. About 80% of UK adults own at least one mobile, according to official figures. It is estimated that 53% of over 65s own a mobile, according to Intervoice, but the figures are higher for those aged between 15 and 34. Most 15 to 24-year-olds (94%), and 25 to 34-year-olds (92%), own at least one. Nineteen percent of mobile owners were more concerned about how long it would take to find their contacts' information again if the phone was lost, stolen or replaced. The survey showed that extent to which people have become reliant on their phones as address book. Many mobile owners do not bother to make back-ups of their contact details, and with people changing their phones once a year on average, it becomes a problem. They also are becoming less likely to remember numbers by heart, relying on the mobile phone book instead. "We're a nation of lazy so-and-sos," David Noone from Intervoice said. "We put the numbers in our phones so we can call a friend at the touch of just one or two buttons and we certainly can't be bothered to write them down in an old fashioned address book. "The mobile phone plays such a key role in modern relationships; take the phone away and the way we manage these relationships falls apart." One in three women, the survey said, thought if they lost their phones, it would mean they would lose touch with people altogether. Most (62%) said they had no idea what their partner's number was. Mr Noone said it should be up to mobile operators to provide back-up services on the network itself, instead of relying on mobile owners to find ways themselves. Generally, information from Sim cards can be backed up on physical memory cards, or can be copied onto computers via cables if the phone is a smartphone model with the right software. Sim back-up devices can be bought from phone shops for just a few pounds. But some operators offer customers free web-based back-up services too. Orange told the Online News News website that those with Orange Smartphones could use the My Phone syncing service which means back-ups of address books and other data are created online. For non-smartphone users, a Memory Mate card could be used to back up data on the phone. O2 also offers a free, web-based syncing service which works over GPRS and GSM. Neither Vodafone or T-Mobile currently offer a free network service for back-ups, but encourage people to use Sim back-up devices. It is thought that about 10,000 phones are lost or stolen every month and 50% of total street crime involves a mobile. Mobile phone sales are expected to continue growing over the next year. Globally, more than 167 million mobile phones were sold in the third quarter of 2004, 26% more than the previous year, according to analysts. It is predicted that there will be two billion handsets in use worldwide by the end of 2005. Comments are closed for this article.
Featured: 'Ultimate game' award for Doom 3 'Ultimate game' award for Doom 3 Sci-fi shooter Doom 3 has blasted away the competition at a major games ceremony, the Golden Joystick awards. It was the only title to win twice, winning Ultimate Game of the year and best PC game at the awards, presented by Little Britain star Matt Lucas. The much-anticipated sci-fi horror Doom 3 shot straight to the top of the UK games charts on its release in August. Other winners included Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas which took the Most Wanted for Christmas prize. Only released last week, it was closely followed by Halo 2 and Half-Life 2, which are expected to be big hits when they are unleashed later this month. But they missed out on the prize for the Most Wanted game of 2005, which went to the Nintendo title, The Legend of Zelda. The original Doom, released in 1994, heralded a new era in computer games and introduced 3D graphics. It helped to establish the concept of the first-person shooter. Doom 3 was developed over four years and is thought to have cost around $15m (Â£8.3m). The top honour for the best online game of the year went to Battlefield Vietnam. The Chronicles of Riddick: Escape from Butcher Bay was handed the Unsung Hero Game of 2004. Its release was somewhat eclipsed by Doom 3, which was released on the same week. It was, however, very well received by gamers and was praised for its storyline which differed from the film released around the same time. Electronic Arts was named top publisher of the year, taking the crown from Nintendo which won in 2003. The annual awards are voted for by more than 200,000 readers of computer and video games magazines. Games awards like this have grown in importance. Over the last six years, the UK market for games grew by 100% and was worth a record Â£1,152m in 2003, according to a recent report by analysts Screen Digest. Comments are closed for this article.
Figures may strengthen Athensâ hand in protracted bailout negotiations Figures may strengthen Athensâ hand in protracted bailout negotiations Greece said tax revenues exceeded expectations in October. Photograph: Yiorgos Karahalis/Online News Greek tax revenues exceeded expectations in October, helping the country stay on track to meet its 2013 fiscal target, the government said today. In what may strengthen Athensâ hand in protracted bailout negotiations with its international lenders, the central government posted a primary budget surplus - before interest payments and one-off revenues - of â¬1.1 billion. Deputy finance minister Christos Staikouras told reporters tax revenue in the period was â¬250 million ahead of target, showing that households and business are coping with record unemployment and a wave of corporate bankruptcies in the sixth year of an austerity-fuelled recession. This means that Athens was on course to hit its 2013 fiscal targets and fulfill conditions to seek additional debt relief from its international lenders, Staikouras said. âAt a huge sacrifice to Greek citizens, unprecedented in post-war Europe , it seems that the country is succeeding its goal,â Mr Staikouras said. A â¬345 million primary surplus target at general government level, which also includes the budgets of social security administrations and local government, was âfeasibleâ, Mr Staikouras said. Greece has a long history of questionable reporting of data, but it is now under close scrutiny from its lenders, the so-called troika of the International Monetary Fund , European Commission and European Central Bank . Todayâs reading may help Athens in negotiations with the troika, which questions its promise that it will hit its 2014 targets without resort to new, unpopular savings. âThe country strengthens its negotiating position,â Mr Staikouras said. Under the terms of its bailout, Greeceâs primary budget must be balanced this year and have a surplus of â¬2.751 billion, or 1.5 per cent of GDP, in 2014. But lenders believe that Athens will miss the 2014 target by about 2 billion euros, due to social spending overruns and possible tax revenue shortfalls. Athens disagrees, saying that expected economic recovery and better tax collection will help it hit its targets. The government has also been spending far less on public investment than it initially planned to fix its finances this year. Greece is due to receive up to â¬5.9 billion of EU/IMF lifeline loans by the end of the year, according to a current disbursement schedule. The two sides are not in a hurry to conclude a deal since the country has no pressing funding needs. (Online News) Return to results
Fiscal Council still wants â¬3.1 billion budget adjustment Fiscal Council still wants â¬3.1 billion budget adjustment Statement follows comments by Labour TD saying council is okay with â¬2.5 billion Labour Party TD Arthur Spring said last night that the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council âare now okâ with a lower budget adjustment of â¬2.5 billion. The Irish Fiscal Advisory Council said it maintains the view that the fiscal adjustment in next weekâs budget should be â¬3.1 billion. The statement comes following an appearance by Labour Party TD Arthur Spring on RTÃâs Prime Time programme last night, where he said the council âare now okâ with a lower budget adjustment of â¬2.5 billion. The advisory body said today it was required under the Fiscal Responsibility Act to endorse the macroeconomic forecasts underlying the budget, but was ânot required to endorse budgetary projectionsâ. âThey know that budgetary wise, the fact that we are creating jobs again and started to increase growth in the economy, we are in a better position than we thought we would be,â Mr Spring said. The advisory body said it still endorsed the forecasts for this year and next prepared by Government last month, which had outlined the need for an adjustment of â¬3.1 billion for 2014. Minister for Finance Michael Noonan said yesterday that spending cuts and tax increases in the forthcoming budget would amount to â¬2.5 billion, â¬600 million less than the original target, because the Government could find âother savings in the systemâ. Todayâs statement from the council noted the Governmentâs intention to implement a smaller adjustment, but said âthe macroeconomic forecasts remain within the endorsable rangeâ. âThe Council would like to stress that its assessment of the appropriate fiscal stance is unchanged. It has previously publicly stated that the preferred policy is to continue with the previously planned aggregate adjustment of â¬3.1bn in Budget 2014,â it said. The Department of Finance said yesterday that it expects the economy to grow by 1.8 per cent next year. A report by the Economic and Social Research Institute published today warned that a reduced target could trigger another round of austerity measures in next yearâs budget if the Governmentâs growth forecasts fail to materialise.

Games firms 'face tough future' Games firms 'face tough future' UK video game firms face a testing time as they prepare for the next round of games consoles, the industry warns. Fred Hasson, head of Tiga, which represents independent developers, said that more UK firms would go under due to greater risks in making new titles. Three leading UK video game companies also predicted that more firms would close as they struggled to adapt. Microsoft, Sony and Nintendo are expected to release new consoles in the next 18 months. Microsoft has said repeatedly that it wants to be first to the market and some analysts predict that Xbox 2 will be released in the US before the end of 2005. The new machines will all have much greater processing and graphical power which will have a huge impact on development of next generation games. Mr Hasson said: "In the last four years we have probably lost a third of independent developers." He said there were about 150 independent developers left in the industry and more were likely to close. "Once the cull has finished its likely to present those still standing with great opportunities," he said. Mr Hasson said the industry was predicting that developments costs and teams were likely to need to double in order to cope with the demands of the new machines. That figure was endorsed by three independent companies contacted by the Online News News website - Codemasters, Climax and Rebellion. "As consoles get more powerful, the content gets more detailed and that means more cost," said Gary Dunn, development director at Codemasters, which develops games in house and also publishes titles. Jason Kingsley, chief executive of Rebellion, said the transition from the current generation of consoles to the new machines was difficult because "the production quality expected by consumers will be that much bigger". He added: "We have been through five technology transitions and survived so far. "Each one has involved the death of some people. All companies said they were investing in new tools - called middleware - in order to try and avoid staff numbers spiralling out of control. Simon Gardner, president of Climax's Action studio, said: "We are investing in superior tools and editors. We are investing upfront to generate this content without the need for huge teams. "It's vital we avoid huge teams." He said Climax was already directing about 20% of its resources to preparation for next generation titles. Mr Dunn warned that companies could face a short supply of programming, development and artistic talent. "If companies are hiring bigger and bigger teams, at some point the talent is going to run out." Mr Hasson said games developers were beginning to realise that they had to be more "business-like". "There are still some developers who were involved in games from the bedroom coding days. "Some of them are still making games for peer group approval - that has to stop."

Giggs handed Wales leading role Giggs handed Wales leading role Ryan Giggs will captain Wales as he wins his 50th cap in Wednesday's friendly against Hungary in Cardiff. John Toshack, in his first game as coach after succeeding Mark Hughes, admits he is surprised that Giggs has only just reached the landmark. "With the games he's played for United, proportionately it doesn't seem that many for Wales," Toshack said. "But he's one of the greatest of all Welsh internationals and on his 50th cap it's appropriate he's captain." Giggs admits he had briefly considered retirement from the international game, but is now targetting playing for Wales in the 2008 European Championships. The Manchester United wing revealed how club manager Sir Alex Ferguson talked him into extending his Wales career. "I briefly discussed my international future with Sir Alex, but he urged me to carry on," Giggs said. "He feels, like myself, that I have no weight problems and keep myself fit, so in three or four years' time I will be able to play in the European finals if we get there. "The manager has always wanted me to play for my club and country and he was keen for me to continue because I am fit enough." Giggs admits he was wavering and considering joining the likes of former Wales skipper Gary Speed and United team-mate Paul Scholes in committing the remaining years of his career to club football. But Giggs is now focussed on making the Toshack era even more successful than the time Hughes spent at the helm. The Manchester United winger won his first cap as a 17-year-old in 1991, an away loss to Germany, and now faces his landmark appearance at the age of 31. With Giggs leading Wales out against Hungary, there is every chance that he will become the permanent successor to Speed. However, Toshack refused to reveal whether he sees Giggs as a long-term option. "For this particular game I think it is appropriate that Ryan Giggs will be captain, it's his 50th cap and he's known for some time about that," Toshack said. On Wednesday night Toshack takes charge of his first match since replacing Hughes, and Giggs said: "It's my 50th cap and I am looking forward to it, and I hope to play a lot more times from here on in. "It's important to be here, all the players feel the same. It's a new start and all the top players certainly see it as important. "I see myself leading by example, it is something I have taken on for Wales as well as United these past few seasons. "The way John is looking at things, he is aiming to build his side around the experienced lads right up to the next tournament, the Euro 2006 event. "I have told John I will be around for the next European tournament, by then I will be 35 so hopefully I will still be okay. "A lot can happen, but I'm hoping to be around." Giggs' own personal future at Old Trafford is still up in the air as he has yet to reach agreement on a new contract, with Manchester United offering one extra year and Giggs seeking two. "I have put the contract thing to the back of my mind at the moment," said Giggs. "It is an important period for the club and I am just concentrated on that. "I've heard the suggestions, hopefully there is a two-year deal about to be offered because that is what I am looking for, to get it sorted out. "I'm enjoying my football, the way United have been playing and my own form, you have to enjoy it. "We have massive games coming up: Manchester City this week, then the Everton cup tie, followed by AC Milan in the Champions League, and my first Wales game under John Toshack, so it's an important time."

HIQA inspections find poor hygiene in four hospitals HIQA inspections find poor hygiene in four hospitals Mater Misericordiae in Dublin and Nenagh Hospital judged to be âgenerally uncleanâ The Mater Hospital, Dublin where HIQA inspectors found âmuch evidence of practice that was not compliantâ with national standards. Photograph: Eric Luke/The Online News HIQA reports into hygiene standards in five hospitals published this morning have found evidence of inadequate hand hygiene leading to risk of infection to patients while wards in two hospitals were deemed âgenerally uncleanâ. Unannounced inspections of the Mater, Nenagh, St Vincentâs, Tallaght and Ennis hospitals were carried out by Hiqa inspectors between August and September and focused on environmental cleanliness and hand hygiene. Four of the five hospitals, with Ennis being the only exception, were found to breach hand hygiene standards to the point where the practice posed a risk to patients of healthcare associated infections. Map In the Mater Misericordiae hospital in Dublin HIQA inspectors found âmuch evidence of practice that was not compliantâ with national standards. It found that the two wards inspected - St Teresaâs, which is a medical ward and St Josephâs - were âgenerally uncleanâ although patient equipment was âmostly cleanâ. Inspectors in the Mater reported: - unlabelled syringes containing unknown solutions found in two kidney dishes on a worktop in the utility room in St Teresaâs Ward while unclean intravenous stands were also found in the ward - inappropriate storage of hazardous chemicals in a âdirtyâ utility room which contained multiple wire catheter holders, some of which were rusted. - that hand hygiene practices were not embedded at all levels, especially among staff practices observed on St Josephâs ward - eight patient washbowls and bed urinals stored incorrectly in the St Josephâs ward where some bedpans were also observed to be stained In a statement released this afternoon the Mater said improving hygiene compliance was a âtop priorityâ for the hospital. It said it was disappointed with some findings as outlined in HIQAâs report: âWe would like to take this opportunity to reassure patients that our hospital is clean and that we will continue to work hard to achieve best practice in National Hygiene Standards.â In Nenagh Hospital inspectors found that the environment and equipment in two wards, Medical 1, a male ward and Medical 2 ward, a female ward were âgenerally uncleanâ with a subsequent risk of to patients of hospital-based infections. Inspectors in Nenagh also reported: - an unlocked storage unit in Medical 2 contained needles, syringes and oral medications - that a culture of hand hygiene practice was not embedded among all staff; some sinks designated for hand washing were unclean with a black âmould-like substanceâ on one sink - damaged coverings in Medical 1 hindered effective cleaning while the ward had wall surfaces with large areas of paint missing and a sink located beside an exposed, crumbling wall surface beside a patientâs bed - the surface of a patient temperature monitoring device was unclean and there was a piece of soiled dressing tape on the surface of the device - a sticky residue the surface of an intravenous pump in the nursesâ station; and grit and rust around the area over the wheels of dressing trolleys .

Hodgson relishes European clashes Hodgson relishes European clashes Former Blackburn boss Roy Hodgson says the Premiership should follow the rest of Europe and have a winter break - but insists that a gruelling domestic schedule will not damage the English elite's bid for Champions League glory. Hodgson - now in charge at Viking Stavanger - was at Liverpool's clash with Bayer Leverkusen at Anfield on Tuesday as a member of Uefa's technical committee. Hodgson is a fierce advocate of the winter break employed throughout Europe, although not in England - where the Champions League contenders have ploughed through a heavy fixture list. But Hodgson told Online News Sport that while he believes the Premiership should embrace the idea, he does not expect it to cost the English representatives in the last 16 of the Champions League. "I just feel it is very difficult to say with certainty that teams who have had the break will have a definite edge. "I am a fervent supporter of the break. It gives players the chance to recharge their batteries midway through the season, which some suggest will give teams an advantage in the Champions League. "The other school of thought suggests having a break then coming back to it puts you at a disadvantage. "The bigger discussions around the winter break should be to do with the nature of football today, the needs of football players and the way the Premiership has developed, rather than one or two matches in the Champions League in February." Hodgson believes a winter break carries many advantages, explaining: "As I said, it is the perfect chance to recharge batteries. "And certainly if I was still a manager in England I would be supporting any calls for its introduction. "In pre-season you get a lot of enthusiasm and energy but by the time you get towards Christmas many players, having also played plenty of international matches for club and country and travelled a lot, find themselves getting very jaded. "The break gives them a chance to recover that energy and enthusiasm and, perhaps more importantly, recover their mental strength during the break and get ready for the games ahead. "The mental side is by far the most important thing." Hodgson added: "The length of breaks can vary. In Italy the break was very short. You just took Christmas and New Year. "It was so short you didn't do anything. You gave the players a week or 10 days off, then you were training for a week or 10 days and then went into a game. "If it is longer, it is important those responsible for physical fitness give the players a programme to follow to ensure the physical strength they have accumulated stays with them." And Hodgson believes a winter break would be a positive step in the Premiership. He said: "If we talk about football at elite level, which the Premiership is, then I would support a winter break. "If you examine the demands of the Premier League and, in particular on players who play international football for their club and country, then a break would do them the world of good - physically and mentally."

Hollywood campaign hits websites Hollywood campaign hits websites Movie studio efforts to stop pirated films being shared on peer-to-peer networks have claimed a high-profile victim. The campaign of legal action is thought to be behind the closure of the widely used Suprnova.org website. The site was the most popular place for people swapping and sharing links for the BitTorrent network. A recent study showed that more than half of the peer-to-peer traffic during June was for the BitTorrent system. In a message posted on Suprnova.org on Sunday, the site's controllers said the site was "closing down for good in the way that we all know it". If the site did return, the message said, it would not be hosting any more torrent links. It continued: "We are very sorry for this, but there was no other way, we have tried everything. " The only parts that would keep going, said the operators of the Suprnova site, were the discussion forums and net chat channels. The site is thought to have closed following an announcement by the Motion Picture Association of America that it was launching legal action against those operating BitTorrent servers rather than end users. Because of the way that BitTorrent works, server sites do not host the actual file being shared, instead they host a link that points people to others that have it. By targeting servers, the MPAA hopes to cripple BitTorrent's ability to share files. In the opening days of the MPAA campaign, the organisation filed 100 lawsuits against operators of BitTorrent server site. The launching of the legal seems to be having an effect. Phoenix Torrents, another popular BitTorrent site, has also decided to shut down and, though it gave no reasons for the closure, it is thought to be motivated by the threat of legal action. Last week Finnish police raided a BitTorrent site based in the country that, according to reports, let 10,000 users shared pirated films, software, music and games. Return to results
Honohan addresses conference on lessons to be drawn from financial crash Honohan addresses conference on lessons to be drawn from financial crash Irelandâs banking system had assets worth nine times the countryâs GDP just before the State went into financial meltdown in 2008, according to Central Bank governor Patrick Honohan . However, he said it would be misleading to draw a simple conclusion about the financial collapse from this âheadline factâ. Prof Honohan was addressing a banking conference in Reykjavik, organised by the Central Bank of Iceland. One of the chief similarities between the recent financial blowouts in Ireland , Iceland and Cyprus was that all three countries had big banking sectors relative to the size of their economies. Having an undeveloped banking system - one that is small relative to the size of the economy - initially acts as a restraint on growth, Prof Honohan said. This relationship held true until the bank-to-GDP ratio got to about 100 per cent. However, beyond this point, he said there was little evidence of a âgrowth-enhancing functionâ from having a large banking system. Equally, rapid growth in a banking systemâs credit to the domestic economy had been âlong-known as a risk factor for financial instability.â The ultimate lesson of the crash was that if large banking systems with access to foreign finance became involved in providing credit to the local economy âthey had the capacity to rapidly destabilise itâ. In Irelandâs case, Prof Honohan identified four different types of banks operating in the sector at the time of the crash. Locally controlled banks, servicing the domestic economy, made up about 44 per cent of the system, he said. A further 12 per cent comprised subsidiaries and branches of foreign-controlled banks dealing with the domestic economy. There were also foreign-owned entities involved in exporting services, which accounted for about 19 per cent of the system, and which ultimately failed because of the subprime crisis. Prof Honohan identified a final and fourth category of other foreign-owned concerns, which also used Ireland as an export base, but which remained âsolidâ after the crash. While the first three categories got into trouble and âhad to be rescuedâ, he said only the locally-controlled banks were implicated in the fiscal cost to the Government. âThe wider destabilisation of the Irish economy, including the boom and bust in property prices which has left a large section of the household sector under stress of over-indebtedness, was created by the first two categories of bank (and especially their ability to source foreign funding), but not by the third or fourth category.â Latest Economy Return to results
Inflation remains muted in October, CSO data shows Inflation remains muted in October, CSO data shows Degree of respite for Irish consumers, but Budget-related hikes will hit home Consumer prices rose by 0.1 per cent in the year to October. Photographer: Aidan Crawley/Online News Prices rose by 0.1 per cent in the year to October, the Central Statistics office said today, reflecting falling mortgage rates and energy prices. The rise was attributed to a 5.3 per cent increase in the cost of alcohol and tobacco over the year, with a rise of 4.6 per cent in education due to increased costs for third level education, and 1.8 per cent in the cost of restaurants and hotels, which was attributed to higher costs for alcohol consumed on licensed premises. This was partly offset by a fall in the price of clothing and footwear, which declined by 4.1 per cent due to cut-price sales, and a 2.2 per cent decline in the cost of transport and petrol and diesel prices fell. However, the inflation figures do not take account of the increased excise duty on alcohol and tobacco imposed in the budget last month, meaning further rises are likely to be reflected in next monthâs release. âThe underlying narrative around the CPI remains intact - muted inflationary pressures are continuing to provide a degree of respite for Irish consumers,â Investec said. On a monthly basis, consumer prices fell by 0.2 per cent compared with December, as transport fell by 2.2 per cent and the price of restaurants and hotels fell 0.4 per cent. However, education rose by 4.4 per cent in the month. Prices measured by the HICP, which does not include items such as mortgage interest, fell by 0.1 per cent year on year. (Online News) .

Ireland facing âlost decadeâ, says economist Stiglitz Ireland facing âlost decadeâ, says economist Stiglitz âGood shareâ of blame has to go to ECB and European Commission for not restructuring debts Joseph Stiglitz: said it was a âdeep mistakeâ to bail out the bondholders Ireland is facing a lost decade as a result of the troika bailout, Nobel prize-winner Joseph Stiglitz said, as the country neared the end of its bailout programme. Speaking on RTÃ Radio 1 yesterday, Mr Stiglitz said it was a âdeep mistakeâ to bail out the bondholders. He said he was âastonishedâ at how Irish people accepted the situation without protest. âA good share of the blame has to go to the ECB and [European] Commission for not restructuring the debts,â Mr Stiglitz said. He said the ECB and others wanted to save the banks, âso it was a trade- off between banks all over Europe and the Irish citizensâ.He predicted a âlost decadeâ for the Irish economy before it got back on its feet, and the country would be unlikely to get back on the growth path it was previously on. âWill you get back to where you were with maybe a lost decade? Yes, I think you will. But it will be a lost decade, at least.â Austerity âessentially never workedâ he said, adding that the decision to stay in the euro was probably the right one. His comments came as the troika said Irelandâs programme remains âon track in the context of the nascent economic recoveryâ. Comments are closed for this article.
It is in Irelandâs interests to stop blocking a tax on financial transactions It is in Irelandâs interests to stop blocking a tax on financial transactions Opinion: The financial services lobby is by far the most important and powerful in Ireland The Financial Services Centre in Dublin. âIreland opposes the FTT because the IFSC lobby opposes it.â Photograph: Bryan OâBrien In some real and surreal ways, we do not live in a country. We live in a story. Ireland has always been, not just a place but a narrative, a tale we spin for others. Most recently, we have been telling the story we think Germany wants to hear. It is a success story, a tale of plucky little Ireland, taking the punishment it deserves, suffering in silence and then emerging, lessons learned, into a brighter day. The problem is that we told this tale far too convincingly. We are trapped in a convenient fiction. Our fate is being determined right now in the negotiations for Angela Merkelâs new coalition government. What happens in Berlin in the coming weeks is massively more important to us than our own upcoming budget. Which is why the most chilling words we could read are those of Arthur Beesley and Suzanne Lynchâs report in Fridayâs Online News: âIn German official circles right now, the clear sense remains that Ireland is not a cause for any concern and that the likely return to private bond markets demonstrates that the State has no need for any more debt relief.â This belief that Ireland does not need debt relief has everything to do with the story we have spun (weâre grand) and nothing to do with the reality: that if you put public and private debt together we are the most indebted people in the world. This reality was spelled out by the International Monetary Fund in its eighth report on Ireland. The IMF pointed out that the Governmentâs magic trick on the promissory notes, hailed as a triumph for domestic political consumption, actually does very little to reduce the Stateâs debt mountain, creating âonly a marginal improvement in the debt outlookâ. It described Irelandâs unemployment and underemployment rate (which it put at 23 per cent) as âstaggeringâ. And it pointed out that without the significant economic growth that is always being promised for ânext yearâ, Irelandâs debt levels will rise to 134 per cent of GDP in 2018 and 150 per cent in 2021.

Lack of regular bed-time disrupts circadian rhythms, while sleep deprivation slows brain development Lack of regular bed-time disrupts circadian rhythms, while sleep deprivation slows brain development Children who switched to a more regular bed-time had clear improvements in their behaviour, according to the research published today in the medical journal Paediatrics. Late or irregular bed-times for children can induce symptoms similar to jet lag as well as behavioural problems and slower development, a British survey has found. Some 10,000 children born between September 2000 and January 2002 were checked by researchers from University College London (UCL) at ages three, five and seven. Children with late, or irregular bed-times displayed more hyperactivity and conduct problems and problems with peers as well as emotional difficulties the older they got. The results are particularly striking because the research team deliberately excluded from their study all children who were known to have ADHD, autism or Asperger syndrome. âDisruptions to sleep, especially if they occur at key times in development, could have important lifelong impacts on health,â said Yvonne Kelly of UCLâs Epidemiology & Public Health department. In the study one-tenth of seven-year-olds were in bed before 7.30pm; a quarter between then and 8pm; a third between 8pm and 8.30pm, one in seven between 8.30pm and 9pm, while 9 per cent were in bed after 9pm. Children who switched to a more regular bed-time had clear improvements in their behaviour, according to the research published today in the medical journal Paediatrics. Researchers believe that the lack of a regular bed-time disrupts the bodyâs circadian rhythms, while sleep deprivation slows brain development. âNot having fixed bed-times, accompanied by a constant sense of flux, induces a state of body and mind akin to jet lag and this matters for healthy development and daily functioning,â Prof Kelly said. Children with late or irregular bed-times are more likely to come from poorer homes, to skip breakfast, and to have a TV in their bedrooms, the researchers found. However, habits can be changed: âOur findings suggest the effects are reversible. For example, children who change from not having to having regular bedtimes show improvements.â However, the UCL researchers acknowledged the difficulties faced by parents: âRoutines can be difficult to maintain when [both] are working long, and potentially unsociable hours.â Comments are closed for this article.
Late teenager appeals to young people to talk about their problems Late teenager appeals to young people to talk about their problems The Health Service Executive has released a short video about Kerry teenager Donal Walsh , who made an impassioned plea for young people to talk about their problems before he died from cancer in May. The 16-year-old wrote an open letter to the media about young people and suicide earlier this year, before appearing on RTÃâs Saturday Night Show where he spoke about how he was coping with his illness, and encouraged others who are feeling low to talk to someone they trust. The video, which is aimed at 15- to 19-year-olds, features excerpts from the show, as well as an interview with Donal filmed at his home in Tralee. âWhen I am feeling low because of what happened to me I take time to think, I try to realise where the good is in my life over the bad things,â he said. âI talk to my parents, or find a friend to talk to, and weâd look ahead in life, weâd see where I was going to go or what I was going to do, or weâd talk about what my dreams are and what my hopes are for the future. âI would say someone who is standing there in a room and they feel there is no windows and no doors, just black, to take time, a door will open and someone will be at that door. You can go to the door as well. Anyone can find their own door out. They just have to ask. It takes a lot of courage to ask.â Irish musician Niall âBressieâ Breslin, who has talked openly about his own mental health issues in recent months, provided the voiceover. The film, played on the Saturday Night Show last night, was made with the support of the Walsh family by the HSEâs National Office of Suicide Prevention, at the request of Minister of State with responsibility for mental health Kathleen Lynch. .

Latest CSO figures show net situation remains unchanged on 2011 Latest CSO figures show net situation remains unchanged on 2011 The level of foreign direct investment into Ireland increased during 2012 by â¬33 billion, with the bulk of the money coming by way of the Netherlands (â¬22 billion) and Asia (â¬5 billion), according to the latest figures from the Central Statistics Office . The Irish stock of direct investment abroad (ie investment abroad by Irish-based entities) increased by â¬32 billion, mainly as a result of investments in companies in offshore islands in the Caribbean (â¬13 billion) and in Europe (â¬10 billion), mainly the Netherlands and Luxembourg. The net position at the end of 2012 was a surplus of â¬31 billion, unchanged from the net position at the end of 2012. The level of direct investment abroad at the end of 2012 was â¬288 billion, while the level of total foreign direct investment into Ireland was â¬258 billion. Investment abroad by enterprises located in Ireland was mainly into the services sector, where the level of investment increased by â¬29 billion by the end of 2012. More than half of this, â¬64 per cent, was into the EU. The largest sector for inward investment was financial intermediation (â¬113 billion), which comprised 44 per cent of the total stock of inward investment at the end of 2012. .

Lifestyle 'governs mobile choice' Lifestyle 'governs mobile choice' Faster, better or funkier hardware alone is not going to help phone firms sell more handsets, research suggests. Instead, phone firms keen to get more out of their customers should not just be pushing the technology for its own sake. Consumers are far more interested in how handsets fit in with their lifestyle than they are in screen size, onboard memory or the chip inside, shows an in-depth study by telecommunications company Ericsson. "Historically in the industry there has been too much focus on using technology," said Dr Michael Bjorn, senior advisor on mobile media at Ericsson's consumer and enterprise lab. "We have to stop saying that these technologies will change their lives," he said. "We should try to speak to consumers in their own language and help them see how it fits in with what they are doing," he told the Online News News website. For the study, Ericsson interviewed 14,000 mobile phone owners on the ways they use their phone. "People's habits remain the same," said Dr Bjorn. "They just move the activity into the mobile phone as it's a much more convenient way to do it." One good example of this was diary-writing among younger people, he said. While diaries have always been popular, a mobile phone -- especially one equipped with a camera -- helps them keep it in a different form. Youngsters' use of text messages also reflects their desire to chat and keep in contact with friends and again just lets them do it in a slightly changed way. Dr Bjorn said that although consumers do what they always did but use a phone to do it, the sheer variety of what the new handset technologies make possible does gradually drive new habits and lifestyles. Ericsson's research has shown that consumers divide into different "tribes" that use phones in different ways. Dr Bjorn said groups dubbed "pioneers" and "materialists" were most interested in trying new things and were behind the start of many trends in phone use. "For instance," he said, "older people are using SMS much more than they did five years ago." This was because younger users, often the children of ageing mobile owners, encouraged older people to try it so they could keep in touch. Another factor governing the speed of change in mobile phone use was the simple speed with which new devices are bought by pioneers and materialists. Only when about 25% of people have handsets with new innovations on them, such as cameras, can consumers stop worrying that if they send a picture message the person at the other end will be able to see it. Once this significant number of users is passed, use of new innovations tends to take off. Dr Bjorn said that early reports of camera phone usage in Japan seemed to imply that the innovation was going to be a flop. However, he said, now 45% of the Japanese people Ericsson questioned use their camera phone at least once a month. In 2003 the figure was 29%. Similarly, across Europe the numbers of people taking snaps with cameras is starting to rise. In 2003 only 4% of the people in the UK took a phonecam snap at least once a month. Now the figure is 14%. Similar rises have been seen in many other European nations. Dr Bjorn said that people also used their camera phones in very different ways to film and even digital cameras. "Usage patterns for digital cameras are almost exactly replacing usage patterns for analogue cameras," he said. Digital cameras tend to be used on significant events such as weddings, holidays and birthdays. By contrast, he said, camera phones were being used much more to capture a moment and were being woven into everyday life. Return to results
Linesman defends disallowed goal Linesman defends disallowed goal Linesman Rob Lewis has defended his role in Tottenham's disallowed goal against Manchester United. Pedro Mendes' shot clearly crossed the line and Lewis has been criticised for his positioning in the incident. Lewis said: "The Spurs player shot from distance and I was doing my primary job which was to stand in line with the last defender and watch for an offside. "There was nothing I could have done differently apart from run faster than Linford Christie." He added: "When the ball landed I was still 25 yards from goal and it was impossible to judge if it had crossed the line." Tottenham boss Martin Jol criticised the decision, which cost his side three points. "The referee is already wearing an earpiece so why can't we just stop the game and get the decision right," said Jol after the 0-0 draw. "But at the end of the day it's so obvious that Pedro's shot was over the line it's incredible. "We feel robbed but it's difficult for the linesman and referee to see it." Mendes shot from 50 yards and United goalkeeper Roy Carroll spilled the ball into his own net before hooking it clear. Jol added: "We are not talking about the ball being a couple of centimetres or an inch or two over the line, it was a metre inside the goal. "What really annoys me is that we are here in 2005, watching something on a TV monitor within two seconds of the incident occurring and the referee isn't told about it. "We didn't play particularly well but I am pleased - even now - with a point, although we should have had three." Mendes could not believe the 'goal' was not given after seeing a replay. He said: "My reaction on the pitch was to celebrate. "It was a very nice goal, it was clearly over the line - I've never seen one so over the line and not given in my career. "It's really, really over. What can you do but laugh about it? It's a nice goal and one to keep in my memory even though it didn't count. "It's not every game you score from the halfway line." Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson sympathised with Tottenham and said the incident highlighted the need for video technology. "I think it hammers home what a lot of people have been asking for and that's that technology should play a part in the game," Ferguson told MUTV. "What I was against originally was the time factor in video replays. "But I read an article the other day which suggested that if a referee can't make up his mind after 30 seconds of watching a video replay then the game should carry on. "Thirty seconds is about the same amount of time it takes to organise a free-kick or take a corner or a goal-kick. So you wouldn't be wasting a lot of time. "I think you could start off by using it for goal-line decisions. I think that would be an opening into a new area of football." Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger also used the incident to highlight the need for video technology. "When the whole world apart from the referee has seen there should be a goal at Old Trafford, that just reinforces what I feel - there should be video evidence," said Wenger. "It's a great example of where the referee could have asked to see a replay and would have seen in five seconds that it was a goal."
Liverpool revel in night of glory Liverpool revel in night of glory Liverpool manager Rafael Benitez said their qualification for the next stage of the Champions League was "one of the proudest nights of my career." The Reds beat Olympiakos 3-1 with a late Steven Gerrard strike and Benitez said: "It was a really great night. "The players ran hard all the time and you see how much it means to the fans. "We knew before the game that it was very important for the club to gain these extra finances. For Liverpool, this result is very, very important." Benitez hailed Gerrard for his match-winning strike four minutes from time and also the Anfield crowd for sticking by their side after they had fallen a goal behind at the interval. The Reds scored three second-half goals in a sensational comeback capped by Gerrard's 20-yard drive. He added: "Steven can play all over the pitch and he influences every part of the game. "I have said to him many times that he has the freedom because he has talent and is very important to us. "I felt that the difference between the sides was really our supporters, I cannot thank them enough. "I want to say thank-you to the supporters, they were magnificent to help us achieve this result." Gerrard admitted he thought they were going out of the Champions League after trailing 1-0 at half-time. He said: "I'd be lying if I thought we were going through when we were losing at half-time. "We had a mountain to climb, but we have climbed it and credit to everyone. "That was one of the best goals I have scored, I caught it sweet, I haven't caught one like that for ages. It was a massive night for me and the team." Liverpool's win means all four of England's Champions League representatives have reached the knockout stages for the first time. Return to results
Man City 1-1 Newcastle Man City 1-1 Newcastle Alan Shearer hit his 250th Premiership goal to help Newcastle earn a battling draw against Manchester City. Shearer put Newcastle ahead when he raced on to a raking crossfield ball from Titus Bramble and smashed the ball into the roof of the net. City were inept early on but levelled after the break when Bramble fouled Shaun Wright-Phillips in the box and Robbie Fowler scored from the spot. The home side controlled the closing stages but had to settle for a point. City had handed a debut to loan signing Kiki Musampa on the left-hand of midfield, while Bramble was recalled to the Newcastle defence after Jean-Alain Boumsong failed a late fitness test. Neither side had created anything in front of goal before the Magpies took the lead with nine minutes gone. Bramble's long ball caught out Ben Thatcher, and Shearer ran clear to smash the ball past David James and into the roof of the net. Shearer was involved again soon after as Shola Ameobi came close to making it 2-0 with a curling effort from the edge of the box which flew just over. The Magpies were well on top and City did not manage an effort on goal until Jon Macken sent a looping near-post header high and wide of the target from Thatcher's cross on 28 minutes. Kevin Keegan's men had been struggling when going forward but they were almost gifted a bizarre equaliser before the break when Shay Given completely mis-kicked a Jermaine Jenas back-pass and only just managed to recover and clear. City desperately needed to start the second half with a bang - and they got the break they needed within four minutes. Macken's clever flick released Wright-Phillips and all Bramble could do was haul him down in the box. Referee Andy D'Urso had no hesitation in pointing to the spot and Fowler stepped up to stroke the ball confidently home. That gave City the boost they craved and they pressed forward looking for a second goal. The tide had turned after Newcastle's earlier dominance and Graeme Souness responded by bringing on Nicky Butt for Kieron Dyer to try to increase his side's resilience. But despite City enjoying the lion's share of possession the Magpies were still threatening - Bramble going close with a snapshot from just inside the area. By the end the torrential rain had made conditions treacherous and both sides were struggling to keep hold of the ball. There was still time for Celestine Babayaro to break into the box but he mis-controlled and Newcastle's final chance of snatching victory had gone. - Manchester City manager Kevin Keegan: "At half-time I told the players we needed to up our tempo. We needed to get the crowd going and show we wanted to win the game. "We started the second half well and at the end we were the side going to win. "We would have lost this game last year but we found it within ourselves to get something out of it." - Newcastle manager Graeme Souness on his hopes to persuade Alan Shearer not to retire in the summer: "He is a great example and I have not given up hope. "Put it this way. It will be an easier decision for him if he scores every week as he is now only 14 away from Jackie Milburn's club record (of 186). "He has now scored 250 Premiership goals in a career where he has suffered two very serious injuries. Without those you could have been talking somewhere in the region of 300."

Manufacturing and services performing better than expected Manufacturing and services performing better than expected Manufacturing, which had a weak start to the year, picked up the pace in November. Germanyâs private sector has grown faster in November, with manufacturing and services performing better than expected, a survey showed today, suggesting Europeâs largest economy is steadily expanding. Markitâs preliminary composite Purchasing Managersâ Index (PMI), which tracks growth in the manufacturing and services sectors and covers more than two-thirds of the economy, rose to 54.3 in November from 53.2 the previous month. The index was comfortably above the 50 mark that separates growth from contraction and was at its highest level since January, marking its seventh straight month of growth. The survey points to German gross domestic product (GDP) growing by 0.5 per cent on the quarter between October and December, Markitâs chief economist Chris Williamson said. Europeâs economic powerhouse stagnated in the first quarter of 2013 and though it achieved bumper growth of 0.7 per cent in the second quarter, preliminary data shows it expanded just 0.3 per cent between July and September as exports weighed. âNovemberâs survey suggests that the German economy has built up a head of steam through the final quarter of 2013 and is well on track to achieve growth of close to 0.5 per cent for the calendar year,â said Tim Moore, senior economist at Markit. That is in line with the governmentâs forecast for economic expansion this year. âThere are also signs that solid growth momentum should be sustained over the months ahead, as new business received by private sector firms increased at the steepest pace for almost two-and-a-half years,â he added. Manufacturing, which had a weak start to the year, picked up the pace in November. A sub-index tracking the sector, which makes up about a fifth of the economy, climbed to 52.5 from 51.7 in October - above the consensus forecast in a Online News poll for 52.0 - as factories churned out more goods and took on more new orders. Bookings from abroad increased and manufacturers benefited from improved margins as factory-gate prices rose more sharply than their costs, but despite these bright spots, they cut jobs for an eighth consecutive month in a sign of lingering caution. The services sector fared well, with a sub-index rising more than forecast to 54.5 as firmsâ order books were fuller and backlogs of work increased, and business expectations improved, albeit less steeply than last month. Service providers therefore recruited more staff after cutting jobs last month. But service firmsâ margins were squeezed as output prices dropped while input prices rose.

Maternity hospital master says â¬45,000 allowance âstrictly in lineâ with contract Maternity hospital master says â¬45,000 allowance âstrictly in lineâ with contract The Master of National Maternity Hospital Dr Rhona Mahony has said the â¬ 45,000 âprivately funded allowanceâ which a HSE internal audit revealed she was receiving came from fees for seeing private patients. Photograph: Eric Luke / The Online News The Master of National Maternity Hospital (NMH) Dr Rhona Mahony has said the â¬ 45,000 âprivately funded allowanceâ which a HSE internal audit revealed she was receiving came from fees for seeing private patients. In a statement she said that her remuneration as Master âstrictly in lineâ with her contract was exactly in compliance with public service pay requirements for her position. âAs a consultant obstetrician my contract allows me to provide clinical care to private patients, as is the case with all consultants in the Irish health service who have the same consultant contract as myself. The provision of private patient care is fundamental to the health service as currently structured.â âThe â¬ 45,000 paid to me, and labelled by the media as a âtop-upâ, is in respect of professional fees from private patients attending the National Maternity Hospital. âWith regard to this, I have the same contractual terms as all other medical Consultants in the Irish health service who have the same contract. The existence of this income has been reported to the HSE in May 2012 as part of a routine confidential internal audit carried out by the HSE. â To be absolutely clear, I have never received any additional remuneration from the health service or any other source, including fundraising and charitable donations.â Dr Mahony maintained that she had been âpersonally vilified over the last few daysâ after details of the additional payments being made to senior health service figures emerged in a Department of Health report. She said this had been âutterly unwarrantedâ. Separately the National Maternity Hospital said it remunerated its personnel âin accordance with their employment terms, with the agreement of the appropriate Board sub-committees, and in full compliance with public service pay requirementsâ. It said that no payments were made to personnel at the hospital from any funds raised or received as donations either to it or the National Maternity Hospital Foundation. âThe Board confirms that all funds so raised go directly to purchase necessary medical equipment, not provided for by allocated State funding, in order to maintain safe standards for the 9,000 babies born annually at NMH.â âThe Board of the NMH fully supports the Master and her management team as they continue to work hard to deliver a world-class service to women and babies in sub-optimal conditions.â Return to results
McCall earns Tannadice reprieve McCall earns Tannadice reprieve Dundee United manager Ian McCall has won a reprieve from the sack, with chairman Eddie Thompson calling for an end to speculation over his future. It is understood that McCall would have been sacked if Sheffield Wednesday manager Paul Sturrock had been willing to return to Tannadice. But Sturrock has distanced himself from the position. "We're in a difficult situation. We must get out of it through the efforts of current personnel," said Thompson. "Ian McCall and I have had a long and detailed talk about a number of areas including the current league position and the manner of the exit from the League Cup," he added. "However, the continuing speculation is doing no one any good, especially as we have several crucial games coming up. "The minds of the coaching staff and the players have to be on those games and those games only. "Our season would of course improve considerably if in the next few weeks we achieved some improved league results and there is also the potential of another cup semi-final, subject to the draw. "All that matters at the present time - is us all having a total focus on the games ahead and a positive series of results being achieved." Dundee United players had expressed their solidarity with McCall after their side's 3-0 Scottish Cup win over Queen of the South. "We want the boss to stay, we don't want someone else coming in," said Jim McIntyre. "Hopefully now he gets the chance to stay." Keeper Tony Bullock echoed McIntyre's sentiments. "I think all the boys are behind Ian McCall," he added. "At the moment it is all speculation and we have got to rise above all that and do a job on the pitch." On Saturday, Sturrock insisted that he had unfinished business with Wednesday, who are fourth in League One. "I've only been here five months and I don't expect to be leaving very, very soon," he said. "I can appreciate the rumours because I've emphasised my thoughts and ambitions to go back to Dundee United. "I can assure you the timescale is not the right one. "It (Dundee United) is my team. I had five years there as a coach, six as a player, two years as a manager - once you've done that kind of thing, it's the result you look for. "The important thing now is I've come here to do a job and I'm going to try to finish it." Comments are closed for this article.
Media gadgets get moving Media gadgets get moving Pocket-sized devices that let people carry around video and images are set to have a big year in 2005, according to industry experts. Last year saw the emergence of portable media players, such as the Windows-based Creative Zen portable media player, the Samsung Yepp, the iRiver PMC-100, and the Archos AV400 series among others. But this year, they are set to get smarter and more connected, to allow people to find more video to watch on them. Archos launched its latest range of its Linux-based portable media devices at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas on Friday. Dubbed the Pocket Media Assistant PMA430, it crucially has wi-fi capability built-in for the first time. "Consumers are showing a great thirst for devices that store all their media in one place for anywhere access," said Henri Crohas, chief of Archos. "And now those consumers can stay connected and productive at the same time." Archos said the focus for the device is to be the second gadget in people's pockets, after the mobile. Unlike Windows-based players, the Archos AV400 series devices have always been able to record from any video source, such as TVs, as well as playback. The content put onto the devices is copy protected so cannot then be swapped to another device. Recording is perhaps a crucial functionality for those who have not seen the point of portable video if there is not a lot of video to watch on it. And wi-fi connectivity opens up the possibility of content delivery via a high-speed wireless link. Archos also announced that it would open up the software development kit to Linux developers so that more applications could be created for the device. Microsoft also made some announcements in the portable media arena at CES, primarily for US consumers though. It has agreed a content deal with personal video recorder company TiVo, which Bill Gates also showcased in his keynote speech at CES. The TiVo To Go service means that US consumers will be able to take any programmes they record on their TiVos and transfer it for free to watch on any of the Windows-based portable media players or smartphones. It also said it had launched a service with MTV to let people watch Comedy Central, VH1 and Country Music TV on its devices. And a service is launching with MSN to provide people with shortened versions of news, entertainment and other video on a subscription basis for download via the PC onto the portable devices. But the ability to record directly from TV, VCR, and digital cable and satellite boxes, which Windows-based devices do not offer, certainly gives people more content to watch on the go too. The increased capability of these devices, and the content deals that are being done, may go some way to persuading people to use them. Recent research by Jupiter suggested that people would prefer a device that was dedicated to music. Only 13% of Europeans wanted to watch video while on the move. More seemed interested in spending their cash on music-only devices. "This year, we are ready for an explosion of portable media," Microsoft's Mike Coleman told the Online News News website. "We are very bullish about it. The fact that I can put photos on here too and share them is super-cool to the consumer," he added. The fact that Europeans are far larger public transport users than Americans is one reason why portable media will take off in the coming year too. There is a burgeoning market there for commuters to watch news and other programmes on their way to work. Although Microsoft's content distribution deals are for the US market at the moment, talks were "always on-going" with European content suppliers to offer similar services. Various rights management issues have to be ironed out first however. But that does not prevent people from finding ways to create their own content to share online and swap on portable devices, particularly via those which are wi-fi enabled. The possibility is open for non-professional makers of video and audio to take advantage of the growing portable media market to distribute their work. CES, which runs from 6 to 9 January, showcases more than 50,000 new gadgets that will be hitting the shelves in 2005. Comments are closed for this article.
Medical cannabis needed 'as soon as possible' Medical cannabis needed 'as soon as possible' MS Ireland says people are âextremely frustrated and tiredâ of waiting for the legalisation of medicinal cannabis People suffering with multiple sclerosis are âextremely frustrated and tiredâ of waiting for the legalisation of medicinal cannabis, MS Ireland has said. Emma Rogan , policy and information officer with Multiple Sclerosis Ireland, was responding to news that GPs are likely to be authorised to prescribed medicinal cannabis later this year. âWe have been waiting around for years for this and there have been a number of announcements that this was coming and nothing has happened. It has been fudged all along the way. Sufferers need this as soon as possible,â she said. Minister of State for Primary Care, Alex White , this week issued consultation documents on his plans to make a number of amendments to the Misuse of Drugs regulations and is seeking submissions on these by the end of the month. Among his plans is one to authorise GPs to prescribe a newly authorised medicinal cannabis product, Sativex, particularly for the relief of the symptoms of spasticity in MS sufferers. Sativex works as an inhaler. It relaxes the tension in muscles, which can cause mobility problems as well as high levels of pain. Ms Rogan said: âImagine having a cramp in your leg. Well, take than pain and multiply it by 10 and you will get an idea of what people are suffering. âIt is a huge amount of tension in the muscles. Weâre talking about people not being able to walk, having to hold on to walls, not being able to dress, not being able to hold a cup of tea. We have been fighting for this for years. âAnecdotally, we do know people are buying cannabis on the streets, and that is a completely unfair way to treat people, to make then have to do that. Itâs not about people wanting to get out of their mind. Itâs people wanting to live their lives with some basic dignity.â MS Ireland would make a submission, she said, but stressed that sufferers had to see this product made available as soon as possible. âWe do wonder at this stage whether will we see anything on this in the lifetime of this Government.â Comments are closed for this article.
Minister commits to protocol for timely âtracheostomy' discharges Minister commits to protocol for timely âtracheostomy' discharges Advocacy group meets Dr James Reilly over crisis Dr James Reilly: gave a âpersonal commitmentâ to the Tracheostomy Advocacy Group. Photograph: Cyril Byrne Minister for Health James Reilly has given a âpersonal commitmentâ to put in place a national protocol for the discharge of âtracheostomy babiesâ from hospital as soon as they are well, an advocacy group has said. The Tracheostomy Advocacy Group met Dr Reilly in Dublin yesterday, with senior HSE staff in attendance. The group had been seeking an urgent meeting with the Minister to call on him to implement a 2008 HSE protocol for these infantsâ âsafe and timely dischargeâ from hospital. The issue of babies who have had tracheostomies inserted not being able to go home from hospital once they are well reached crisis levels in recent weeks. It emerged there were seven babies in Our Ladyâs Childrenâs Hospital, Crumlin who, having had tracheostomies inserted months and even years ago, who could not go home as the HSE was refusing to sanction safe homecare packages, due to issues with funding. Homecare Babies who have had tracheotomies, whereby a tube is inserted into a hole cut into their windpipe to help them breathe, require 24-hour care, including having their tubes cleaned, changed and suctioned. Though parents are trained before their children go home, they also need homecare packages to allow them to sleep and take care of other responsibilities. A spokesman for the Minister confirmed Dr Reilly was âcommitted to a protocol being put in placeâ. Colm Young, founder of the Tracheostomy Advocacy Group, said he was âhopefulâ after the meeting that the 2008 protocol would be adopted, though he was given no time frame. âThe Minister said he was personally committed to putting in place a structure for the discharge of children from hospital, as soon as possible. âI do think weâre getting there. I am more hopeful . . . I asked for the minutes . . . to be sent on to me, because I want it in writing that the Minister has given that personal commitment. âWe agreed on this protocol, with some amendments to include ventilated children [rather than just those able to breathe unaided]. We all agreed the best place for these children is the home setting,â Mr Young said. Comments are closed for this article.
Mobile audio enters new dimension Mobile audio enters new dimension As mobile phones move closer to being a ubiquitous, all-in-one media player, audio is becoming ever more important. But how good can that sound be from such a small device? The sound of a buzzing bee jumps from left to right before disappearing around the back of my head. The surround sound demo is unremarkable when heard on a multi-speaker home cinema system but startling when emerging from a small mobile phone. British firm Sonaptic is one of a number of companies to have developed 3D audio technology that emerges from stereo speakers. Firms AM3D and SRS both offer stereo-widening technology for mobile phones. But Sonaptic's managing director David Monteith says his firm is the only company to offer positional 3D audio on a mobile. "There are quite a few basic technologies out there, making the sound seem a bit bigger, headphones a bit nicer. "No-one has really tried before to make proper 3D positional audio - where an individual channel can be moved around." Sonaptic has been working with Japanese mobile network NTT DoCoMo to set standards for 3D audio on mobile phones. In the last few months handsets from NEC, Fujitsu and Mitsubishi have been released on to the Japanese marker which have chips produced by Yamaha and Rohm with Sonaptic's technology. "The technology has been around on PCs and games consoles for some time but what we are doing is making it more efficient so it can go on a small consumer device like a mobile phone," said Mr Monteith. The technology works through applying the science of psychoacoustics and grew out of medical research done by the company's research director Dr Alastair Sibbald. "We are basically trying to fool your ears into thinking sound is coming from areas it actually isn't. "Your brain uses certain bits of information which we are effectively synthesising on a mobile phone handset." The structure of the ear works as a 3D encoder for sound - helping the brain understand from where sound is emanating. Sonaptic's audio processing algorithms mimic that 3D encoding, giving the impression that sound is coming from the left, right, and behind a listener when in fact it is coming from a single source. Mr Montieth says: "If the sound is off to one side it will get to one ear before the other - if it is on the right it has to bend around your head to get to your left ear. "The shape of your ear causes differences in sound from one ear to the other. We are synthesising those differences." Sonaptic hopes the technology will have a big impact in the growing market of mobile gaming and music downloading. "Handhelds often have limitations - screens will be small by definition. "If you want to get impact from media you are running - either a movie, a game or watching TV - if you want it to be more immersive then our technology can help." A fishing game is the first title to use the technology, creating a 3D sound field while the gamer plays. Driving games and shoot 'em ups using the technology are in development. The technology can also be used for music - giving songs a much more expansive and immersive feel. Sonaptic offers its technology on a chip or in software and is about to release a new version which significantly improves the efficiency of the audio processing. "It's important we only use 10 or 15% of the processor otherwise you won't be able to play a game on the handset," explained Mr Montieth. The company is now looking to the US and European markets, where it has been working with network Vodafone. "We have focused first on Japan because it has a very advanced mobile phone market. "We knew Japan would be the first place to have the handsets that could use our technology. "There should be handsets out in the UK in the next six months." Comments are closed for this article.
Mobile games come of age Mobile games come of age The Online News News website takes a look at how games on mobile phones are maturing. A brief round-up follows but you can skip straight to the reviews by clicking on the links below. Part two will follow on Monday. Reviews of Call of Duty, Splinter Cell - Pandora Tomorrow, Lord of the Rings and Pocket Kingdom will follow on Monday If you think of Snake when some mentions "mobile games" then you could be in for a bit of a surprise. This is because mobile games have come a long way in a very short time. Even before Nokia's N-Gage game phone launched in late 2003, many mobile operators were realising that there was an audience looking for something to play on their handset. And given that many more people own handsets than own portable game playing gadgets such as the GameBoy it could be a very lucrative market. That audience includes commuters wanting something to fill their time on the way home, game fans looking for a bit of variety and hard core gamers who like to play every moment they can. Life for all these types of player has got immeasurably better in the last year as the numbers of titles you can download to your phone has snowballed. Now sites such as Wireless Gaming Review list more than 200 different titles for some UK networks and the ranges suit every possible taste. There are ports of PC and arcade classics such as Space Invaders, Lunar Lander and Bejewelled. There are also versions of titles, such as Colin McRae Rally, that you typically find on PCs and consoles. There are shoot-em-ups, adventure games, strategy titles and many novel games only found on handsets. Rarely now does an action movie launch without a mobile game tie-in. Increasingly such launches are all part of the promotional campaign for a film, understandable when you realise that a good game can rack up millions of downloads. The returns can be pretty good when you consider that some games cost Â£5. What has also helped games on mobiles thrive is the fact that it is easier than ever to get hold of them thanks to technology known as Wap push. By sending a text message to a game maker you can have the title downloaded to your handset. Far better than having to navigate through the menus of most mobile operator portals. The number of handsets that can play games has grown hugely too. Almost half of all phones now have Java onboard meaning that they can play the increasingly sophisticated games that are available - even the ones that use 3D graphics. The minimum technology specifications that phones should adhere to are getting more sophisticated which means that games are too. Now double key presses are possible making familiar tactics such as moving and strafing a real option. The processing power on handsets means that physics on mobile games is getting more convincing and the graphics are improving too. Some game makers are also starting to take advantage of the extra capabilities in a mobile. Many titles, particularly racing games, let you upload your best time to see how you compare to others. Usually you can get hold of their best time and race against a "ghost" or "shadow" to see if you can beat them. A few games also let you take on people in real time via the network or, if you are sitting close to them, via Bluetooth short-range radio technology. With so much going on it is hard to do justice to the sheer diversity of what is happening. But these two features should help point you in the direction of the game makers and give you an idea of where to look and how to get playing. TOO FAST TOO FURIOUS (DIGITAL BRIDGES) As soon as I start playing this I remember why I never play driving games - because I'm rubbish at them. No matter if I drive the car via joystick or keypad I just cannot get the hang of braking for corners or timing a rush to pass other drivers. The game rewards replay because to advance you have to complete every section within a time limit. Winning gives you cash for upgrades. Graphically the rolling road is a convincing enough evocation of speed as the palm trees and cactus whip by and the city scrolls past in the background. The cars handle pretty well despite my uselessness but it was not clear if the different models of cars were appreciably different on the track. The only niggle was that the interface was a bit confusing especially when using a joystick rather than the keypad to play. FATAL FORCE (MACROSPACE) A futuristic shooter that lets you either play various deathmatch modes against your phone or run through a series of scenarios that involves killing aliens invading Earth. Graphics are a bit cartoon-like but only helps to make clear what is going on and levels are well laid out and encourage you to leap about exploring. Both background music and sounds effects work well. The scenarios are well scripted and you regularly get hints from the Fatal Force commanders. Weapons include flamethrowers, rocket launchers, grenades and at a couple of points you even get chance to use a mech for a short while. With the right power-up you can go into a Matrix-style bullet time to cope with the onslaught of aliens. The game lets you play via Bluetooth if others are in range. Online the game has quite a following with clans, player rankings and even new downloadable maps. Comments are closed for this article.
Most hospitals are likely to cancel elective or non-urgent admissions Most hospitals are likely to cancel elective or non-urgent admissions Tony OâBrien, Chief Operating Officer at the Special Delivery Unit briefing at the Department of Health, Dublin. Conor Kane Up to 15,000 patients could be affected by the planned strike by non-consultant hospital doctors next Tuesday. Most hospitals are likely to cancel elective or non-urgent admissions as well as outpatient clinic appointments for the day. However, some services may continue. Notification of cancellations are expected to be given to patients in the next day or two. The HSE is expected to operate a Sunday service in public hospitals. On an average weekday between 3,000 and 3,500 elective patients are treated in public hospitals, while there are between 11,000 and 12,000 appointments in out- patient departments. Last month, a ballot for industrial action by the Irish Medical Organisation produced a 97 per cent vote in favour among the 56 per cent of junior doctors who cast votes in a dispute over achieving a maximum 24- hour shift in hospitals. Meanwhile, the president of the Irish Association of Directors of Nursing and Midwifery, Avilene Casey, told delegates at their conference in Kilkenny that the health service was facing a âcrisis periodâ because of restructuring, reconfiguration, outsourcing and cuts. Great opportunity However, she said this could also be a time of great opportunity if everyone in the services was insightful and visionary enough to seize those opportunities. Challenges she identified for nursing directors and staff included the continued growth in the elderly population; the mix of staff and the ratio of nurses to healthcare assistants; and societal changes as people demanded better access to health information. The director general of the HSE told the conference that the debate about the health service in Ireland had been âfocused on moneyâ for too long and needed to place âqualityâ as the top priority . Tony OâBrien told 150 directors of nursing that the aim of all in the health sector was to ensure we had a health and social care system that operated âto a more balanced scorecardâ.

Most who died by suicide had relationship problems , study finds Most who died by suicide had relationship problems , study finds Northern Ireland study finds men remain much more likely to take their own lives Almost four out of five people who died by suicide in Northern Ireland suffered relationship problems in the lead-up to their deaths. Stock photograph: Getty Images Almost four out of five people who died by suicide in Northern Ireland suffered relationship problems in the lead-up to their deaths, a new analysis of suicide in Northern Ireland has found. The study by University of Ulster academics Professor Siobhan OâNeill and Dr Colette Corry showed that 78 per cent of the deceased had experienced relationship difficulties or a breakup in the period prior to death. Financial crisis was recorded in 13 per cent of cases and employment related problems in 12 per. In around a quarter of deaths, the illness or death of a relative or friend was noted. The academics described their study as the âfirst ever detailed analysis of deaths by suicide in Northern Ireland from 1995â that draws on data from the Northern Ireland coronersâ files. The findings show that men remain three times more likely to take their own lives than women. Suicide rates are similar across all the middle age cohorts with rising rates among the over 70s. More than two thirds (67 per cent) of those who died by suicide had a recorded mental illness while 59 per cent had a recorded physical illness. âThis study provides us with the most detailed information to date, upon which to base future suicide prevention initiatives in Northern Ireland,â said Prof OâNeill from the Bamford Centre for Mental Health and Well-being at the Universityâs Magee campus in Derry and of the Irish Association of Suicidology . âWe need to find ways of helping people of all ages, and men in particular, to seek help and support for mental health problems during stressful life events,â she added. âSuicide prevention is not simply a matter for health care providers.

Mourinho to escape FA charge Mourinho to escape FA charge Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho will not face any Football Association action over the comments he made after their Carling Cup tie with Manchester United. Mourinho intimated that United boss Sir Alex Ferguson influenced referee Neale Barry after the duo walked down the tunnel together at half-time. But an FA spokesman told Online News Sport: "We are not taking action over Mourinho. "We have looked at the comments and we have decided that no further action is required. That is the end of it." Mourinho was concerned that Ferguson's conversation with Barry was followed by an inconsistent display by the official. "I see one referee in the first half and another in the second," said Mourinho. "If the FA ask me what happened, I will tell them. What I saw and felt made it easier to understand a few things. "Maybe when I turn 60 and have been managing in the same league for 20 years and have the respect of everybody I will have the power to speak to people and make them tremble a little bit. "The referee controlled the game in one way during the first half but in the second they had dozens of free-kicks. It was fault after fault, dive after dive. "But I know the referee did not walk to the dressing rooms alone at half-time. He should only have had his two assistants and the fourth official with him, but there was also someone else." Referees chief Keith Hackett believes Mourinho should retract his comments about Ferguson and Barry as he believes the Blues boss has questioned their integrity. "I'm hoping he might reconsider his comments, unfortunately this is the nature of the game," said Hackett. "I don't want referees or myself getting in the psychological warfare between two managers. For the second leg we have an experienced referee, and we should be talking about the quality of that game rather than the refereeing. "Sometimes managers have grounds for comments, and I note that, but a referees integrity has been questioned, that is offensive and should be avoided. Mr Mourinho should look at the facts." Mourinho added that the match was entertaining for a goalless draw and insisted his team could still reach the final. "It's 0-0, so if we win we go through and if we get a draw we go to extra time," he said. "We have exactly the same chance we had before this game. "We are confident of getting a result but we know what Manchester United is, a footballing power. It'll be difficult for us, but also for them." Return to results
Moyes U-turn on Beattie dismissal Moyes U-turn on Beattie dismissal Everton manager David Moyes will discipline striker James Beattie after all for his headbutt on Chelsea defender William Gallas. The Scot initially defended Beattie, whose dismissal put Everton on the back foot in a game they ultimately lost 1-0, saying Gallas overreacted. But he has had a rethink after looking over the video evidence again. He said: "I believe that I should set the record straight by conceding that the dismissal was right and correct." Moyes added: "My comments on Saturday came immediately after the final whistle and at a point when I had only had the opportunity to see one, very quick re-run of the incident." The club website also reported that Beattie, who seemed unrepentant after Saturday's match, insisting Gallas "would have stayed down a lot longer" if he had headbutted him, has now apologised. Moyes continued: "Although the incident was totally out of character - James has never even been suspended before in his career - his actions were unacceptable and had a detrimental effect on his team-mates. "James did issue a formal apology to myself, his team-mates and to the Everton supporters immediately after the game and that was the right thing to have done. He will now be subjected to the normal club discipline. "He is a competitive player but a fair player and I know how upset he is by what has happened. However, I must say that I do still believe the Chelsea player in question did go down too easily." Speaking immediately after the game, Moyes said: "I don't think it was a sending-off, I have been a centre-half in my time and I would have been ashamed to have gone down as easily as that. "Not in a million years would John Terry have gone down in the same way. I have never heard of anybody butting somebody from behind while you are running after them. "What has happened to big, strong centre-halves? I thought it was a push initially and I still don't think it was a sending-off." An angry Beattie initially said: "He (Gallas) would have stayed down a lot longer if I had headbutted him. "I can tell you it wasn't an intentional headbutt. We were chasing a ball into the corner and William Gallas was looking over his shoulder and blocking me off. "He was stopping as we were running and I said to myself 'if you're going to stay in my way I'll go straight over you'. Our heads barely touched and it wasn't an intentional headbutt."

Multi-purpose TV aids India Multi-purpose TV aids India Two-thirds of the world's population, 4 billion people, live on $2,000 a year or less. You might think that the last thing on their minds would be getting a television set or a computer. But that's not the case. Many people in the developing world give up one of their daily meals so they can afford to buy a TV. And now, an Indian-born computer engineer thinks he's come up with a way to give them cheap access to the internet. Carnegie Mellon Professor Raj Reddy has spent the bulk of his professional career trying to find ways to make technology accessible to poor people. The first step is to figure out why poor people would want a personal computer and Professor Reddy thinks he has a pretty good idea of why they might. "I come from a village," says Prof Reddy, "I know what the population is like, many of them are illiterate, and many of them have other concerns." "There, nobody will use it for the conventional uses of a PC, word processing and Powerpoint," he said. "So it's clear to me that if people wanted to use PCs in a village - it has to usable by illiterate people and it must be primarily for entertainment, education, telemedicine, and access to expert advice." Prof Reddy also thinks that tying it into some kind of aid package was the wrong approach. After all, he asked -- what aid group could possibly give expensive computers to 250 million less fortunate Indians, let alone the billions of poor people around the world? Instead, Prof Reddy decided to think of those 250 million Indians as a potential market. The problem then becomes one of making the product compelling enough. "It must be so compelling that you would give up your third meal in order to have this," Prof Reddy says. "People do this today with television sets. If you go to India, and many other countries, they will first go get a television set before they worry about one more meal. Why? Because personalized entertainment has become very important." This hatched a completely new idea. He calls it a PCtvt - A personal computer, television and telephone all in one that runs on a normal desktop machine. Literate users can surf through the applications with a keyboard and mouse but illiterate users can use what looks like a television remote control. On the screen, pictures - not words - designate applications like TV, voice mail, and video e-mail. This dependence on graphics, video and audio means that a computer for an illiterate person needs 100 times more power and more memory than one for a PhD. Prassana Rambathla, one of Prof Reddy's graduate students, says that "when you're talking illiterate you're talking audio and video, and that demands exponentially high bandwidth.' "It can't choke at any point in time, and it has to withstand anything no matter what you're pressing." "The major part is making it foolproof, very tough, so that it never breaks," he says. The Carnegie Mellon team says this project is only possible because PCs are now so much cheaper and have built-in audio and video hardware and software. Limited trials of the PCtvt are due to start this month in the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh. Although Andhra Pradesh has a fairly good infrastructure but work has to be done to ensure reliable connections to the net. Prof Reddy has teamed up with Eric Brewer at the University of California at Berkeley. The answer, says Prof Brewer, is wi-fi. "We're looking at the thing you'll see in Starbuck's or many other hotspots," he says. "We're doing a lot of work on long-distance wireless and how to make the network work better in the presence of intermittency, when the power goes up and down, and the links go up and down, and the computers you're connected to just get turned off for no reason." Prof Reddy says he hopes to lease the PCtvts for about $10 a month, and thinks Indians will rent the units for the television and DVD capabilities. Reddy says he can then introduce the PCtvt's other technologies - such as video mail. For example, a farmer could use the PCtvt's webcam to send a picture of a harmful insect to a local official who could send back a proposed course of action to the farmer. Prof Reddy thinks this kind of communication is the real pay-off. "The underlying problem," he says, "is how you can increase their wealth and reduce their poverty and reduce their illiteracy, and improve their health care.' "And what I'm postulating is that this is the technology that will enable them. If I didn't have it, it would be an uphill battle. Even with the technology it's an uphill battle. But I have a tool. There is hope. I can reach them in ways that have not been possible before."

Mutu to hold talks with Juventus Mutu to hold talks with Juventus Disgraced former Chelsea striker Adrian Mutu is to begin talks with Juventus as he looks for a new club. "Mutu will be in our club's main stand to watch the match between Juventus and Fiorentina," said a Juventus official, who declined to be named. "Then he will meet some important people of the club," he added. Mutu, 25, sacked by Chelsea and banned for seven months for taking cocaine, is now represented by Alessandro Moggi, son of Juve manager Luciano Moggi. Mutu, banned by the English FA, can resume playing next May. He is to undergo a drug education and rehabilitation programme. Mutu wants to train with Romanian side Dinamo Bucharest whilst serving his ban, say the Bucharest side. Return to results
Net worth of Irish households now stands at â¬102,852 Net worth of Irish households now stands at â¬102,852 The wealth of Irish households has improved, with quarterly accounts from the Central Bank showing that households across the country now have an average wealth of â¬ 102,852 per capita. Photograph: Alan Betson/THE IRISH TIMES The debt of Irish households fell to its lowest level since late 2006 during the second quarter of the year, falling by â¬1.7 billion to stand at â¬170.3 billion. This represents debt per head of â¬ 37,135 and is 16.4 per cent below the peak of â¬203.8 billion reached during 2008. Debt as a proportion of disposable income fell to 198.3 per cent, its lowest level since the first quarter of 2007. Concurrently, the wealth of Irish households has also improved, with quarterly accounts from the Central Bank showing that household wealth increased by â¬ 6.5 billion during the period under review to stand at â¬471.6 billion. Per household, this corresponds to a net worth of â¬ 102,852 per capita. The survey also shows that the Irish economy moved from being a net borrower to a net lender during the quarter under review, as the combined net lending of households, financial institutions and companies outstripped the net borrowing of government. Total government debt continued to rise during the second quarter, increasing by 0.06 per cent to â¬229 billion. Companiesâ borrowings continued to fall during the period under review, declining by â¬10.3 billion over the quarter to stand at â¬357 billion. This is the third consecutive quarter where there has been a decline in debt. However, Irish companies continued to be the second most indebted in the EU during the second quarter, behind Luxembourg.

Newcastle to join Morientes race Newcastle to join Morientes race Newcastle have joined the race to sign Real Madrid striker Fernando Morientes and scupper Liverpool's bid to snap up the player, according to reports. Liverpool were reported to have bid Â£3.5m for the 28-year-old Spanish international this week. But the Liverpool Echo newspaper has said Anfield boss Rafa Benitez will avoid a bidding war and instead turn his attentions to Nicolas Anelka. Real are believed to still want Â£7m before selling Morientes. Monaco are also in the race for the player they had on loan last season. Reports suggest Liverpool will lift their offer to Â£5m - the highest they are willing to go before bowing out of any deal. On Tuesday, Morientes had said: "I like Liverpool and I am pleased that a club of their stature want to buy me. I have told Madrid that I want it to happen. "Madrid know my situation and they know they must do something about me. They must sort out the situation by being sensible. "I am in a position where I want to play, and I will have to look elsewhere to do that. If Madrid do not want me then it's in the best interests of everyone that they are realistic. "I haven't spoken to Rafa Benitez but I have always appreciated his work and I would like to play for him. But Benitez could yet turn his attentions to the younger Anelka should Morientes be reluctant to pledge his future to Liverpool. Anelka previously played at Anfield under Gerard Houllier before sealing his permanent switch to Manchester City. Return to results
Nike defends under-fire football Nike defends under-fire football Nike has defended its Premiership ball, after it was blamed for a spate of goalkeeping errors. England coach Ray Clemence and Arsenal legend Bob Wilson criticised the Nike Total 90 Aerow ball's flight-path. But Corporate Communications Manager Simon Charlesworth told Online News Sport: "There's some minor criticism which I think have been slightly exaggerated. "Overall everything I've heard has been very positive. The ball is more accurate if anything." Arsenal pair Jens Lehmann and Manuel Almunia, Liverpool's Jerzy Dudek and Manchester United's Roy Carroll have been criticised for recent errors. Clemence, who played for England 61 times, believes the ball is partly to blame. "I certainly feel the ball is a major factor in mistakes happening," he told the Daily Mail newspaper. "But you will always get the very best keeper making the odd error and, of course, they are always highlighted." Wilson, who kept goal in Arsenal's Double-winning team in the 1970s, says Papa Bouba Diop's goal for Fulham against Manchester United in midweek highlighted the problem. He said: "We are not talking here about the ability of a David Beckham or a Roberto Carlos to actually bend the ball but lads who just welly it for goal. "The ball now goes either to the right or left, or up, or down, and there's no way you can judge which way it will go." But Charlesworth says the ball - which is also used in the Spanish top-flight - is one of the most accurate on the market. He added: "At the beginning of the season the ball was presented to every manager and as many players as we could reach. The majority have been very happy to use it. "The ball has been designed with three things in mind - making it faster, more accurate and more visible - and all of that in order to bring more excitement to the game. "It's truer, we've tried to make it as round as possible. With old balls the technology didn't allow you to do what you can do now. "You might have had weight over to one side, you might have seaming, the bladder might have not sat in the right way so you could hit one half of the ball and it would do crazy things in the air. "The idea here is we've created everything perfectly even across the circumference of the ball. "It may be that skilled players are able to create things they intended to do easier. "This is where it's getting difficult because people are saying it moved in the air. "It's not the fault of the ball, it's how the player has kicked the ball, to make it move in the air because it's a truer ball and it allows you to do that. "It might be that they are intending that. It certainly doesn't move around like a remote control bumble bee or something. It goes the way it is kicked." Return to results
Non-resident property owners to pay capital gains tax on UK sales Non-resident property owners to pay capital gains tax on UK sales Decision outlined in the chancellor George Osborneâs pre-budget autumn statement British chancellor of the exchequer, George Osborne with a copy of the 2013 autumn statement yesterday. Property owners from outside the UK will be made to pay capital gains tax when they sell homes in Britain, chancellor George Osborne announced yesterday. The move is intended to raise Â£70 million (â¬83 million) a year by 2018-19, mainly from wealthy overseas investors. The decision, outlined in the chancellorâs pre-budget autumn statement, goes some way towards bringing London into line with other global property investment locations â such as New York, Paris and Hong Kong â where foreign buyers face much stricter tax rules to shield local home-buyers from the inflationary effects of international demand. From April 2015, homeowners who are non-resident in the UK for tax purposes will become liable for capital gains tax on any increase in property values after that date. Booming market However, the measure is unlikely to have any impact on Britainâs booming housing market before then, experts claimed. Lucian Cook, head of UK residential research at estate agent Savills, said: âThis is the âleast-worstâ outcome for prime London and means that there will be no mass sell-off as foreigners crystallise past gains, and little incentive to exit or not buy into the London market going forward.â Non-resident buyers account for more than a quarter of central London property purchases and about 12 per cent of all new-build property purchases in Greater London, figures from Knight Frank show. Liam Bailey, head of global research at estate agent Knight Frank, said the tax change would have âonly a marginal impactâ on foreign investorsâ demand for UK housing. âTax is not the primary driver for the majority of international buyers of residential property in London,â he said. But the capital gains tax change will also hit British people who live abroad and retain a property in the UK. Expatriates Charles Beer, managing director at independent tax adviser Alvarez & Marsal, said: âDespite being designed to cool an overheated central London market, it will affect just as many people in other areas â notably expatriates who have kept property in the UK, either for letting or for their own use.â In addition, Mr Osborne announced a change to raise more tax from buy-to-let landlords who rent out a property they had previously lived in. Owner-occupiers who become landlords can claim private residence relief from capital gains tax if they sell the property within 36 months. From April 2014, this exempt period will be halved to 18 months âto reduce the incentive for those with multiple homes to exploit the rulesâ. â Return to results
North investment conference targets investors from emerging markets North investment conference targets investors from emerging markets Initiative follows Cameron pledge at G8 summit to help rebalance local economy First Minister Peter Robinson and Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness, pictured at the Gala Dinner at Hillsborough Castle last nigth with entrepreneurÂ Orlagh McGahan. Dan Keenan More than 150 potential overseas and domestic investors gather in Hillsborough Castle tonight at the invitation of Northern Secretary Theresa Villiers in advance of tomorrowâs special investment conference in Belfast . The event comprises investors, ambassadors and government officials from 16 countries from the worldâs leading and emerging economies, reflecting the Stormont Executiveâs drive for foreign direct investment from growing markets in Asia and South America . The investment conference will be addressed by British prime minister David Cameron as well as Peter Robinson and Martin McGuinness . Enterprise minister Arlene Foster will follow addresses by the First Minister and Deputy First Minister and introduce a list of speakers representing organisations which have already invested in Northern Ireland . The conference, to be hosted at Titanic Belfast in the cityâs docklands, will then move into private session with potential investors joining workshops to discover that the region has to offer. Sectors represented include financial and business services, ICT, creative industries, advanced engineering and renewables. During the afternoon delegates will have the opportunity to take part in workshops relating to key sectors â advanced manufacturing, aerospace, financial services and technology, ICT and the creative industries. A closing reception will be staged at Stormontâs Parliament Buildings. Taking part in the workshops will be Jay Roewe , executive vice-president, HBO ; Karl May , co-founder, president and CEO, Vello Systems; Libby Jackson , director of Belfast, Herbert Smith Freehills; Suren Gupta , executive vice-president, technology and operations, Allstate ; Andrew Brammer,head of support services centre, Allen and Overy; David Beatty , managing director of Thales in Belfast; Bill Smith , executive director, business development, Aerojet Rocketdyne; Jeff LaCroix, vice-president of operations, recording head division, Seagate ; Alistair Niederer , CEO - UK, Ireland & South Africa , Teleperformance ; Craig Rinehardt , executive vice-president of Global Operations, Terumo BCT; Leigh Meyer , managing director, Global FX & Money Market Operations , Citi ; Graham Sutherland , CEO, BT Business; and Duncan Tait : CEO UK & Ireland and chairman, FTEL Fujitsu. Organised by InvestNI on behalf of the Stormont Executive, the investment conference follows a commitment made at the G8 summit, held in Fermanagh in June, at which Mr Cameron pledged his support. The initiative is in tune with the Executiveâs established policy of growing Northern Irelandâs relatively small private sector and ârebalancingâ the economy away from public spending. It also reflects the aims of the Economic Pact, agreed with the British government by Mr Robinson and Mr McGuinness earlier this year. Mr Robinson said: âLast weekâs announcement of 1,000 new jobs by USA company Stream demonstrate our ability to attract international foreign investment. The progress in the Economic Pact shows our commitment to a long-term stable future and to our economic growth.â Mr McGuinness added: âWe want to reach out to emerging economies, many of which are represented at this weekâs investment conference. We are eager to encourage good government relations and promote trade and investment links. Plans to open a bureau office in Beijing early next year are progressing well. This will undoubtedly strengthen relations with China and develop mutually beneficial opportunities for partnership collaborations.â ends Return to results
OECD figure defends corporation tax rate OECD figure defends corporation tax rate Pascal Saint-Amans, director of the Centre for Tax Policy and Administration at the OECD, defended Irelandâs right to set its own corporation tax rate. Photograph: Julien Behal/Maxwells Mark Hilliard Minister for Finance Michael Noonan has said the changes to company residence rules that he is introducing as part of Budget 2014 will not âput an end to international tax planningâ by large corporates but was âthe right thing for Ireland to do nowâ. Mr Noonan was speaking at the Irish Tax Institute/ Harvard Kennedy School global tax policy conference last night at Dublin Castle. He said the changes were aimed at eliminating the âmismatch that can exist between tax treaty partners so that in certain circumstances a company can end up being stateless in terms of their place of tax residencyâ. The Minister said âmultilateral action from many countries working together in common purposeâ was needed to put an end to this practice. Mr Noonan said Ireland had not been asked to make the changes and the country was playing its part through the EU and the OECD base erosion and profit shifting project in addressing issues about international tax planning by multinational companies. âI believe making this change now will provide global investors with clarity and confidence in our commitment to protect Irelandâs international standing and reputation,â he added. Meanwhile, a leading figure on international taxation policy has defended Irelandâs right to set its own corporation tax rate and said the country does not operate an opaque system. Matter of sovereignty Pascal Saint-Amans, director of the Centre for Tax Policy and Administration at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), said the 12.5 per cent rate was a matter of the countryâs sovereignty. Mr Saint-Amans welcomed the Governmentâs recent publication outlining Irelandâs international tax strategy. Earlier this year Ireland attracted particular criticism from US law makers due to the level of tax paid out by an Irish subsidiary of Apple . âI think Ireland is a very open economy and does play by the rules,â Mr Saint-Amans said. In relation to a broader global culture of banking secrecy surrounding tax payments by companies, he said this had been addressed. âWe have completely changed that environment. We now are at a juncture where exchange of information is the rule and bank secrecy for tax purposes is no longer acceptable. And Ireland has played a key role. âIreland has always been keen on transparency; there is no such thing as an opaque system in Ireland.â Earlier this year the OECD reported to the G20 on the issue of base erosion and profit shifting, the legacy of which has been manifest in controversies involving multinationals paying little in tax despite reaping considerable profits. âSocial contractâ OECD policy is directed toward the elimination of both double taxation and double non-taxation, arising out of companies basing themselves across jurisdictions and ultimately taking advantage of a complex web of tax laws. âI think the Irish people have made it clear that they are a sovereign people and 12.5 per cent is part of that social contract and itâs part of your sovereignty,â he said. Meanwhile, the secretary general at the Department of Finance John Moran , outlined the Governmentâs belief that restructuring the âhugely flawedâ tax system in Ireland was key to sustaining economic growth as well as to revenue raising.

Opinion: Hiqa identified general lack of âbasic, fundamental careâ Opinion: Hiqa identified general lack of âbasic, fundamental careâ Savita Halappanavar: Professor John Bonnarâs view that if she had received proper care her baby could have been delivered by the Tuesday has been vindicated. It is hard not to be cynical about the way in which the narrative about Savita Halappanavar has changed, given that abortion legislation has been safely passed. Now, a great deal of the commentary is focusing on failures within the hospital. The report by the Health Information and Quality Authority (Hiqa) is repeating what we have heard from the coronerâs report onwards â symptoms were missed, communications breakdowns happened, and life-saving systems and protocols were either not in place or not implemented. Yet before legislation was passed, with each successive report the commentary shifted attention back to the law, and away from the multiple failures described by people such as Dr Susan Knowles as far back as the coronerâs inquiry. One of the Republicâs foremost experts in infections affecting pregnant women and newborn babies, she was very critical of the failure to follow up blood samples, or to have the proper regime of antibiotics in place. It is also extraordinary that the tragic story of Tania McCabe has re-emerged into public discussion, although virtually no reference was made to it at the time of Savitaâs death. This is inexplicable, given the parallels â there was a failure to deal properly with ruptured membranes, and a young mother died of sepsis. Her baby son, Zach, also died. Preventable tragedy At the time of Ms McCabeâs death, it was recognised as a preventable tragedy, but there were no marches demanding changes in the abortion law. Tragically, though, the recommendations made at the time, designed to save womenâs lives and, where possible, the lives of their babies, were not implemented nationally. In the Hiqa report on Savitaâs case, it says that six out of 19 maternity units had no comment on the recommendations made after Ms McCabeâs death or had no evidence they were being implemented. No wonder her family are âsaddened and disappointedâ. As a family, the McCabes have spearheaded fundraising for incubators. The least they might have expected would be that life-saving recommendations be implemented. Nothing heals the hurt of losing your wife and child, but the knowledge that the tragic death might result in better outcomes for others might be some small comfort. However, there are some people who still feel that the law was the primary problem. While the acknowledge other problems, they argue that these were not the key factors in Savitaâs death. Reinforcing the message Dr Peter Boylan was interviewed about the Hiqa report on RTÃâs Morning Ireland this week. He did a sterling job reinforcing the message found in the report that the ratio of obstetricians to pregnant women is far too low, but said in relation to University Hospital Galway that âto turn the hospital upside down on the basis of a single catastrophe would be a mistake.â .

Organisation sees positive economic indicators Organisation sees positive economic indicators Container traffic in Dublin Port: âThere has been a significant recovery of cost competitiveness, and an improvement in export growth,â the NESC report found. Irelandâs success in adhering to the âremarkably large fiscal adjustmentâ in the bailout programme has done much to repair the countryâs reputation internationally, the National Economic and Social Council (NESC) has said. In its report Irelandâs Five-Part Crisis, Five Years On: Deepening Reform and Institutional Innovation â NESC said: âThere has been a significant recovery of cost competitiveness, an improvement in export growth [since 2010] and GDP growth [from 2011] and FDI [foreign direct investment] has been sustained.â It cited a number of positive indicators for 2013, including improvements in consumer spending, investment, full-time employment, yields on Government bonds and exchequer returns. âThe rate at which mortgages are falling into arrears is declining, even though the numbers are very significant,â it said. However, the report found that several years of stronger employment growth are needed if full employment is to be achieved and if net migration is to be reduced. NESC, which advises the Department of the Taoiseach on strategic issues regarding economic and social development, said while progress has been made, there was limited recovery due to a number of international and domestic pressures. âThese include European and global economic fragility, the balance-sheet nature of the recession and the collapse in investment,â it said. Starting points The report, which was welcomed by the Government, reflected NESCâs belief that the journey to find a way through Irelandâs banking, fiscal, economic, social and reputational crises has highlighted the fact that strategies and policies can only be provisional starting points. Good systems for monitoring success and failure and institutional arrangements capable of review and policy adaptation are crucial, it said. âReflection on, and reform of, the evolving processes of policy-making, monitoring, delivery and review needs to go further and be more encompassing,â it added.

Over 300 patients of Co Dublin doctor needed to be revaccinated Over 300 patients of Co Dublin doctor needed to be revaccinated A Co Dublin GP who mixed child vaccines together is facing allegations of professional misconduct at a Medical Council fitness-to-practise inquiry . Photograph: David Sleator/The Online News A Co Dublin GP who mixed child vaccines together to administer them resulting in 335 children needing to be revaccinated is facing allegations of professional misconduct and poor professional performance at a Medical Council fitness-to-practise inquiry this morning. Dr Derek Graham, of Newcastle, Co Dublin, allegedly failed to follow the correct practice by not administering the vaccines separately, failed to make accurate returns to the Health Service Executive , failed to store the vaccines appropriately and failed to maintain adequate records. His contract with the HSE to immunise children was suspended. Opening the case, Patrick Leonard BL, for the Medical Council said the period of the allegations covered 2008 to 2011, but it was believed for many years before that, Dr Graham had been failing to follow proper procedures. He not only mixed the vaccines when they should not have been mixed, he also administered them in the wrong site, Mr Leonard said. His records were either inaccurate or misleading and when the HSE investigated in 2011, they could not rely on them, Mr Leonard said. As a result, it was necessary for the HSE to engage in a revaccination programme for 335 children. The matter came to light when the parent of a child raised a query with a public health nurse about whether the practise of administering a mix of vaccines was correct. The HSE subsequently made a complaint to the Medical Council, as did one of the parents involved. Cathal Murphy BL, for Dr Graham, said his client admitted to mixing the vaccines, and said he administered them in one dose because âit was how it was shown by his mentorâ. He was also motivated to minimise the suffering and pain experienced by the young children who would have had to receive a series of injections. He said Dr Graham believed his actions amounted to poor professional performance and not professional misconduct. He denied the vaccines were incorrectly stored, but admitted he failed to maintain adequate records for the children vaccinated. âHe very much regrets any distress that may have been occasioned by family members,â Mr Murphy said. He also said so parents continued to be happy with the care offered by Dr Graham and instead of agreeing to have their children revaccinated by the HSE, instead had them tested for immunity. âTheir children were fully inoculated against the relevant diseases,â he said. The case continues. Comments are closed for this article.
Patient appointments cancelled over strike Patient appointments cancelled over strike Doctorsâ strike to go ahead on Tuesday after last-minute peace efforts come to nothing HSE management yesterday instructed senior staff to reactivate previously prepared contingency arrangements for the strike, which is expected to affect up to 15,000 patients. Hospitals around the country have begun cancelling outpatient appointments and elective surgery planned for next Tuesday because of the strike by non-consultant hospital doctors. HSE management yesterday instructed senior staff to reactivate previously prepared contingency arrangements for the strike, which is expected to affect up to 15,000 patients. This follows the failure of last-minute moves yesterday to avert the strike through a return of the Irish Medical Organisation and the HSE to the negotiating table. Minister for Health James Reilly , who also appealed to the IMO to return to talks, said doctors had an obligation not to hurt patients. The Labour Relations Commission made informal contact with the parties yesterday to see if doctors were prepared to return to the negotiating table but the IMO repeated its view that there was no point in this because of the breakdown in trust with the HSE. Hospital groups HSE director of acute hospitals Ian Carter then wrote to the heads of hospital groups telling them to communicate directly with patients whose appointments on Tuesday will be affected. Mr Carter said patients should be given a new date for their appointment where possible. Hospital managers have also been told to contact local union representatives in order to ascertain which services will continue to be provided as normal. Emergency The IMO has said members will provide the equivalent of a Sunday service on Tuesday but that emergency, oncology and dialysis services would not be affected. IMO assistant director of industrial relations Eric Young said the time had come for action because the HSE had failed to provide a detailed and satisfactory response to its proposals on the issue of long working hours for NCHDs. While Dr Reilly and the HSE said little separated the sides, Mr Young insisted there was âquite a differenceâ between the IMO and the HSE. The key issue relates to the imposition of sanctions in cases where hospitals fail to limit shifts to a maximum of 24 hours. Return to results
Peer-to-peer nets 'here to stay' Peer-to-peer nets 'here to stay' Peer-to-peer (P2P) networks are here to stay, and are on the verge of being exploited by commercial media firms, says a panel of industry experts. Once several high-profile legal cases against file-sharers are resolved this year, firms will be very keen to try and make money from P2P technology. The expert panel probed the future of P2P at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas earlier in January. The first convictions for P2P piracy were handed out in the US in January. William Trowbridge and Michael Chicoine pleaded guilty to charges that they infringed copyright by illegally sharing music, movies and software. Since the first successful file-sharing network Napster was forced to close down, the entertainment industry has been nervous and critical of P2P technology, blaming it for falling sales and piracy. But that is going to change very soon, according to the panel. The music and film industries have started some big legal cases against owners of legitimate P2P networks - which are not illegal in themselves - and of individuals accused of distributing pirated content over networks. But they have slowly realised that P2P is a good way to distribute content, said Travis Kalanick, founder and chairman of P2P network Red Swoosh, and soon they are all going to want a slice of it. They are just waiting to come up with "business models" that work for them, which includes digital rights management and copy-protection standards. But, until the legal actions are resolved, experimentation with P2P cannot not happen, said Michael Weiss, president of StreamCast Networks. Remembering the furore around VCRs when they first came out, Mr Weiss said: "Old media always tries to stop new media. "When they can't stop it, they try to control it. Then they figure out how to make money and they always make a lot of money." Once the courts decided that the VCR in itself was not an illegal technology, the film studios turned it into an extremely lucrative business. In August 2004, the San Francisco-based US Court of Appeals ruled in favour of Grokster and StreamCast, two file-sharing networks. The court said they were essentially in the same position that Sony was in the 1980s VCR battle, and said that the networks themselves could not be deemed as illegal. P2P networks usually do not rely on dedicated servers for the transfer of files. Instead it uses direct connections between computers - or clients. There are now many different types of P2P systems than work in different ways. P2P nets can be used to share any kind of file, like photos, free software, licensed music and any other digital content. The Online News has already decided to embrace the technology. It aims to offer most of its own programmes for download this year and it will use P2P technology to distribute them. The files would be locked seven days after a programme aired making rights management easier to control. But the technology is still demonised and misunderstood by many. The global entertainment industry says more than 2.6 billion copyrighted music files are downloaded every month, and about half a million films are downloaded a day. Legal music download services, like Apple iTunes, Napster, have rushed into the music marketplace to try and lure file-sharers away from free content. Sales of legally-downloaded songs grew tenfold in 2004, with 200 million tracks bought online in the US and Europe in 12 months, the IFPI reported this week. But such download services are very different from P2P networks, not least because of the financial aspect. There are several money-spinning models that could turn P2P into a golden egg for commercial entertainment companies. Paid-for-pass-along, in which firms receive money each time a file is shared, along with various DRM solutions and advertiser-based options are all being considered. "We see there are going to be different models for commoditising P2P," said Marc Morgenstern, vice president of anti-piracy firm Overpeer. "Consumers are hungry for it and we will discover new models together," agreed Mr Morgenstern. But many net users will continue to ignore the entertainment industry's potential controlling grip on content and P2P technology by continuing to use it for their own creations. Unsigned bands, for example, use P2P networks to distribute their music effectively, which also draws the attention of record companies looking for new artists to sign. "Increasingly, what you are seeing on P2P is consumer-created content," said Derek Broes, from Microsoft. "They will probably pay an increasing role in helping P2P spread," he said. Looking into P2P's future, file sharing is just the beginning for P2P networks, as far as Mr Broes is concerned. "Once some of these issues are resolved, you are going to see aggressive movement to protect content, but also in ways that are unimaginable now," he said. "File-sharing is the tip of the iceberg."

Portable PlayStation ready to go Portable PlayStation ready to go Sony's PlayStation Portable (PSP) will go on sale in Japan on 12 December. The long-awaited handheld game playing gadget will cost about 19,800 yen (145 euros) when it hits the shelves. At launch 21 games will be available for the PSP, including Need for Speed, Ridge Racer, Metal Gear Acid and Vampire Chronicle. Sony has not yet announced when the PSP will be available in Europe and the US, but analysts expect it to debut in those territories in early 2005. Fifa 2005 is back at the top of the UK games charts, a week after losing it to rival Pro Evolution Soccer 4. Konami's Pro Evo dropped only one place to two, while the only new entry in the top 10 was another football title, LMA Manager 2005, in at number seven. Tony Hawk's Underground 2 held its own at three, while Star Wars Battlefront inched up to four places to four. There was good news for Disney, with the spin-off from the Shark's Tale film moving up the charts into number eight. Fans of the Gran Turismo series in Europe are going to have to wait until next year for the latest version. Sony has said that the PAL version of GT4 will not be ready for Christmas. "The product is localised into 13 different languages across the PAL territories, therefore the process takes considerably longer than it does in Japan," it said. Gran Turismo 4 for the PlayStation 2 is still expected to be released in Japan and the USA this year. Halo 2 has broken video game records, with pre-orders of more than 1.5 million in the US alone. Some 6,500 US stores plan to open just after midnight on Tuesday 9 November for the game's release. "Halo 2 is projected to bring in more revenue than any day one box office blockbuster movie in the United States," said Xbox's Peter Moore. "We've even heard rumours of fan anticipation of the 'Halo 2 flu' on 9 November." Comments are closed for this article.
Redknapp poised for Saints Redknapp poised for Saints Southampton are set to unveil Harry Redknapp as their new manager at a news conference at 1500 GMT on Wednesday. The former Portsmouth boss replaces Steve Wigley, who has been relieved of first-team duties after just one win in 14 league games in charge. Redknapp, 57, quit his Fratton Park position on 24 November and vowed: "I will not go down the road - no chance." Pompey coach Kevin Bond is poised to join Redknapp, who will be Saints' third boss of the season. Redknapp's first game in charge will be at home to Middlesbrough on Saturday. Portsmouth chairman Milan Mandaric said he was "disappointed" by the news and claimed Redknapp had been in talks with Southampton for "some time". "It would appear that negotiations over this have been going on for some time," Mandaric said on Portsmouth's official website. "I am surprised and a little shocked that the chairman of Southampton has not picked up the phone and kept me informed." According to Mandaric, Redknapp vowed he would not join their South coast rivals when he left Portsmouth. "I said to Harry 'I hope you don't go to Southampton', and he told me 'absolutely not'," he said. "I'm wouldn't say I'm bitter, disgusted or angry, just disappointed, but it's Harry's life and it's his decision." Redknapp became a cult hero after leading Portsmouth into the Premiership for the first time, and then masterminding their survival in their debut season. But he left the club claiming he needed a break from football, though many believed he was upset with Mandaric's decision to bring in Velimir Zajec as executive director. Southampton chairman Rupert Lowe was desperate to give former academy director Wigley, who replaced Paul Sturrock just two games into the season, every chance to succeed at St Mary's. But results under Wigley have been poor and Southampton are deep in trouble near the foot of the table. When Redknapp's appointment is confirmed, he will be Saints' ninth manager in eight years.

Reilly to strengthen private insurance regulation in new year Reilly to strengthen private insurance regulation in new year IMOâs GP committee say âno hopeâ of free GP care for all by 2016 Minister for Health James Reilly said he would introduce legislation to further regulate the health insurance market to ensure it is âfair and transparentâ. Photograph: Brenda Fitzsimons/The Online News Minister for Health James Reilly has said he will introduce legislation to further regulate the private insurance market in the new year. Speaking on RTÃ radio today Dr Reilly said he would legislate âto empower the Health Insurance Authority as the regulator of the market to ensure that we have a fair and transparent marketâ. Dr Reilly said there were âfar too manyâ private health insurance plans on the market which were confusing for customers. âThe reason (they) try to confuse you in my view is so that you canât make a valid and valued decision in relation to what is best for you and to me thatâs not right and proper or appropriate,â he said. âThe Health Insurance agency needs to have its powers beefed up so that it can dictate to the market how many policies are allowed on the market at any one given time... I am determined that we will address this issue of the proliferation of plans in the new year in order to simplify things for the consumer.â Dr Reilly also voiced his commitment that free GP care for all would be delivered by the next general election in early 2016. âThatâs absolutely the commitment of the Government,â he said. âI am absolutely committed to it, my Government are committed to it... that remains our goal, remains an absolute must to achieve,â he said. Reacting to his comments, the GP committee of the Irish Medical Organisation has said there is âno hopeâ that free GP care for all will be achieved by 2016. Committee chairman Dr Ray Walley said Dr Reillyâs commitment that free GP care would be implemented within the next two years was âGovernment by sound-biteâ. âThe Department of Health have no plan to support this objective and no appreciation of the resources required to implement it,â he said. âPoliticians talk up free GP care as if itâs free for everyone but the reality is that people will still pay for their GP but will simply do so indirectly through their taxes or through an insurance scheme instead of directly as at present,â he added. .

Ronaldo considering new contract Ronaldo considering new contract Manchester United winger Cristiano Ronaldo said he is close to agreeing to a new contract at Old Trafford. The Portugal star, who joined in August 2003 on a five-year-deal, is a regular in the United first-team. "The United board have already made an offer to renew the contract but I'm trying not to think about it," he told the News of the World. "My agent has spoken with the club and it will be resolved soon. I think we'll reach a good agreement for both sides." Ronaldo refused to commit his long-term future to the club. "Nobody knows what will come tomorrow. I like being here, but who knows," he added. "There aren't many bigger and better clubs than this one. It's my ambition to be at a big club. I'm happy but nobody knows the future." Return to results
S&P cuts Netherlands rating, lifts outlook for Spain S&P cuts Netherlands rating, lifts outlook for Spain Netherlands was one of the euro zoneâs last few triple A ratings S&P said the decision to cuts the netherlandsâ credit rating was due to a worsening of growth prospects. Photographer: Gino Domenico/Online News News Standard & Poorâs cut the Netherlands credit to AA+ today, removing one of the euro zoneâs few remaining triple-A ratings while rewarding Spain for its efforts to reform public finances with an improved stable outlook. S&P said the Dutch decision, which leaves Germany, Luxembourg and Finland as the only countries in the currency area with the top credit rating, was due to a worsening of growth prospects. Both Moodyâs and Fitch still rate the Netherlands as triple A. âThe real GDP per capita trend growth rate is persistently lower than that of peers at similarly high levels of economic development,â S&P said in a statement, while affirming the Netherlandsâ short-term rating at A-1+. The agency said it had revised its outlook on Spain, which has worked hard over the past two years to reorder its finances, to stable from negative and affirmed its BBB-/A-3 long and short-term foreign and local currency sovereign credit ratings. It said Spainâs external position was improving as economic growth gradually resumes. âOther credit metrics are stabilizing, in our view, due to budgetary and structural reforms, coupled with supportive euro zone policies,â S&P said in a statement.

Savvy searchers fail to spot ads Savvy searchers fail to spot ads Internet search engine users are an odd mix of naive and sophisticated, suggests a report into search habits. The report by the US Pew Research Center reveals that 87% of searchers usually find what they were looking for when using a search engine. It also shows that few can spot the difference between paid-for results and organic ones. The report reveals that 84% of net users say they regularly use Google, Ask Jeeves, MSN and Yahoo when online. Almost 50% of those questioned said they would trust search engines much less, if they knew information about who paid for results was being hidden. According to figures gathered by the Pew researchers the average users spends about 43 minutes per month carrying out 34 separate searches and looks at 1.9 webpages for each hunt. A significant chunk of net users, 36%, carry out a search at least weekly and 29% of those asked only look every few weeks. For 44% of those questioned, the information they are looking for is critical to what they are doing and is information they simply have to find. Search engine users also tend to be very loyal and once they have found a site they feel they can trust tend to stick with it. According to Pew Research 44% of searchers use just a single search engine, 48% use two or three and a small number, 7%, consult more than three sites. Tony Macklin, spokesman for Ask Jeeves, said the results reflected its own research which showed that people use different search engines because the way the sites gather information means they can provide different results for the same query. Despite this liking for search sites half of those questioned said they could get the same information via other routes. A small number, 17%, said they wouldn't really miss search engines if they did not exist. The remaining 33% said they could not live without search sites. More than two-thirds of those questioned, 68%, said they thought that the results they were presented with were a fair and unbiased selection of the information on a topic that can be found on the net. Alongside the growing sophistication of net users is a lack of awareness about paid-for results that many search engines provide alongside lists of websites found by indexing the web. Of those asked, 62% were unaware that someone has paid for some of the results they see when they carry out a search. Only 18% of all searchers say they can tell which results are paid for and which are not. Said the Pew report: "This finding is ironic, since nearly half of all users say they would stop using search engines if they thought engines were not being clear about how they presented paid results." Commenting Mr Macklin said sponsored results must be clearly marked and though they might help with some queries user testing showed that people need to be able to spot the difference.

Solidarity between young and old must remain a key element of health insurance Solidarity between young and old must remain a key element of health insurance Opinion: Due to late arrival of competition in the market one company has the vast majority of older customers James Reilly Recently, I announced changes to these credits and stamp duties, in order to ensure that health insurance continues to be subsidised for our most vulnerable patients. I am pleased that we were able to keep the stamp duty for cheaper plans unchanged at â¬290 per adult and â¬100 per child. This will help to ensure that the option of lower cost health insurance remains available. We have had to increase the stamp duty plans providing advanced cover (from â¬350 to â¬399 per adult and from â¬120 to â¬135 per child) to help target support where it is needed most â for older, more vulnerable patients who would otherwise not be able to afford health insurance. In effect, the stamp duty for advanced plans will increase by â¬49 for adults and â¬15 for children. This does not mean that each plan will increase by these amounts. It is up to the health insurers to decide their own pricing plans. Insurers can reduce their outgoings under the scheme by taking on a fairer share of older customers. There is plenty of evidence that this is not happening. For example, for those aged over 80, VHI holds 89 per cent of the market share in this age group. This is compared with only 6 per cent held by both Laya and Aviva . Similarly, in the 70-79 age group, VHI has 78 per cent of the market, compared to 12 per cent for Laya and 9 per cent for Aviva. I would also remind everyone again that insurers do not have to pass on the cost of the changes we have had to make. As I have said many times, they must look to their own cost base. I have commissioned an independent report on the high costs in the industry and I expect to receive it soon. I will continue to pursue all measures to drive down costs. Affordable protection The last thing we want is for health insurance to become a luxury that existing customers canât afford. That is why we are considering a number of possibilities including lifetime community rating, where premiums rise depending on the age at which you first sign up for health insurance. This provides an incentive for younger generations to take out affordable protection at an early stage. We are making progress towards our ultimate goal â that single-tier, patient-centred, system of universal healthcare for all. But the maintenance of a healthy and functioning private health insurance market is an essential step in the transition to a market-based universal health insurance system. The changes made during the last week ensure that we continue to protect our fair system of community-rated health insurance, which we need now, and will continue to need as we move to a fairer and better health system in the future.

Stars shine for tsunami benefit Stars shine for tsunami benefit Ronaldinho's World XI beat Andriy Shevchenko's European XI 6-3 in the Nou Camp as the world's top players raised money for the tsunami relief fund. Samuel Eto'o and Ronaldinho put the World XI two-up, Alessandro del Piero pulled one back before Eto'o cheekily rounded Iker Casillas for the third. Gianfranco Zola rolled back the years to lob home and David Suazo levelled before Henri Camara scored twice. Cha Du-Ri made it 6-3 in front of a hugely entertained 40,000 crowd. Several changes were made at the break and throughout the second half as coaches Marcello Lippi, Arsene Wenger, Frank Rijkaard and Carlos Alberto Perreira tried to protect the players from injury. The players stood for a minute's silence for the victims of the Asian tsunami before the game, which was refereed by Pierluigi Collina. Perhaps the only sour note of the night was that some of the crowd chose to boo instead of show their respect, but the players made sure they did not put a dampener on proceedings. David Beckham and Steven Gerrard started for the European side, but it was the World XI's Barcelona players who stamped their early mark as Deco slipped in Eto'o to score. Ronaldinho was delighting his home crowd with some sublime tricks and flicks and he made it 2-0 by slotting home from eight yards. The European XI were more subdued despite the presence of Zinedine Zidane and Raul, though Del Piero did halve the deficit with a lovely finish. Eto'o had been named African Footballer of the Year hours before and he celebrated by bagging a brace, his second seeing him feint past Casillas and walk the ball into an empty net. As expected plenty of changes were made at the break and those changes continued throughout the second half, as the goals continued to fly in. Svevchenko's side wasted no time getting back on terms, first Zola showing his true class to lob home before Honduran Suazo side-footed home for 3-3. But Southampton striker Henri Camara had other ideas and he scored twice within five minutes, both neat finishes past Francesco Toldo in the European goal. Cha Du-Ri finished off the scoring, leaving Toldo no chance with a fierce finish from just inside the box. All proceeds from the match will be donated to the Fifa/Asian Football Confederation Tsunami Solidarity Fund. Dida, Cafu, Cordoba, Marquez, Radebe, Song, Nakata, Deco, Kaka, Ronaldinho, Eto'o. Casillas, Montero, Kaladze, Thuram, Gerrard, Diesler, Beckham, Zidane, Del Piero, Raul, Shevchenko. Pierluigi Collina (Italy). Return to results
Stuart joins Norwich from Addicks Stuart joins Norwich from Addicks Norwich have signed Charlton midfielder Graham Stuart until the end of the season for an undisclosed fee. "It was a very easy decision to make," the 34-year-old told Norwich's website. "The attraction for me was to continue to play in the Premiership." Canaries boss Nigel Worthington added: "I'm delighted that Graham will be joining us until the end of the season. "He's gives us a wealth of experience. Hopefully, he can be part of keeping us in the Premier League." Stuart has extensive top-flight experience with Everton, Chelsea and Charlton and can play across the midfield positions. He joins Norwich with the Norfolk club second-from-bottom in the Premiership, but Stuart is confident that the Carrow Road outfit have a bright future. "I've been very impressed with the facilities here. It's obviously a very well run football club with excellent facilities and I've always enjoyed playing at Carrow Road," he added. "It's a nice compact ground with a good atmosphere and hopefully I can help give the fans something else to cheer." Stuart, a former England Under-21 international, made 110 appearances for Chelsea, scoring 18 goals, before joining Everton. He won the FA Cup with the Toffees in 1995 and remains a hero at Goodison Park after his 81st-minute winner against Wimbledon saved Everton from relegation in 1994. Stuart spent just over four years at Goodison Park, making 125 senior appearances and scoring 25 goals, before signing for Sheffield United - where he scored 12 goals in 68 appearances. After signing for Charlton he made 164 appearances, scoring 23 times, but recently he has been battling a back problem and had not played for the Londoners for three months before heading to Norwich.

TV future in the hands of viewers TV future in the hands of viewers With home theatre systems, plasma high-definition TVs, and digital video recorders moving into the living room, the way people watch TV will be radically different in five years' time. That is according to an expert panel which gathered at the annual Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas to discuss how these new technologies will impact one of our favourite pastimes. With the US leading the trend, programmes and other content will be delivered to viewers via home networks, through cable, satellite, telecoms companies, and broadband service providers to front rooms and portable devices. One of the most talked-about technologies of CES has been digital and personal video recorders (DVR and PVR). These set-top boxes, like the US's TiVo and the UK's Sky+ system, allow people to record, store, play, pause and forward wind TV programmes when they want. Essentially, the technology allows for much more personalised TV. They are also being built-in to high-definition TV sets, which are big business in Japan and the US, but slower to take off in Europe because of the lack of high-definition programming. Not only can people forward wind through adverts, they can also forget about abiding by network and channel schedules, putting together their own a-la-carte entertainment. But some US networks and cable and satellite companies are worried about what it means for them in terms of advertising revenues as well as "brand identity" and viewer loyalty to channels. Although the US leads in this technology at the moment, it is also a concern that is being raised in Europe, particularly with the growing uptake of services like Sky+. "What happens here today, we will see in nine months to a years' time in the UK," Adam Hume, the Online News Broadcast's futurologist told the Online News News website. For the likes of the Online News, there are no issues of lost advertising revenue yet. It is a more pressing issue at the moment for commercial UK broadcasters, but brand loyalty is important for everyone. "We will be talking more about content brands rather than network brands," said Tim Hanlon, from brand communications firm Starcom MediaVest. "The reality is that with broadband connections, anybody can be the producer of content." He added: "The challenge now is that it is hard to promote a programme with so much choice." What this means, said Stacey Jolna, senior vice president of TV Guide TV group, is that the way people find the content they want to watch has to be simplified for TV viewers. It means that networks, in US terms, or channels could take a leaf out of Google's book and be the search engine of the future, instead of the scheduler to help people find what they want to watch. This kind of channel model might work for the younger iPod generation which is used to taking control of their gadgets and what they play on them. But it might not suit everyone, the panel recognised. Older generations are more comfortable with familiar schedules and channel brands because they know what they are getting. They perhaps do not want so much of the choice put into their hands, Mr Hanlon suggested. "On the other end, you have the kids just out of diapers who are pushing buttons already - everything is possible and available to them," said Mr Hanlon. "Ultimately, the consumer will tell the market they want." Of the 50,000 new gadgets and technologies being showcased at CES, many of them are about enhancing the TV-watching experience. High-definition TV sets are everywhere and many new models of LCD (Liquid Crystal Display) TVs have been launched with DVR capability built into them, instead of being external boxes. One such example launched at the show is Humax's 26-inch LCD TV with an 80-hour TiVo DVR and DVD recorder. One of the US's biggest satellite TV companies, DirectTV, has even launched its own branded DVR at the show with 100-hours of recording capability, instant replay, and a search function. The set can pause and rewind TV for up to 90 hours. And Microsoft chief Bill Gates announced in his pre-show keynote speech a partnership with TiVo, called TiVoToGo, which means people can play recorded programmes on Windows PCs and mobile devices. All these reflect the increasing trend of freeing up multimedia so that people can watch what they want, when they want. Comments are closed for this article.
Taoiseach stresses need to reduce deficit in address to business leaders Taoiseach stresses need to reduce deficit in address to business leaders Kenny says Governmentâs main objective is to fix public finances Dan Doctoroff, ceo and president of Online News, at the Convention Centre, Dublin where he addressed the Dublin Chamber of Commerce Annual Dinner, with Bernard Byrne of AIB, Liam Kavanagh, president of the Dublin Chamber of Commerce, and Gina Quinn, CEO of the Dublin Chamber of Commerce. Photograph: Brenda Fitzsimons Charlie Taylor Restoring Irelandâs reputation for prudent financial management is key to getting more investment and jobs into the country, Taoiseach Enda Kenny has said. Addressing more than 1,600 business leaders at the annual Dublin Chamber of Commerce dinner in the Convention Centre last night, Mr Kenny also said that while agreement has been reached to ensure that spending cuts and tax increases will be less than previously forecast, next weekâs Budget will still be difficult for many. Mr Kenny said the Governmentâs main objectives in the Budget is to continue the job of fixing the public finances in order to exit the bailout later this year and to invest in the creation of jobs. The Taoiseach said the Government remains committed to reducing the deficit to below 5 per cent next year and below 3 per cent by 2015. âThe gap between day-to- day Government spending and tax receipts is still one of the highest in the euro zone. It is also unsustainable,â he said. Mr Kenny used his speech to highlight the role that Dublin plays in driving the national economy. Claiming that the cityâs best days are still to come, he said much work has been done in recent years to transform the capital from âan underdeveloped resource to a modern, cosmopolitan and creative cityâ. âDublin has become a true international city. And as such Dublin is now competing for investment and jobs with competitor cities all over the world,â he said. The greatest way to commemorate Dublin in 1916 will be for our capital city, 100 years on in 2016, to be a vibrant, attractive, and successful city.â The chief executive and president of Online News Dan Doctoroff said Irelandâs decision to make difficult decisions and keep investing during recessionary times will help it to recover. Mr Doctoroff, who also served as deputy mayor for economic development and rebuilding of New York following the September 11th attacks in 2001, said constant investment, radical self-awareness and the ability to think big are key skills needed to rebuild economies. Praising the decisions taken over the past five years to bolster the economy, he said Ireland would emerge stronger than before. âThe challenge of thinking big is that it doesnât always show up in the next quarterly GDP report,â he said. âIn Ireland your determination to keep investing in the things that really matter has allowed you to become a place where Irish entrepreneurs are building and creating jobs and taking ideas to the world.â âBad tasteâ Director of personal, business and corporate banking at AIB Bernard Byrne told business leaders the excesses of the past, both within the banking industry and further afield, had âleft us with a bad taste and a strong desire for the opposite regime to prevail.â He added that the banking system was close to being back on track. âWhile the work is not completed, the significant restructuring of the industry that has seen â¬70 billion of loans delivered across the industry and massive shrinkage of headcount are more in the past than a future prospect,â he said. âThe signs of the return to profitability are strong and 2013 will prove to have been the watershed year where the debate about credit provisions is finally laid to rest with the pillar banks seeing 2014 as the year when profits exceed provisions for the first time. We are within touching distance of the self-financing viable banks that are so badly needed.â Grounds for optimism President of Dublin Chamber of Commerce Liam Kavanagh said there were grounds for optimism about the economy but that more needed to be done to get the country back on track. Calling for the retention of the 9 per cent Vat rate, he also stressed the need to retain the current corporation tax rate to attract foreign investment. Mr Kavanagh also stressed the need for a directly elected mayor for the capital. âDublin needs its own âpolitical championâ. The Chamber believes that Dublin should have a directly elected Mayor. But that office must have real executive power and authority to drive the promotion of enterprise, innovation, tourism and transport for the city,â he said. Comments are closed for this article.
The Force is strong in Battlefront The Force is strong in Battlefront The warm reception that has greeted Star Wars: Battlefront is a reflection not of any ingenious innovation in its gameplay, but of its back-to-basics approach and immense nostalgia quotient. Geared towards online gamers, it is based around little more than a series of all-out gunfights, set in an array of locations all featured in, or hinted at during, the two blockbusting film trilogies. Previous Star Wars titles like the acclaimed Knights Of The Old Republic and Jedi Knight have regularly impressed with their imaginative forays into the far corners of the franchise's extensive universe, and their use of weird and wonderful new characters. Battlefront on the other hand wholeheartedly revisits the most recognisable elements of the hit movies themselves. The sights, sounds and protagonists on show here will all be instantly familiar to fans, who may well feel that the opportunity to relive Star Wars' most memorable screen skirmishes makes this the game they have always waited for. The mayhem can be viewed from either a third or first-person perspective, and you can either fight for the forces of freedom or join Darth Vader on the Dark Side, depending on the episode and type of campaign as well as the player's personal propensity for good or evil. There is ample chance to be a Wookie, shoot Ewoks and rush into battle alongside a fired-up Luke Skywalker. In each section, the task is simply to wipe out enemy troops, seize strategic waypoints and move on to the next planet. It really is no more complicated than that. Locations include the frozen wastes of Hoth, the ice planet from The Empire Strikes Back, complete with massive mechanical AT-ATs on the march. There are also the dusty, sinister deserts of Tatooine and Geonosis, as well as the forest moon of Endor, where Return Of The Jedi's much-maligned Ewoks lived. The feel of those places is well and truly captured, with both backdrops and characters looking good and very authentic. It is worth noting though that on the PlayStation 2, the game's graphics are a curiously long way behind those of the Xbox version. The pivotal element behind Battlefront's success is that it successfully gives you the feel of being of being plunged into the midst of large-scale war. The number of combatants, noise and abundance of laser fire see to that, and the sense of chaos really comes over. Speaking of noise, Battlefront is a real testament to the strength of the Star Wars galaxy's audio motifs. The multitude of distinctive weapon and vehicle noises are immensely familiar, as are the stirring John Williams symphonies that never let up. There is also a particularly snazzy remix of one of his themes in the menu section. It has to be said if the game did not have the boon of being Star Wars, it would not stand up for long. The gameplay is reliable, bog-standard stuff, short on originality. There are also odd annoyances, like the game's insistence on re-spawning you miles away from the action, an irritating price to pay for not getting blown up the second you appear. And some of the weapons and vehicles are not as responsive and fluid to operate as they might be. That said, it is still great fun to pilot a Scout Walker or Speeder Bike, however non user-friendly they prove. Whilst it is firmly designed with multiplayer action in mind, Battlefront is actually perfectly good fun as an offline game. The above-average AI of the enemy sees to that, although given the frenetic environments they operate in, their strategic behaviour does not need to be all that sophisticated. Battlefront's novelty value will doubtless wear off relatively fast, leaving behind a slightly empty one-trick-pony of a game. But for a while, it is an absolute blast, and one of the most immediately satisfying video game offerings yet from George Lucas' stable. Comments are closed for this article.
The Irish Stock Exchange has been in existence since 1793, but for how much longer? That question is... The Irish Stock Exchange has been in existence since 1793, but for how much longer? That question is again raised by the growing number of departures, or company delistings from the exchange. Grafton Group, the building materials company, which this week moved its stock exchange listing to London, is the latest. It has followed the lead set by many other Irish publicly quoted companies, which in recent years have switched to the far larger and more liquid London market. These have included CRH , which retains an investment presence through a secondary listing in Dublin, Greencore , Elan , DCC , and UDG Healthcare (formerly United Drug) . As more companies quit the exchange, and fewer new companies choose to list in Dublin, it is clearly failing in one of its primary functions; to enable Irish companies to raise capital to develop their businesses by selling shares to the public. As this exodus of major Irish companies continues, a steady trickle of departures to London risks becoming a flood. Ireland, shut out of the sovereign bond market since 2010, is set to return from December onwards, after leaving the bailout programme. But for corporate Ireland, the rapid decline in the role and activity of the Irish stock exchange shows little sign of recovery. Trading volumes in Irish equities, which amounted to some â¬200 billion in 2007, by 2012 had slumped to â¬37, an 81 per cent fall in five years. Of course, the financial collapse of the banks, once the largest companies on the Irish exchange, has been a major factor. Some, such as Anglo Irish Bank , have delisted; while other former financial blue chips, AIB and Bank of Ireland , have lost most of their market value, and become speculative penny stocks. In the budget, the Minister for Finance exempted from stamp duty transactions on the Enterprise Security Market, the junior Irish market for start-up companies. A small but welcome gesture â costing â¬5 million. A much bigger one by Government is urgently needed, if Ireland is to retain a national stock market. Return to results
The euro zoneâs economic recovery lost a little momentum last month, according to surveys that showe... The euro zoneâs economic recovery lost a little momentum last month, according to surveys that showed only modest growth in German and French businesses. Data from non-euro zone Britain impressed again, however, and German industrial orders jumped underlining the uneven nature of overall European recovery. Todayâs purchasing managersâ indexes (PMIs) from Markit showed the pace of growth in euro zone businesses slipped last month, although not nearly as badly as first projections. Taken as a whole, the indexes pointed to fragile economic growth that will do little to ease the pressure on the European Central Bank to take some action, although not perhaps at its policy meeting tomorrow. With surprisingly low inflation last month, speculation in markets and among economists has grown that the ECB is primed to stimulate the economy again - perhaps next month. âOur view is that rates will remain on hold tomorrow although we expect that ECB President (Mario) Draghi will âdiscloseâ that a rate cut was considered,â said analysts at Rabobank , after the PMIs. Financial markets also question what effect a straightforward interest rate cut would have given that rates are already at record lows. Overall, the tone of the data today were mixed. German industrial orders rose at a far faster pace than expected in September, but euro zone retails sales slipped more than predicted during the same month. By contrast, British indicators added to evidence the UK is spearheading Europeâs recovery from recession. UK industrial output in September came in much better than the Online News consensus, following on from yesterdayâs upbeat business surveys. The Bank of England meets today and tomorrow and is not expected to change policy, having said it will keep interest rates at their record low until unemployment falls to 7 per cent. Economists expect the bank to bring forward its expectation for when that will happen - currently late 2016 - when it publishes new forecasts next week. The euro tip-toed away from a seven-week low today after the data, as talk of extending the lifespan of the US Federal Reserveâs stimulus helped balance expectations of easing by the ECB in coming months. Markitâs October euro zone Composite Purchasing Managersâ Index (PMI) of activity in both the services and manufacturing sectors slipped to 51.9 in October from 52.2 in September. That marked an improvement on an initial estimate two weeks ago of 51.5, however. The PMI for the services sector, covering thousands of firms across the euro zone from major banks to hairdressers, slipped to 51.6 from Septemberâs 52.2. Again, that was higher than the preliminary reading of 50.9. Readings above 50 indicate expansion in activity. While the modest pace of growth in activity at German and French companies was unchanged last month, it dwindled at Italian services firms and activity declined again in Spain . âThe loss of momentum raises concerns that the upturn is faltering and piles further pressure on the European Central Bank to reinvigorate the recovery,â said Chris Williamson , chief economist at PMI compiler Markit. The ECB is likely to resist pressure for an interest rate cut tomorrow despite a dive in inflation to 0.7 per cent in October, close to a four-year low and far below its target of close to 2 per cent. Companies continued to trim prices charged to customers at a steady pace last month, the PMI showed, suggesting little chance inflation will edge higher. The surveys brought more bad news on the labour front as companies cut jobs at a faster pace in October. Data last week showed euro zone unemployment hit a record 12.2 per cent in September.

The number of employers offering their employees full maternity benefit has declined by more than a ... The number of employers offering their employees full maternity benefit has declined by more than a quarter since the recession began, according to a new survey. At the same time, the number of employers offering no extra payments on top of the statutory benefit, which was cut in the present budget has increased, according to the study by recruitment specialists Principle which compares maternity benefits in 2013 to how they were at the end of the Celtic Tiger in 2008. Maternity benefit was hit again in the budget with the Stateâs contribution being reduced from â¬262 a week to â¬230 in most cases. Liable for tax In July 2012, maternity benefit became liable for tax for the first time. For women on the top rate of tax, maternity benefit has fallen 48 per cent since 2008. The survey was carried out among 140 jobseekers, those in employment and HR specialists. Those sampled were all women aged 25-45. Some 44 per cent worked in organisations with more than 300 employees while 30 per cent worked in small and medium enterprises (SMEs) with between one and 49 employees. The number of employers offering full pay for 26 weeks has reduced from 50 per cent to 36.7 per cent. Partial payments have increased by 13 per cent which would indicate that some employers who paid a full contribution in 2008 reverted to a partial contribution when the recession struck. The number of employers paying nothing increased slightly from 19 per cent in 2008 to 22.5 per cent this year. Of those returning to work, 79 per cent returned full-time, 15 per cent part-time and6 per cent did flexi-hours. This is a substantial increase on 2008 when 61 per cent returned to work full-time indicating that the deterioration in take home pay may be contributing to more women working full time after maternity leave.

Troika adds to pressure over fiscal targets Troika adds to pressure over fiscal targets Forecasts from EU suggest Government is likely to miss its year-end deficit target Minister for Finance Michael Noonan is under pressure to stick with â¬3.1 billion savings in the budget. The Government is under increasing pressure from the bailout troika over its fiscal targets as updated forecasts from the European Commission suggest it is likely to miss its end-year deficit target. The news comes as Fine Gael and Labour push this week for a final settlement on the scale of cutbacks and tax measures to be adopted in this monthâs budget. In a draft report circulated last night to members of the Oireachtas Finance Committee, the commission projected an end-year deficit of 7.6 per cent of economic output, âjust slightly aboveâ the programme ceiling of 7.5 per cent of GDP. âOther deficit-increasing risks bear close monitoring, including potential overruns in the health budget in the second half of 2013 due to delayed implementation of certain budgetary measures.â The commission implicitly urged the Government not to dilute the recommended â¬3.1 billion âadjustmentâ target next year. Referring to the â¬3.1 billion, the commission said âthe recommended structural consolidation should be maintainedâ. By saying âinterest savings should be used to accelerate debt reductionâ, the commission made the case to avoid using savings from the deal to scrap the Anglo Irish Bank promissory notes to ease the retrenchment rate. Circulation of the commissionâs report, summing up the troikaâs quarterly visit to Dublin in July, comes amid increasing expectations that the Government will settle on a target below â¬3 billion for Budget 2014. Tax returns While the Cabinet meets today, the final set of September tax returns will not be available until tomorrow. Such figures are crucial as any shortfall in tax receipts could upset the calculations underpinning preparations for the budget. The commission said in its report that the decline in Irish bond yields since the 2011 peak was remarkable, but warned of âchallenges and risksâ on the road to full recovery as the bailout draws to a close in December.

Two polls offer two different perspectives on plain packaging Bill Two polls offer two different perspectives on plain packaging Bill Bill stops tobacco companies using colour, text and packet size to market cigarettes Two new polls, released today to coincide with Minister for Health Dr James Reillyâs introduction of the plain packaging Bill at the Oireachtas Health Committee , give very different impressions of the publicâs view on the issue. The new law will result in large graphic warnings of the potential harmful consequences of smoking displayed on cigarette packs and make it illegal for tobacco companies to use colour, text and packet size to market cigarettes. According to a survey conducted by Ipsos MRBI for a coalition of organisations â including the ISPCC, Barnardos, the Childrenâs Rights Alliance, the Asthma Society of Ireland, the Irish Heart Foundation , Irish Cancer Society, ASH Ireland and the Irish Thoracic Society â 71 per cent of Irish people support new legislation to remove all branding from cigarette packs. The Ipsos MRBI poll â conducted with 1,000 adults aged over 15 years of age shows that whilst the plain packs have the backing of 74 per cent of non-smokers, a majority of smokers are also in favour, with 58 per cent supporting the Government legislation which is due to come into force next year. Men at 73 per cent were also more supportive of the legislation than women at 69 per cent. âThis poll shows the Irish people are strongly behind the Government commitment to protect the health of children by introducing the plain packs that our previous research proves will discourage children from smoking,â said Irish Heart Foundation head of advocacy, Chris Macey . However, a poll of 1,002 adults carried out by Red C for the smokersâ group Forest Ãireann, shows that just nine per cent of people believe plain packaging on cigarette packs is the policy most likely to reduce youth smoking rates in Ireland. Of four policy options considered in the poll, mandatory health education in schools (51 per cent), tackling the illicit trade (23 per cent) and banning adults from buying cigarettes for children (14 per cent) are all considered more likely to work than plain packaging (9 per cent). âThe poll shows just how out of touch Minister Reilly isâ claimed John Mallon , spokesman for Forest Ãireann. âHe has made plain packaging of tobacco a personal mission but only a very small minority think it is the best way to stop children smoking. Even fewer want it to be his number one priority in 2014.â Return to results
Unemployment rate falls to 12.8%, lowest since 2009 Unemployment rate falls to 12.8%, lowest since 2009 CSO says numbers out of work fell by 41,700 in the year to the end of September Unemployment fell by 12.8 per cent or 41,700 in the year to September. A graphic showing the change in unemployment in the Republic between 1998 and the third quarter of 2013. Graphic: Online News studio Previous Image Next Image The Government has claimed a turnaround in the rate of unemployment is evidence of the strengthening Irish economy. Figures released by the Central Statistics Office today show that The numbers unemployed fell by 41,700 in the year to the end of September, reducing the total number of people out of work to 282,900. As a result the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate decreased from 13.6 per cent to 12.8 per cent over the July to September quarter while the number of people unemployed fell by 18,000. This is the fifth quarter in succession where unemployment has declined on an annual basis and has led to the lowest rate of unemployment since 2009. Taoiseach Enda Kenny said over 1,000 new jobs were being created per week in the economy and there were âpositive signs that business confidence is risingâ There was an annual increase in employment of 3.2 per cent or 58,000 in the year to the end of September, bringing total employment to 1,899,300. This compares with an annual increase in employment of 1.8 per cent in the previous quarter. On a seasonally adjusted basis there were 22,500 more jobs in the economy in the July-September period. The figures also show a decline in long term unemployment from 8.9 per cent to 7.6 per cent over the year. âMore than 1,000 people a week are returning to work, proof that the measures taken by the Government to stabilise the economy and address the unemployment crisis which we inherited are paying off,â Minister for Social Protection Joan Burton said. The latest figures follow separate data published by the CSO showing that the Live Register in October fell below 400,000 for the first time in four years. Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation Richard Bruton took to Twitter to welcome the increasing employment figures. âPrivate sector adding 1,200 jobs a week. Very encouraging. Testament to Irish workforce and entrepreneurial spirit. Real base to build on,â he said. Tanaiste Eamon Gilmore highlighted the decline in the long-term unemployment rate which he said had fallen from 8.9 per cent to 7.6 per cent over the past year. However, the amount of people classed as long-term unemployed - out of work for a year or more - accounts for 58 per cent of the total - only down about 1 per cent from a year earlier. The total number of people in the labour force is 2,182,100 - up 16,300 over the year. Minister for Social Protection Joan Burton said: âThere are still far too many people out of work, and tackling unemployment will remain the Governmentâs number one priority, but these figures demonstrate that we are making steady progressâ. .

Van Lieshout takes up senior post with aid agency Goal Van Lieshout takes up senior post with aid agency Goal Mary Van Lieshout pictured in 2003. Photograph: Bryan OâBrien. Arthur Beesley, Ronan McGreevy Ãras an UachtarÃ¡in has confirmed the departure of the most senior aide to President Michael D Higgins . Mary Van Lieshout , who was special adviser to Mr Higgins, left last month and has taken up a senior post with aid agency Goal . The Ãras has offered no explanation for Ms Van Lieshoutâs departure. She did not respond to phone messages yesterday. Mr Higginsâs spokesman said in a statement: âMary van Lieshout moved from her post as adviser to the President in October to pursue other interests and has since taken up an appointment in the NGO sector. âMary made an excellent, and valued, contribution to the overall work of the presidency, especially on the Being Young and Irish initiative and the Glaoch production, in conjunction with RTÃ in March 2013.â Ms Van Lieshout took up her post in the Ãras in February 2012. The Presidentâs spokesman declined to specify the duration of her contract. An informed source dismissed any suggestion that there had been tension between some of the Presidentâs staff in recent times. The spokesman cited the statement again when asked whether Mr Higgins was disappointed at Ms Van Lieshoutâs move, saying the statement was clear in respect of her work. Ms Van Lieshout has been appointed monitoring and evaluation adviser by Goal. She was campaigns organiser and policy manager with Oxfam Ireland from 1989 to 1998, when she joined the former Eastern Health Board as health promotion officer. Later she became head of research and standards development with the National Disability Authority , the independent agency that advises Government on disability policy.

When Moodyâs, the credit ratings agency, downgraded Irelandâs sovereign debt to junk status in 2011,... When Moodyâs, the credit ratings agency, downgraded Irelandâs sovereign debt to junk status in 2011, it was the only one of the three major agencies to rate it below investment grade. And the credit downgrade came with a negative outlook, a virtual vote of no confidence. Moodyâs feared Ireland might not return to financial markets in 2013 when the bailout programme ended. There were concerns about the high level of public and private debt, and the scale of the property crash. Last week Moodyâs, in a report on Irelandâs housing market, said property prices showed signs of stabilising. This has followed a 50 per cent decline in prices from their peak. Ireland returned to capital markets in 2013 and raised some â¬7.5 billion. And the State, far from requiring a second bailout, as Moodyâs had feared, has not sought a precautionary credit line as an insurance against future funding difficulties after it leaves the bailout programme next month. Certainly, there are now grounds for Moodyâs to review its junk rating of Irelandâs sovereign debt, which it has maintained for two and a half years, despite the improvement in many of Irelandâs economic fundamentals. One such is the cost of sovereign debt, as measured by the yield - or interest rate - on the benchmark 10-year bond. The yield was close to 14 per cent in July 2011 when Moodyâs reduced Irelandâs debt to junk status. Last week, the yield had dropped to 3.5 per cent, a measure of financial market confidence in Irelandâs economic recovery. The agency is right to say that any recovery in the housing market will be slow, given the high level of household debt and the flat lending activities of Irish banks. Nevertheless, as Moodyâs readily acknowledges, higher property prices, particularly in Dublin, reflect the boost to investor confidence that Irelandâs greatly improved economic performance has provided. It is now surely time for Moodyâs to reassess its position on Irelandâs sovereign debt. .

Worthington praises classy Villa Worthington praises classy Villa Norwich boss Nigel Worthington said his side's defeat to Aston Villa emphasised the gap in quality between the Premiership and the Championship. "I thought the Villa performance today was very good. I think it comes down to the quality," he said. "The jump from the first division into this level is a hefty leap. We're learning all the time. "Villa's second goal summed it up. We are on the attack, then Robert Green's picking it out at the other end." Worthington said he was happy with the performance of England Under-21 striker Dean Ashton on his Premiership debut after his Â£3m move from Crewe. "It was very difficult for him but I thought he did exceptionally well," he said. "He got hold of the ball and got shots in, which we've been shy on, so that's a big plus. It's his first Premiership game and he will find it a big step. "We've got to give him time and be patient with him because I know, and he knows, there is a quality footballer in there. "Once he gets attuned to the Premiership he will be one to watch." Comments are closed for this article.
Yahoo moves into desktop search Yahoo moves into desktop search Internet giant Yahoo has launched software to allow people to search e-mail and other files on their PCs. The firm is following in the footsteps of Microsoft, Google and Ask Jeeves, which have offered similar services. Search has become a lucrative and hotly-contested area of expansion for net firms, looking to extend loyalty beyond the web. With hard drives providing bigger storage, users could need more help to locate important files, such as photos. The desktop search technology has been licensed from a US-based firm X1 Technologies. It is designed to work alongside Microsoft's Outlook and Outlook Express e-mail programs. Searching e-mail effectively is becoming increasingly important, especially as the amount of spam increases. According to research from message analysts the Radicati Group, up to 45% of businesses' critical information is stored in e-mail and attachments. Yahoo's software can also work separately on the desktop, searching for music, photos and other files. Users can search under a variety of criteria, including file name, size, date and time. It doesn't yet incorporate web searching, although Yahoo has promised that future versions will allow users to search both web-based and desktop data. "We are all getting more and more files on our desktop but the real commercial opportunity lies with linking this through to web content," said Julian Smith, an analyst with research firm Jupiter. "It is all about extending the idea of search and getting a closer relationship with consumers by organising not just how they search on the internet but the files on your computer as well," he said. Search engines are often the first port of call for users when they go onto the web. The new foray into desktop search has rung alarm bells for human rights groups, concerned about the implications to privacy. And not everyone is impressed with the functionality of such services. Alexander Linden, vice president of emerging technologies at analyst firm Gartner,downloaded the Google product but has since removed it. "It was just not very interesting," he said. He believes the rush to enter the desktop business is just a way of keeping up with rivals. "Desktop search is just one of many features people would like but I'm suspicious of its usefulness," he said. More useful would be tools that can combine internet, intranet and desktop search alongside improvements to key word searching, he said. Return to results

Joe Watson from Swords, whose nine-year-old son has attended the clinic since he was six months old, said he was âshocked, disgusted and enragedâ by the revelations. He made his comments after it emerged that a charitable company, Friends and Supporters of the Remedial Clinic, which generates funds from a lottery, were used to top up the salaries of senior staff at a time when the organisation was cutting services for adults and children with disabilities. Fundraising Mr Watson, who spoke to The Online News yesterday having appeared on Today with SeÃ¡n OâRourke on RTÃ Radio One earlier in the day, said he had been involved in numerous fundraising activities on behalf of the CRC. These included cake sales, bag-packing, bucket collections and a poker night, âsmall things but they all added upâ. âAnd it was people giving up their free time to help me out in order to help the CRC out in order to help my son out . . . had I have known I certainly wouldnât have done itâ. Mr Watson emphasised that he âcould not faultâ the treatment his son had received at the clinic. âWithout the CRC my son wouldnât be the person he is today . . . [the staff], theyâre the front line â they do their job and they go the extra mile without a shadow of doubt,â he said, adding that it was âupper managementâ who had benefited. âThese are recessionary times that people are living in day to day â for them to hear about these astronomical sums of money which are coming from fundraising, it doesnât sit well with anyone.â Comments are closed for this article.
